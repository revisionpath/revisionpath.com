Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Hey, first, thank you for having me, Maurice. Really been digging the platform since I&#8217;ve been introduced to it. Once again, thank you for having me, man. My name is Chris Charles. I am a photographer, creative director, designer. I just try to bundle it all up into&#8230; As a creative designer or art director.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. How are things going so far? I know it&#8217;s just the start of the new year, but how are things going for you?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, so far so good. I was very intentional about taking some time off leading into the new year, so I can kind of rest a little bit, spend time with family. So, thankful I have been able to get that time in and spend time with the kids and the fam. But yeah, so far so good. It&#8217;s kind of taken me a day or so to still get into the flow again of work, and consistently checking emails and communicating again. But yeah, I&#8217;m ready to get it popping.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I told myself this year that I&#8217;m going to start turning my phone off one day of the week. So I&#8217;ll turn it off Saturday night, turn it back on Monday morning. And I tried that, actually, a few days ago, just so people know we&#8217;re recording this at the top of the year, but I did it over New Years. It was so peaceful. That Sunday was so extremely peaceful. Monday was super productive, and it was so peaceful that I didn&#8217;t remember to turn my phone on until Monday afternoon or evening. And I turned it on, and I mean the flood of notifications. People were like, &#8220;Are you all right? Is everything&#8230;&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m fine. I just turned my phone off for 36 hours.&#8221; It&#8217;s good, the world can wait.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
You are much better than me. So I have measures implemented to where my phone isn&#8217;t as invasive as I know people who have all the alerts on, the lock screen thing. And so what I&#8217;ve done is I turned off notifications on my lock screen, the one that kills the battery. I keep my phone on silent with the exception of a few key numbers; my mom, my partner, my daughter, people who they will need to get to me just in case something happens. Other than that&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know if I can just turn my phone off. I think for me, it&#8217;s easier to just have it readily available so people can reach me in the event that they have an emergency. But kudos to you, man. I don&#8217;t know how you did it, but you did it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s an experiment. I just tried it once. So we&#8217;ll see if it sticks.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I&#8217;d have to send a mass email or text message to everyone to let them know, hey, I&#8217;m out the loop. I&#8217;m not communicating for X amount of time, so don&#8217;t expect a response but in the event of emergency, call this other number. I have to have an emergency contact person in place just for that, but.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I might end up doing that too because certainly I turned my phone back on, and I guess the way that my phone is set up too, I can get text messages on my computer, I can get some notifications, but it just wasn&#8217;t on my phone. And so I still was able to do some things, I just couldn&#8217;t or didn&#8217;t respond back to people right away and stuff. But let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;m paying for that today. I&#8217;m having to do a lot of catch up today.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, a long day of responding to folks, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But that Sunday was so peaceful. I was like, I&#8217;m doing this again. I can&#8217;t stress how no pings or nothing. That whole Sunday, I cooked breakfast, I listened to some jazz, I was chill all Sunday. I&#8217;m like, I want that feeling every week. I&#8217;m going to try to see if I can stick to it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I think you can do it. I think you can do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at last year, what do you want to change bringing into this year? You mentioned taking some time for rest.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m part Jamaican so I don&#8217;t know any other thing than to work all the time. Running my business but also working another job across town, and I just left that job before the new year, just because it just didn&#8217;t make sense commuting that far several times a week. But yeah, I think for me, working smarter not harder for 2023. I think 2022&#8230; And most of my career, I spent a lot of it doing all of the heavy lifting. I&#8217;ve had assistants in the past who helped manage communications and emails and I&#8217;ve worked with tons of young artists who volunteer their time, and some I&#8217;ve actually mentored and was able to get them going with their businesses. But I think it&#8217;s time to build a team. And I think it&#8217;s time to start delegating versus me being the lead communicator, the lead invoice generator and the lead key artist on set and then the key editor. Time is so much more important to me, I&#8217;m realizing, especially now that I have a young baby, six months old.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow. Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you, thank you. His name is Cerulean Amir, and he&#8217;s amazing. But yeah, I think moving into 2023 I definitely want to facilitate me being more present, and the way these knees are set up, doing all the squatting and getting all the angles, I would rather be able to guide that process through other people who are under the umbrella of my business.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hear you.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the goal.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s talk more about your work in your studio, Chris Charles Co., which you&#8217;ve ran now for 15 years, so congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me a little bit more about it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So, ultimately, and this kind of plays into the vision for this year and moving forward. I&#8217;ve always kind of been a multidisciplinary artist, I mean with roots in obviously photography, design, music. I produce music as well. I&#8217;ve worked with a few artists and I&#8217;ve always felt that the three words that I&#8217;ve used to encompass my business are style, creativity and soul. And for me, that&#8217;s kind of the type of person when it comes to aesthetic that I always wanted to be. Even when I was a kid, I just wanted to be cool. And that being influenced by music and jazz and seeing how cool those people were.</p>
<p>I always wanted to have whatever business I ran encompass those kind of things. Just like a cool energy, a cool vibe, some fly music going on, some fly art, whatever it is. So yeah, I think my business, while I also focused on trying to strive to be technically proficient, but it was also about creating a vibe or a feeling to the point where whatever I put out in the universe via the internet, it&#8217;s a reflection of those three things, style, creativity and soul. So I&#8217;ve just kind of ran with it and it seems to have helped me find my voice over these years. So that&#8217;s pretty much&#8230; Be it design, photography, music, show-making, those are the things that I&#8217;ve really pushed to have come to the forefront.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So given all of that, what are the best types of clients for you to work with? I know you mentioned musicians, but are there other types of clients that you find you work best with?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Honestly, I work just other artists in general. DJs, musicians, visual artists. I&#8217;ve worked with other photographers doing portraits and collaborating with them, painters and also high-level business people. For some reason, it&#8217;s more like a, wow, this person is amazing. I could learn so much from them, and they hired me to do this work. You know what I mean? So it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s feeding my desire to learn more and have goals based off of what I&#8217;m seeing this person has done, and I&#8217;m actually doing what I love to do while learning. So yeah, I would say anyone in the arts, like I said, high-level business people. I&#8217;ve worked with district court judges, I&#8217;ve worked with mayors, mayoral candidates, city council people, attorneys, high-end real estate folks, and all of these people have great lessons that I can pull from to use at some point in my business. So this is great. I love that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So given that variety, how do you approach creating a new project or working on a new design project? Because I would imagine with each of those types of clients, the setup might be a little different, I&#8217;m guessing.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah. One thing I used to struggle with&#8230; Well, I won&#8217;t say I struggled with it, but one thing I had to really understand was find a way to maintain whatever vision or artistic integrity I had while still fulfilling my clients&#8217; needs. And sometimes those things don&#8217;t always align, and I&#8217;ve had to adapt and adjust in order to facilitate my client being happy and just doing the work. But yeah, I think for me, I just like to assume that people who have hired me, it&#8217;s not like sight unseen. They&#8217;ve seen examples of my work and they&#8217;ve seen&#8230; Or other people who I&#8217;ve worked with and they&#8217;re like, hey, I want that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve had some clients who have no&#8230; Whatever I do, whatever they want was the opposite. So that I think has been a big challenge over the years. But ultimately, it&#8217;s just about adapting and adjusting, interjecting those three things, style, creativity and soul while still keeping whatever format my client wants to maintain their brand and push their image forward. So it&#8217;s a lot of, I&#8217;d say, adjustment. I don&#8217;t want to say shape-shifting, but it&#8217;s more like a, yeah, I can do this, but I can still slide some of these elements that I always kind of hearken to for this person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like that&#8217;s a common thing with multidisciplinary folks. It&#8217;s like we know that we can do a lot of different things, and sometimes the client is aware of that and sometimes they just want the one thing that they want, but it is a lot of adjusting to try to make sure you&#8217;re fitting in with the scope of the project, their involvement in terms of how things are going. It is a lot of&#8230; It&#8217;s a constant adjustment, I find.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, it is. And I don&#8217;t know, I think by nature, just based off of my travels, even as a child I&#8217;ve always been very adaptable, but I&#8217;ve always tried to stick to a certain thing that, okay, well I&#8217;m going to do this but I&#8217;m going to do it this way. And it kind of made me a rebel. When I say that, I mean I&#8217;ll follow the rules but up to a certain point that I&#8217;m just going to just do it this other way because I think it&#8217;s more efficient. I kind of relate that to working with clients and just adapting. And yeah, I hear what you&#8217;re saying. I know you want the logo with the money, the dollar signs raining and all of that, but maybe we can simplify it a little bit. Here, let me show you this. So I found using examples of other brands within that person&#8217;s market helps kind of dial those things in for me too, so I don&#8217;t have to really have too much conflict.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you handle the business side of everything? Because the work definitely is the creative part. That&#8217;s what you specialize in. But, when it comes to marketing and contracts and finance, how do you balance that with the more creative aspects of your work?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It took me a while to actually find a rhythm with managing all the things outside of the art and creating, but eventually I was able to figure out a way to say, for example, automate my booking process so I don&#8217;t have to have these conversations and these email threads that just lead to dead ends. Usually if someone clicks and books, they&#8217;ve already made their mind that they want book me. So that saved me so much time. I&#8217;d also, say, having an assistant, I had a really great assistant and then she moved on to greater things. But I really learned to appreciate how&#8230; For one, she was really good at what she does, and she actually is based in Atlanta, so she was working virtually. But that type of communication, I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m a horrible communicator, but sometimes I&#8217;m too busy out working to communicate in a timely manner.</p>
<p>And having someone who that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re doing for me made it so much easier. But other than that, it&#8217;s just kind of trial and error. It&#8217;s like, hey, I&#8217;ve gone through so many phases with trying this invoicing system or trying this business bank account to see that works in payment gateways and figuring out the most seamless, easiest way for a customer to pay a deposit and then book it online without having to have conversation, after conversation, after conversation. So yeah, it&#8217;s been a journey. It&#8217;s definitely been a journey, but I&#8217;ve been able to figure it out just based off of trial and error and kind of doing what works, but also evolving, being open to evolve. There&#8217;s a few things I want to add into the mix this year. Definitely want to get someone to do the actual books and have an accountant, or someone who I can contract to have to do the accounting. Because I&#8217;m pretty much doing it all of that myself as well, so.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now outside of that, being in the arts and being self-employed, that&#8217;s a lot to balance, I think particularly with just the way that our attention economy kind of works. What are some of the biggest challenges that you&#8217;ve had to face staying independent and doing this for as long as you have?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Dealing with the economy. I think managing&#8230; Be sustainable, which is every business during economic downturns, and that&#8217;s another challenge. I&#8217;d say just dealing with the ebb and flow. My business is a cash flow-based business, and most businesses that, but fortunately I don&#8217;t have much overhead, so that makes it a lot easier. I&#8217;m not producing a physical product that requires me to buy inventory and surplus. So that in itself has really helped me manage the challenges of an economic downturn and keeping clients and being able to have clients who just keep coming back. And some of my best clients are those repeat clients. But ultimately also over-saturation. Over-saturation. When I started doing photography professionally, there were just maybe a handful of really, really great photographers in my area who I looked upon for inspiration, and I saw they had things established. They did great work.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now, it&#8217;s like you can just close your eyes and point your finger one direction, and you&#8217;re probably pointing at a photographer. You know what I mean? So staying relevant, being open to new ideas is kind of, like a lot of artists, I think specifically more with musicians and kind of trying to grow their art and their craft while still maintaining that voice that put them on in the first place. So for me, I don&#8217;t want to look at it as competition. However, it is somewhat of a competition. This is a free market. So if I want to be competitive in this market, I have to pay attention to what other people who are 20 years younger than me are doing. And if I have a client and suddenly I see my client shooting with this 20-something year old, I&#8217;m like, oh okay, great. Yay. But also, I&#8217;m like, huh, how&#8217;d that happen? What do I need to do to where I can keep this particular client or clients? So yeah, it&#8217;s a few challenges.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know when I was actively having clients and doing client work, one of the biggest challenges, aside from what you mentioned, is just making sure that they still keep you sort of top of mind with what they do. Because I think, like you said, there&#8217;s over-saturation sometimes in the market and there&#8217;s a number of different people that folks could choose from to do kind of the same work. And so I think it&#8217;s really important also to just have those relationships. The relationship building part is so important with so many other people out there, because the benefit I think that we have, you and I, and probably others of our age group, is being able to build those relationships as opposed to just putting out whatever the newest, hottest, latest, fastest tool or product is that can get the job done.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it&#8217;s about relationships. You mentioned one of the clients you&#8217;ve had has been a mayoral candidate. I did a mayoral race back in 2009. The person didn&#8217;t win, the candidate didn&#8217;t win, but she ended up working then for a nonprofit organization and I had that organization a retainer for five or six years. And then every place that she ended up going, I kind of followed her in some aspect in terms of like, oh yeah, I could do this work, I could do this work. Or just keeping top of mind so they know, oh, well I know someone who could use you. So then that relationship building really comes into play because your name gets mentioned in rooms and other places that you&#8217;re not necessarily available.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Exactly, exactly. And yeah, I think I&#8217;ve definitely been fortunate to have had several of those types of clients where I&#8217;m talking about 10, and you mentioned the foreign exchange. It&#8217;s almost like 10 years we&#8217;ve been working together. And then of course, with Nikolai individually and with Phonte individually, it&#8217;s been like I&#8217;ve been their go-to guy, and I appreciate that. I have some clients who, once again, are in the political scene and some musicians who, there&#8217;s no question they will call me, and I don&#8217;t take that for granted. But also it&#8217;s because we can sit down and kick it after we do a long shoot. We go grab some food, we have a couple of beers, and we kick it for a little while and just decompress and catch up. I value that.</p>
<p>Because to me, that&#8217;s connection. And for me, especially when it comes to doing portrait work and photographing people, it&#8217;s important that I established that rapport, which could potentially lead to a cool relationship and friendship. But I can&#8217;t get a good picture of someone if we&#8217;re doing a session, if we haven&#8217;t had a conversation that kind of face-to-face, and that way we can feel each other out. I can see where I need to go, how I need to handle this particular photo shoot. Yeah, I&#8217;ve been able to, like I said, make some really great, great friends because of that relationship aspect that you mentioned.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I just started back doing some client work through my studio now, and one thing I&#8217;ve been doing is going back through my old contact list of clients. And the first of the year, best time to do it, best time to restart a dormant relationship or a dormant former communication. Just hit them up, Happy New Year, how are things going? This is what I&#8217;m doing. Because people just kind of have that energy at the top of the year to want to do something new, try something new. So it&#8217;s a good time now to make those relationships happen or to try to at least begin to forge them.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Absolutely. Yeah. Just before Christmas, I sent out some tests, newsletters with some things just to see, once again, updating that client list and seeing do I need to remove or add some things and change and seeing the response and looking at the numbers. So yeah, you nailed it, man. Definitely going to be doing the same this year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to get more into your work and some of the clients that you work with. Of course, you mentioned foreign exchange, which we&#8217;ll talk about later, but I want to hear more about your origin story. I know you&#8217;re in North Carolina now. Is that where you&#8217;re from? Is that where you grew up?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
No, I actually grew up in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. ell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Spent my formative years in Brooklyn, but also going back and forth between Brooklyn and Jamaica. We usually go every summer, or every other summer. And Brooklyn is a melting pot of West Indian and Caribbean culture, anyway. So yeah, growing up in New York was such a great experience for me. I think I tell people I grew up, I think in during the best era to grow up, which was the late &#8217;70s going into the &#8217;80s. Because once again, I literally would&#8217;ve had a Irish neighbor across the street. Their neighbor was Italian, who was my first babysitter. We had a Puerto Rican family on the corner. We had the Haitian family right there. You had my family, which was a mixed ethnicity. You had people from Aruba, people from Barbados. It was such a melting pot of culture. So I was exposed to a lot of different languages and a lot of different foods and energies. And thankfully, my parents and I, we traveled.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d get on a plane and go somewhere, go to LA, go to Jamaica, and my dad had family in Pennsylvania, so we&#8217;d be in the mountains. Just being in that type of environment or those types of environments where I&#8217;m surrounded by so many different things, it influenced me and grew up in a very musical household and very artistic household. And I played guitar, took formal guitar lessons for years, and my household was the type of household that always had music playing, be it jazz or reggae music. So my parents loved to dance. We do the New Year&#8217;s Eve party at our Puerto Rican friends&#8217; home, and they&#8217;d be dancing salsa all night. So I just love music and culture. So, I couldn&#8217;t help but be influenced by all of that growing up during that time in New York. So went to high school, did that. Played football in high school, actually. So I wound up going to college initially at a Kentucky Wesley College with a partial scholarship to play football. And that was a disaster because that was my kind of first time away from home.</p>
<p>Being in Kentucky as a New York dude was kind of different for me. I made it through football camp, and I was like yeah, I&#8217;m not feeling this, and I went back home. So I had to regroup, and my parents were looking at me like, okay, so what are we going to do? You can&#8217;t just be laying around here. You know what I mean? You got to do something. So I said, okay. Always loved architecture, always loved art and clean lines and drafting. I took drafting in high school, so I pursued a degree in architectural engineering, the New York Institute of Technology in Farmingdale, it&#8217;s a [inaudible 00:24:32] entity, and that was great. But I also have a military family. All my uncles were in the military. My dad was a Marine, my brother was in the army, and that&#8217;s also something I always knew I wanted to do. I was a boy scout and I loved wearing a uniform. I was one weird kids who just loved putting on a uniform and being fresh. So yeah, I did college and then immediately joined the Army.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So this is, what, &#8217;93, &#8217;94. And wound up getting a job doing surveying, but it was for artillery. So I kind of got hoodwinked. I kind of got made switch with you have engineering background. Yeah, this could be a great job for you. But I&#8217;m sitting next to a [inaudible 00:25:18] blowing up stuff, you know what I mean? But ultimately, it was good. I had a good time, did a couple of overseas tours, and I made sergeant. And so now I had to manage a team, and that kind of taught me leadership and politics when it came to, not just the military, but corporate, I came to find out later.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s where corporate gets it from, so that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Structures, politics of it all. They parallel each other. So anyway, I decided maybe I want to change jobs. So in the military, they have what you can do as reclassifying. So I reclassified as a communication specialist, and more specifically a network switchboard engineer. So like an internet guy, basically. And that was great because it basically helped me transition out of the military eventually with those same skillset sets. And I was able to apply them. But meanwhile, I was also a paratrooper, so I was jumping out of airplanes and went to jump master school. So I was jump master qualified. I was aero [inaudible 00:26:16] qualified.</p>
<p>So I was propelling out of helicopter, jumping out of airplanes, doing all the cool stuff, even though I had these technical jobs, because that was kind of that guy who just wanted to do the hard stuff as much as possible while I still had the young legs. So yeah, eventually 2003, after my last deployment in Iraq&#8230; Well, 2004 is when I began&#8230; I came back, I think April, and put in my paperwork to get out the military because I just felt it was time. My daughter was very young at the time. She&#8217;s 21 now. But I just didn&#8217;t want to be away from her and missing her grow and potentially not being able to see her again, not making it back from the deployment is very real.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Especially right around that time in the early 2000s. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah. 2003, 2004, maybe going in 2005, &#8217;06 was a rough one because the warfare over there with the IEDs&#8230; And it was really bad at one point. And I was there for that when you never knew if you were going to get blown up in a convo at some point. And that hit me. That was real, that was real to me. I said I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m a smart guy, I think I&#8217;ll be able to figure something out, especially with the skillsets that I gained in the military. And that&#8217;s what I did. So I got out of the military in November, 2004, and haven&#8217;t looked back since. I transitioned almost immediately into a corporate IT job.</p>
<p>And that was great. I did that for about five years. And then 2009, the 2008, the bubble burst and the economy tanked, and I wound up getting laid off. So here I am, had a corporate job, great benefits, great pay, and now I got laid off. Never happened to me before. I didn&#8217;t know what that felt like. And it was horrible being called into the operation manager&#8217;s office with all of us who got laid off. It wasn&#8217;t just myself, walking back to your desk and you see all your stuff packed up in a box on the table with a security guy waiting to walk you out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It was embarrassing. You feel powerless, you just feel like, wow, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing? Wound up getting laid off. And I had to really, really sit on it for a minute. And then I realized that was a universe kind of pushing me in the direction of becoming an artist full-time. Now keep in mind, when I was working at this particular company, I became good friends with the art director there, and he knew I was kind of dabbling in photography, and he invited me to drive to Boston to shoot a wedding because I guess he&#8217;d seen some of the work I was doing just for free. And he thought I had an eye. So he took me, and that was the first paid gig I ever had as a photographer shooting that wedding. And that&#8217;s when also the light bulb clicked.</p>
<p>Was kind of already getting over the job, it was very stressful as far as just the IT and networking, dealing with clients, having to take the blame for other people&#8217;s mistakes or whatever. So when he says, hey man, I&#8217;m going to cut you a check for $1500, just drive to Boston in my Audi. I was like, oh shit. Okay, let&#8217;s go. Hey, maybe I can just keep doing this. And then a few months later, I wound up getting laid off. So it was all serendipitous how it happened, even though I wasn&#8217;t seeing that at the time. But it definitely helped guide me into the direction I kind of eventually went. So I took my GI bill and took a little bit of time off. Because I did get a bit of a pension, not a pension, but a severance day. So I was able to survive and pay my bills, but eventually enrolled back into college and wound up getting a degree in graphic design while slowly building my business and getting to know the community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So that was a very big transformative time for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And in hindsight, like you said, it worked out in the end. Something I want to just touch on, you mentioned though that time between, I would say roughly the mid 2000s, 2004 to 2008, 2009, that was such a&#8230; And I can&#8217;t stress this enough for designers that were not around during that time. That was such a wild time in terms of just design, I guess you could lump tech in with it, but particularly web design, graphic design. So many things were changing in that just five-year span that you were lucky if you could stay at the same place for that long because the technology was changing, the browsers were changing, the actual hardware itself was changing, the software was changing. There were so many changes that took place that it would be hard to keep up with everything that&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. And I don&#8217;t know, for me I think what helped me was being in school&#8230; And at the time I was still using Windows, for example, but we had iMac Labs where I was able to kind of&#8230; I was like, oh, this is nice. Okay, cool, cool, cool. But not only the technology, but I guess you said the design language, right? Like I said, I loved architecture, I loved clean lines. I loved a certain minimalist aesthetic. And I started noticing design shifting to that versus heavy drop shadow and beveled fonts. And a lot of overly-designed things that have, and I attribute that to Apple, actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I think Apple&#8217;s brand pretty much influenced the design world when it came to aesthetic and minimalism. Being able to be able to sell something and tell a story as cleanly as simply as possible and maybe using really great imagery overlay with text. So that whole look&#8230; Like when I started seeing that and I realized that that&#8217;s kind of how I love that, that&#8217;s what it was for me. So it made my transition fairly easy. Because I just wanted to stick to that aesthetic. It was just, like you said, learning the technology and learning in Design and Illustrator and all those things. I was pretty good in Photoshop already. But those other Adobe products, they were kicking my butt for a while. But I think I got a handle of them now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember the macro media stuff when it switched over to Adobe. I used Fireworks a lot in one of my old jobs. And then Fireworks pretty much became obsolete. Adobe bought Macromedia and changed a bunch of stuff over. And then I was a web designer at the time. There was the whole switch from table-based layouts to CSS-based layouts. Which then changed the browser because the browser then was less about just display and it became more of a canvas. It became more of somewhere you can create things just on there and not have to transpose. I remember cutting up tables in Dream Weaver and exporting them over and making sure everything was right. But now you could use CSS and you could float things and create divs&#8230;</p>
<p>And it was just such a big shift&#8230; It was a really seismic shift, I think, in design online during that time. And yeah, also the switch from the nineties style of design, especially with tables and things like that because they borrowed a lot from print, to more clean lines. Because it&#8217;s just based on what the browser did, because the browsers then had to catch up. This is after the whole browser wars of the late &#8217;90s and stuff. But browsers became less about, oh, this is just a place you can view a website. It&#8217;s like, no, this is a place where you can build a website. There&#8217;s technologies, there&#8217;s like a stack in the browser where you can make things. It was just such a&#8230; I look back at that time fondly, but also in hindsight, there was a lot going on.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t think&#8230; for me, I wasn&#8217;t aware of it at the time. I was just like, oh, okay. This is cool. Oh, this is&#8230; Okay, cool. This is cool. That&#8217;s cool. I even look at&#8230; I use Photoshop a lot, for example, and I look at Photoshop from back then to now and how much I can do that I really couldn&#8217;t do without having to download a plugin or something. And the same thing with everything in the Adobe Suite. I was using Premiere for a while and I just couldn&#8217;t, didn&#8217;t jive with me. So even now transitioning over to Da Vinci Resolve has been like, my head explodes every time I use it. So it&#8217;s so phenomenal. And it doesn&#8217;t bog down my CPU. I don&#8217;t have to open up a whole nother program to do as much. I can do it all in here. I can do audio the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
This is awesome. For 300 bucks, I don&#8217;t have to do a subscription, a yearly subscription. I [inaudible 00:34:48] with it. So I&#8217;m just really thankful for it. I love technology, so I&#8217;m thankful for technology. I&#8217;m kind of a computer nerd. I was as a kid, backtracking real quick, I used to write programs on the old&#8230; Gosh, it wasn&#8217;t an IBM computer. It was a Commodore.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, the Commodore 64?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. Definitely showing our age. Because that one [inaudible 00:35:12]. Yeah, I&#8217;d go to the library and rent and take out these coding books and you&#8217;d spend three hours writing code just to make the colors on the screen. And that was fascinating to me. Just learning syntax. And anyway, so it helped me, even in corporate. When I was working in corporate, I had to&#8230; The company I was working for, it was a proprietary voiceover IP network, one of the first in the country. So I would have to be able to trace a call from London to California, and I could literally look at the numbers on the screen and see the nodes as the signal is&#8230; Well, the communication is traveling and seeing where it breaks. And that always remind me of when I was a kid. Wow, this looks just like when I was programming my Commodore 64. But yeah, I&#8217;m just nerding out a little bit on the tech. But it&#8217;s a great timing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it was. Even visually with&#8230; Flash was just everywhere. Flash was such a huge component of creating experiences online. And now in 2023, really years prior to that, I&#8217;d say probably as early as maybe 2020 or so, Flash is just a distant memory.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
During that transitional phase when I was going to school, I actually gig doing graphic design and marketing for a local recording studio. And I had to do Flash. And I was like, what the hell is this? I&#8217;d never really had much experience with Flash and I thought it was kind of an antiquated technology, even back then. But they insisted on using it for their banner ads and whatever. But me being at that job was also a big turning point for me because of just where I was. And then being around musicians and kind of transitioning into connecting with artists who needed photography and design. You know what I mean? So yeah, that was a good time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s bring it back to your studio, then. So you had that spark to start your studio then after doing that photography gig, you&#8217;ve kept it going now for 15 years, and your client list is extremely impressive. Just some of a few, I&#8217;ll name off here. Moleskine, which are the notebooks, the Italian leather notebooks, Apple Music, Spike Lee. And of course, musicians, The Foreign Exchange. They&#8217;re one of my absolute favorite groups. I&#8217;ve been a fan since Connected. I&#8217;ve been such a fan. This is complete fanboy moment at this point. How did you get involved with them?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of a funny story. So back in late 2009, I was kind of slowly making a name for myself as a photographer. I&#8217;m a music nerd, and I was dating someone at the time, time who knew Phonte.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Actually, I think they dated years before she and I met. But anyway I was also on&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if you remember the Okayplayer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, I remember them.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I was on Okayplayer, and I go into the, what do they call it, the rooms or whatever, the chat rooms, I guess, and just nerd out on music. And at the time that&#8217;s pretty much how the product exchange met on Okayplayer. And they recorded their whole album by just sending tracks and vocals across the ocean, because Nicolay was in the Netherlands at the time, living there. So anyway, so it was cool being able to connect with these artists like Little Brother and Questlove, and kind of just being involved in conversations and casts happen about music. And the person I was dating at the time would randomly post my photography into the forums. Like hey, my boyfriend did this picture, blah, blah, blah. And apparently Phonte was paying attention. So one winter, like I said, I think late 2009, we went to a gig.</p>
<p>It was a Red Bull event, and it was a battle of the bands featuring The Foreign Exchange and a punk rock band. And it was brilliant because what they had to do was play each other&#8217;s music and interpreted however they saw fit based off of the genre. Right? So it was cool hearing The Foreign Exchange&#8217;s band, which was amazing, playing these compositions that the punk rock band made. And then vice versa, you know what I mean? Really good time. Of course, I brought my camera, took some really cool photos of the bands. And then as we were leaving, I hear someone calling me and it&#8217;s Phonte. He and I had never met, but he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey man, you Chris Charles? I saw you coming you up here. We got a new album coming out, man.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Word? Okay. Hit me up, man.&#8221; And that was it. That was the beginning of that relationship. I just loved the process. So I worked with almost all the artists under the, not just The Foreign Exchange, but their record label.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So Median when he was on the label, just finished working with, well last year, last summer. BeMyFiasco, who is Phonte&#8217;s prot√©g√©, musically. And yeah, pretty much have done every project after Leave It All Behind.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So did all the photography, the design. Think the first one was Love in Flying Colors. That was the one. And yeah, did all the pre-flight, the layout, the photography, excuse me, and then yeah, all the way up to their last one. So it&#8217;s been a great journey with those guys. And we just did a photo shoot a few months ago, actually. Because they have some things that they&#8217;re going to be doing here. So it was good reconnecting with those guys again. But yeah, it was just, once again, those types of circumstances that the relationship building aspect of it is what&#8217;s important. And we&#8217;ve always had a great relationship. Really great guys. So yeah, those guys are cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m trying to think how I first found out&#8230; I think I found out about Foreign Exchange either through&#8230; It was one or two ways. One, there&#8217;s a music store here in Atlanta called Moods Music.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, I know it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Darryl.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a hot spot, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s the spot. That&#8217;s the spot. I&#8217;m gatekeeping a little bit now that I&#8217;ve told the whole world on the podcast, but that&#8217;s the spot though. That&#8217;s the hot music spot in Atlanta. But I either found out about them. It was either through there or through this website that a couple of friends of mine founded called SoulBounce. I can&#8217;t remember if it was through one of the two. It was one of those two that I remember first hearing about it, because like I said, I&#8217;ve been listening. I&#8217;ve been a fan since Connected. Leave It All Behind, still gets rotation in this house to this day. &#8220;House of Cards,&#8221; oh my god, love that group. And even all the other stuff that Phonte did. I know Phonte and Zo! did this &#8217;80s cover album. That was really good.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It was Percy Miracle, and I forget the other name. But yeah, Phonte had the Jerry Curl wig on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, they did Stepping Out. They did Africa from Toto. Yeah. That was&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Those guys are so talented, man. Even now with&#8230; What&#8217;s that show? I know Zo! and Phonte been writing a lot for this new kind of musical skit comedy show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, is it Sherman&#8217;s Showcase?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Sherman&#8217;s Showcase, yes. And then of course, I designed the Eric Robeson Phonte record, Tigallerro. I did Phonte&#8217;s last single. Any visuals that came out pretty much revolving around the phone exchange or Nicolay&#8217;s or Phonte individual projects, I also had the privilege of working on. So, such a good time, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, man. I think of all that. You mentioned Eric Roberson and now I&#8217;m thinking of all the soul music that was also just kind of in and around during that time. That was such a&#8230; When I think on that time, that was late 2000s early 2010s. That was such, for me, that was just such a pivotal time. I think I was just turning 30 right around then, too. I was like, oh man. Such good music. And that&#8217;s so cool that you were just a part of all of that. And you get to work on it all. Do all that stuff.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It&#8217;s still surreal. It&#8217;s still surreal. Whenever I see&#8230; When President Obama had one of their songs on his yearly playlist, I&#8217;m like, what? I&#8217;m looking at a photograph and design I did and now President Obama saw that, word? I mean, that&#8217;s cool. It&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Can you give me a sneak peek on whether or not they have a new album coming out?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I&#8217;m sworn to secrecy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. All right.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s just say we did a&#8230;.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You mentioned a photo shoot, I thought I would ask.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m sorry, that&#8217;s all I can say. But yeah, stay tuned, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;re talking about Foreign Exchange and Phonte too, but Nicolay is super talented as producer. I have some of his solo albums, too. One of them&#8230; I forget what it&#8217;s called. Something with Shibuya in it, I&#8217;m not remembering&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, no. The City Lights. City Lights Volume II. Oh man. That&#8217;s one of my favorite, favorite just chill out albums. One of the songs on there is&#8230; I forget the&#8230; I have to go back and remember the name. Because I know the song when I hear it, I can&#8217;t necessarily think of the name of it, but it&#8217;s like some song. I don&#8217;t know. I call it my getting home from the club song. When you get home super late and the sun&#8217;s about to Rise, it&#8217;s like that kind of song.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I forget the name of it. But they&#8217;re all super talented. That whole clique is super talented</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
And super nice. Whenever I get to catch up with Nicolay. The guy&#8217;s really, really smart. He has a degree in musicology. He&#8217;s not just like self-taught. He&#8217;s really formally trained, but also humble and tall. The guy&#8217;s like seven feet tall. He&#8217;s like about six foot seven. He&#8217;s huge. But just the nicest guy. Same thing with City of Lights Volume too. Those guys are always gracious whenever we connect. What&#8217;s another one I did? Not the Shibuya one. I did the next one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Soweto.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yes. I did the graphics for that one as well, as well for [inaudible 00:45:08].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been lucky, man. I&#8217;ve been lucky.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you do to stay motivated and productive with your work?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Just constantly evolving, actually, as far as what I do. For me, sometimes it&#8217;s just if I&#8217;m editing photos, I run into a creative block with where to go with a certain edit. I&#8217;ll put it down and I&#8217;ll step away and indulge in another media, be it a short film or looking at some art books that I have. But I know for me, staying inspired revolved around kind of exploring the balance between what&#8217;s in my head and what I see that catches my eye out in the world. And also music. A lot of my photography and design, I feel it&#8217;s so connected to musical energy. And at least to me, I always like to think of a song whenever I present a certain edit or if I do a print.</p>
<p>So for me, sometimes I&#8217;ll be inspired by music, or if I&#8217;m producing music and coming up with a theme and a rhythm, and I&#8217;ll start to see colors and I&#8217;ll start to say, oh, okay, maybe I think that&#8217;s rare. Then I go back to the edit and it&#8217;s like yeah, I add that touch of red to it. So, it varies. But mostly I&#8217;d say music and using contrasting mediums to kind of offset each other. So if I&#8217;m doing design, I&#8217;ll stop and do some photography or look at photography. If I&#8217;m doing photography, I&#8217;ll listen to music. It&#8217;s weird. I kind of traverse these different medium when I need inspiration from something else, from another place. So yeah, that&#8217;s one of the ways I use medium.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say your artistic style has evolved over the years?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
When I first started doing photography, especially when I was in design school, I was implementing design elements within my photography a lot. And it was just how I saw things. I would do a portrait and find a creative way to add text to it or add texture to it using overlays. I think as I&#8217;ve evolved as an artist, I think my style has&#8230; It&#8217;s gotten a lot simpler. So I&#8217;ve simplified it. I&#8217;ve been able to deconstruct it in a way that there might be some texture, or I&#8217;ll just use a textured backdrop or a textured setting, versus actually adding the texture in post.</p>
<p>But also just kind of continuing to try to master fighting in the technical aspects of photography. And then getting into filmmaking and learning that technology and learning how to edit and just being a one-stop shop. Because I just love all those mediums, so why not learn how to do them? And then eventually that became another aspect of my business. So I think expanding, going from this photography, to design and photography, to dabbling in web design. And then, oh, short films, and then doing promo spots for clients and doing commercials for schools and things of that nature. So yeah, learning new technology is pretty much how I think I&#8217;ll be evolved over the years, specifically</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Overall, is there a piece of art or a specific project or something that you&#8217;ve done that you&#8217;re particularly proud of? Like the crown jewel in your portfolio, or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
There are a couple, actually. I think most recently I got commissioned by a really amazing local candle making company, Black-owned, to design a signature candle to be distributed through the NBA, the NBA 75th Anniversary candle series. And they gave me full autonomy to design it within the specs of the candle. And with that, I was given access to seeing what the candle kind of smelled like, and taking hints from the notes of the candle and then implementing that into the design. That to me was very exciting, very exciting. And for that to be connected to the NBA was just mind-blowing. I&#8217;d say another one is probably the Spike Lee project that between&#8230; It was joint project between Spike Lee and Moleskine where they were doing these cheap, got-to-have-it books, Moleskine books. So that&#8217;s where that connection happened.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh!</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I was able to connect with Spike Lee and his team and come up with a&#8230; I had to shoot a short film of a local artist, a Black woman artist who embodied the whole image, the vibe of Nola Darling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nola Darling, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It was cool because Spike Lee, huge inspiration for me. One of my favorite movies is near all of them, but I say from an aesthetic standpoint, [inaudible 00:49:37] blues, the way he used colors and contrasting colors to point out personality differences, and music and jazz. I think another fun time was shooting Martin Lawrence and his daughters&#8217; graduation party. And that was interesting and totally random. One of actually, it so happened that his daughter, her hairdresser was my client. They needed a photographer. And she graduated from Duke University. And I&#8217;ll never forget this, this was Mother&#8217;s Day a few years ago. And I remember going to brunch with my mom and then having to leave and drive to Duke University to their private banquet thing, golf club. And I&#8217;m looking at Martin Lawrence and his family. Oh, and Emmett Smith. Because they&#8217;re all connected. Emmett Smith, who&#8217;s one of my favorite running backs of all times for the NFL is Martin&#8217;s ex-wife&#8217;s new husband.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m looking at Martin Lawrence and his family, the kids, Emmett Smith, and I&#8217;m just there to take pictures and you&#8217;re paying me to do this. Are you kidding me? It&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s living the dream. So yeah, I&#8217;ve had some really amazing&#8230; Gosh, I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s times like these, and I&#8217;m thankful for you to these great questions because it really makes me think about&#8230; For one, if there was any time where I didn&#8217;t, or if any people didn&#8217;t respect the craft of image-making, be it photography or design, and the times that I&#8217;ve doubted it as well. Like oh yeah, people don&#8217;t take this stuff seriously. But then one day I&#8217;m in Venice Italy, because I was commissioned to be there by a client. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s like, wow, I said that but I&#8217;m actually overseas right now, and my whole job is to just be cool and take fly pictures. So yeah, I&#8217;ve had a few instances of really amazing experiences and being in rooms and work and opportunities. So yeah, I have a few, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying, I just can&#8217;t pick one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think once again, all of that really speaks to the power of relationships.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It really speaks to being able to know who, not just know who certain people are, but to maintain those relationships enough where people are advocates or sponsors for you in places where you&#8217;re not available. Especially with what you just mentioned with shooting Martin Lawrence&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s graduation, like you said her hairdresser is one of your clients, and so that&#8217;s how that all happened. They could have picked any photographer. Martin&#8217;s a celebrity. They could have picked any photographer.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
What&#8217;s so funny about that, she just called me randomly and she was like, &#8220;Hey, I got a gig for you. Just say yes.&#8221; I was like, what? She wouldn&#8217;t tell me who it was until the day before. She was like, oh, by the way, this is the Lawrence family and Smith family. Like, &#8220;Lawrence who?&#8221; [inaudible 00:52:29] I was like, oh, okay. Yeah. Relationships, knowing people and doing good work in this treating well manner.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And the Spike Lee Moleskine, I have the Spike Lee Moleskine. It&#8217;s still in the plastic. I refuse to open it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Oh, nice. Yeah, that&#8217;s definitely a collectors&#8217; item. Definitely a collectors&#8217; item.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve had a few people on the show that have done work with Spike, either presently or in the past and stuff. It&#8217;s amazing how he pulls in other Black designers to work on his projects, whether it&#8217;s like Art Sims doing projects, whether it&#8217;s you on this notebook project. I think most recently he did some work with this black typographer I had on the show, Tre Seals for his book, like design the font for the book and everything. Spike is really good about pulling in other Black creatives into his work, which I really appreciate that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
And I honestly believe, I think it should be like that. It&#8217;s always great to see and I always appreciate it. But how else are we going to continue to spread and learn about each other&#8217;s talents without actually giving each other shots and [inaudible 00:53:34] opportunities?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I love to see it. Love to see it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice do you have for aspiring creative directors or artists out there, particularly those that want to be self-employed like you are and be able to kind of forge their own path?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;d say do your homework. And when I say that it&#8217;s great to go out with passion and present it, but you have to have a plan. And that could be, do you want to be a generalist? This could be applied to a couple of different mediums, of course. But yeah, do I want to be a specialist? Do I want to be a generalist? I&#8217;ve gone back and forth between that as well. For me, it&#8217;s about also diversifying, right? I don&#8217;t just solely rely on photography or I don&#8217;t just solely rely on consulting or design, or filmmaking. It&#8217;s about building a brand based on those three words. Like I said, style, creativity, and soul. And thinking about how you want your clients to feel when they work with you and after they&#8217;re done working with you, and will that make them want to work with you again? So it&#8217;s like a lot of soft skill stuff. I mean, of course, being technically skilled and talented, those are all great things, but if people don&#8217;t like you, you&#8217;re not going to go very far.</p>
<p>So I think learning how to maintain or establish and maintain relationships with people who align with the vision that you want to sell your artwork to, present your work to, and being able to manage that and navigate that and be in spaces and present yourself well, I think that&#8217;s really important. And then also, of course, the more technical stuff about managing business, establishing an LLC, your contracts, delivering, over-delivering at times, under-promising versus the vice versa. Because people will call you out. You said we were going to get 30 pictures, you only delivered 29. It&#8217;s like, oh, okay. Gotcha. But if I say I&#8217;m delivering 15 and I deliver 30, guess what? Now I&#8217;m a rockstar. And a lot of creatives take that for granted. And I also understand that there&#8217;s time and money involved with creating and running a business. So be mindful of that. Don&#8217;t kill yourself. Rest. Take your time to step away from it and reevaluate, reassess, learn, and then ask for mentorship from people who are already doing it that are in the game.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing, like future stuff or continuation of what you&#8217;re currently on? Where do you see yourself?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, ultimately five years&#8230; It&#8217;s funny because I&#8217;ve been actually writing out my tenure plan. And in the next five years, couple things. I definitely want to have a new physical space to run a shop and have a team, a dedicated team on payroll to where I can manage and be lead creative or a principal for projects that are being done by people that are working for me. But also, I have a really big passion for veterans&#8217; affairs. So I&#8217;ve been researching ways that I can somehow participate in helping veterans, be it they&#8217;re transitioning or trying to find their way out in the workforce. Or if they&#8217;re trying to start a business, there are so many benefits out there available to veterans who they don&#8217;t know they&#8217;re there and they&#8217;re just out here flapping and trying to work, but also might have some disabilities or issues that their workplace or workplaces are required to accommodate. So yeah, that&#8217;s a huge passion of mine honestly, in helping veterans, especially veterans of color, transition and live good lives after having lived through some really potentially horrible situations because of war. But yeah, having a shop and helping veterans.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Sure. So my main website is chrischarles.co. That&#8217;s chrischarles.co, not dot-com. The person who owns that domain name refuses to give it up, so I&#8217;m stuck with the dot-co and that&#8217;s no problem. That&#8217;s fine. So that has pretty much leads you to all of the other work that I do. I have a separate photography website, which you can also find once you go to chrischarles.co. But for people who are specifically interested in photography, it&#8217;s my full name, christophercharlesphotography.com. I have a Facebook business page, it&#8217;s Chris Charles Photo. My Instagram handle is the_chrischarles, so the, underscore symbol, Chris Charles. Those are the main places to find me. I&#8217;m there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Sounds good. Well Chris Charles, I want to thank you so much for coming on this show. I think certainly everything that you have talked about speaks to two key things that I think folks should kind of take in mind, particularly as we go into the new year. One is about being adaptable, and the second is about building relationships. I think everything that you&#8217;ve described about your career to date has been a testament to both of those abilities, and you&#8217;ve been able to craft and use both of those to be able to build a career for yourself, build a life for yourself, and continue to do great work out there in the community. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me, man. This is really fun. Enjoyed talking with you, Maurice. And yeah, anything you need from me, just let me know.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of drive and determination to chart your own course, and no one embodies those qualities better than this week&#8217;s guest. As the creative director (and founder) of <a href="https://curvetheory.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Curve Theory</a>, Reggie Tidwell has provided beautiful and effective design, branding, photography, and videography work to clients for over 20 years. </p>
<p>We talked about the secret to Reggie&#8217;s longevity as a creative entrepreneur, and he shared his story about growing up in St. Louis, studying graphic design, and his early post-grad career as a Flash designer in the beginning days of the World Wide Web. Reggie also spoke about what brought him to North Carolina, and about his work in bringing an AIGA chapter to Asheville.

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Hey, I&#8217;m Reggie Tidwell and I am a graphic designer and a professional photographer as well as a videographer, which I do on occasion as well. I tell stories.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Wow, it has been a great year. Bought a house.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Thank you. I also have had my best financial career last year. Everything has culminated to that, and this year seems to be on track to even beat that, so that&#8217;s super exciting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, that&#8217;s real good. That&#8217;s real good. I mean, even with all of that, is there anything in particular that you want to try to accomplish before the year ends?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, once you own a house, there&#8217;s always house stuff that you want to accomplish, but professionally, man, things have just been falling into place and sort of a beautiful way that I feel just very excited. I&#8217;m going to be doing all of the photography for&#8230; So I&#8217;m a huge fan of the outdoors and nature landscape photography. I do a lot of that for Explore Asheville, which is our big tourism division here in Asheville, and the Gray Smoking Mountain Association has reached out and they&#8217;re going to have me do all the photography for their new book on Cade&#8217;s Cove, which is a really beautiful spot in the Smokies. So if you&#8217;ve ever been to Great Smokey Mountain National Park, it&#8217;s our biggest and most visited national park in the country and it&#8217;s absolutely gorgeous. But I&#8217;m super excited. I&#8217;m going to be doing all the photos for the book, so I&#8217;ll get a book cred.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. Congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about your company Curve Theory. Now, Curve Theory has been around for over 20 years, which I definitely have to tip my hat to you. I ran a studio for nine years and I know how much goes into that. So 20, over 20 years, I think. What, 21 now, right?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
21 years. 21. I&#8217;m in my 21st year. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What&#8217;s been the key to your longevity?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Quite honestly, it&#8217;s building relationships. I&#8217;ve never advertised. It really is a combination of building relationships and being passionate about the work that I do. I love designing photography, I love being a creative, I love people. And so it just makes sense that I would be able to maintain this business because it&#8217;s all the things that I love and things that I would be doing anyway. I&#8217;m always building relationships. I always tell people, and I always think it&#8217;s a funny little bit of a factoid about me. I don&#8217;t typically just add people on Facebook that I don&#8217;t know, and I&#8217;ve got 3000 plus connections on Facebook and every single one of them is someone that I know. I had either a meaningful conversation with and align somewhere, or they&#8217;re friends in real life or I served on the board with them, or whatever the case may be. They&#8217;re all real connections and when you think about that, that&#8217;s a lot of&#8230; Exponentially the more people, the sort of more you can grow your network. This business for me is really about being present and available.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s really good for Facebook. I think Facebook and probably a lot of social media networks now have really enabled this way to just collect friends, almost like you&#8217;re, I don&#8217;t know, collecting trading cards or something like that without really having any intentionality behind it. The way that you&#8217;re about connections on Facebook. That&#8217;s how I am on LinkedIn. I&#8217;m really, unless I&#8217;ve worked with you or I know you personally or something like that, we met at a conference or something, we&#8217;ve had a conversation. That&#8217;s usually the only way that I&#8217;ll add people. Although now, lately I have gotten a little lax and well, partly because I let them stack up. So I&#8217;ll go months without adding anyone on LinkedIn and all of a sudden I&#8217;ve got a hundred connections. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, I should probably go through these and see who I know.&#8221; And I tell people, write a note to let me know how we know each other. And I mean some of them are just sales calls and what have you, but&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So many of those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But in terms of the power of the network, I got laid off recently and I posted I think two posts on LinkedIn about it and I was flabbergasted by how my network showed up and spread the word and put me in connection with other people. And I&#8217;ve had some great conversations and such, so&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
That&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s this author Porter Gale who says your network is your net worth. I totally believe that. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Totally. Yeah. I get so much business from those connections on Facebook. I mean, quite honestly, it&#8217;s just doing stuff, especially from the photography side of my business. I&#8217;ll post a photo and I&#8217;m constantly posting photos and I do also on LinkedIn. Ultimately what ends up happening is because you&#8217;re constantly putting content out when someone thinks a photography and someone says, &#8220;Hey, do you know a great photographer?&#8221; You should be in someone&#8217;s very short list of their mental Rolodex. And that&#8217;s what happened. I get calls all the time. Hey, so and so&#8230; I mentioned on Facebook that I was looking for a drone photographer or a lifestyle photographer, a commercial photographer, whatever, and they mention you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What&#8217;s a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So for me, it&#8217;s nice being a designer and a photographer because on any given day, I never know it could bring me being out in a field on a photo shoot, it could bring me in a brand strategy session with a client, or a discovery session with a new branding client, whatever it is. It&#8217;s nice because my days aren&#8217;t always the same. I get to travel, I get to, for instance tomorrow I&#8217;m going to be in another area of North Carolina for a commercial shoot for pretty much much of the day, starting at Golden Color. And it&#8217;s nice. And then Friday I&#8217;m in the studio all day, probably editing photos from that shoot and rounding out a logo for another client.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you include your photography as part of your design service, so I guess company services, I should say?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Kind of. Occasionally the two will intertwine, usually the two intertwine when I&#8217;m doing web designing. So if I&#8217;m designing a website for a client, a lot of times because I know exactly what kind of images the client needs, I can add it as part of my service to do a lifestyle shoot of their company or their clientele, and then that can get baked into their website. And I&#8217;m working with my own images. I can control a lot more effort that way. But yeah, it happens. It doesn&#8217;t happen as much because I don&#8217;t do as much web design as I used to. I&#8217;m probably doing about two or three sites a year where I used to do quite a bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Back when I had my studio, I wound things down from the design end, I&#8217;d say roughly around in the mid 2010s because there was certainly a market for bespoke web design. They want, people wanted a particular website theme or something like that. But now with all these website builders out here, people are taking the design element, or at least the modular parts or the design process into their own hands. And it&#8217;s like, yeah, I don&#8217;t really need bespoke anymore. And so I ended up doing more consulting because you were able to shift like that. So it&#8217;s interesting now because I&#8217;m looking for work at the moment and people are like, &#8220;Oh, okay, you redesign a website?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, Ah. I mean I haven&#8217;t done it in a long time maybe.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I&#8217;m probably not your first choice for that, but I get what you mean. People, they hear design and of course if you have an online presence and a website, that&#8217;s the first thing they think about is, &#8220;Oh, can you design a website or can you redesign a website?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
I think depending on the client, I do still see value in bespoke. I feel like ultimately I&#8217;ll end up doing a completely custom website where I&#8217;ll get to work with a developer and I&#8217;ll design the front end and we can work beautifully and make something really amazing. But that doesn&#8217;t happen as often as I would like. But I do find the builders have actually worked for me because especially if you know them, there&#8217;s Divi and Elementor, there&#8217;s a handful of other ones I&#8217;ve been using Divi for a while, and though it can be a little bit verbose in it&#8217;s code, I find that the flexibility of me being able to do something completely custom using mostly you doing custom CSS to some of their built in modules.<br>
So I can build the content and lay out the content really quickly, then go in with CSS and really start to fine tune and make it exactly what I want it to be. That&#8217;s a nice, because I do work with very large clients and also small clients, that&#8217;s a really nice option for clients that don&#8217;t have six to 10 grand in their pocket to do a website. It&#8217;s just nice to have that as an option and for them to still get something that&#8217;s custom.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of which, what are the best types of clients for you to work with?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Quite honestly, I&#8217;ve got a soft spot for the mom and pop shops, either they&#8217;re startups or they&#8217;ve been around for a while and it&#8217;s time to change things up. I love that transition of being able to help them renew their own passion in their business through that process. I&#8217;m working on the branding right now for an auction house that&#8217;s been around for decades. They&#8217;ve been on Antique Roadshow, so they&#8217;ve got a presence, but their brand look is a bit dated and they&#8217;ve started resting on their laurels a little bit because everything is just so tried and true. It is what it is. It&#8217;s been what it&#8217;s been. And they realize this time to shake things up a little bit. They want to expand their market a little bit, they want to&#8230; And so going through that process with them, it&#8217;s so rewarding because they&#8217;ve been living with the same logo for 20 years, or longer.<br>
And to be able to see them embrace something that&#8217;s different, and it&#8217;s a fun process too with this particular client because they were like, &#8220;Yeah, we want some completely modern and avant garde.&#8221; And I went there, they were like, &#8220;Oh no. We love it, but we&#8217;re not ready yet.&#8221; And so, okay, that&#8217;s good. At least I know what your comfort level is. And so now I can dial it back and land exactly where we need to be. And then feeling them working through the resistance but then initially, not only acceptance, but oh my God, this is amazing. This is going to be really great for our company. We&#8217;re excited. That&#8217;s a great feeling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So when a project, let&#8217;s say, comes in your inbox or something like that, what does your process look like when it comes to starting on new work?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So I usually have a quick little meeting with the client just qualify whether or not we&#8217;re going to work well together and whether I&#8217;m the guy for the job. But then once that decision is made, I set up a discovery session where we really actually start to dig deep into the typical discovery questionnaire where you learn a little bit more about their business, their aspirations, what&#8217;s working, what&#8217;s not working, so I can better provide exactly what they&#8217;re looking for. I feel like, for me anyway, I feel like the key to being a good designer that makes happy clients and solves the right problems or solves problems in the right way is asking the right questions at the very beginning. So I&#8217;m all about being inquisitive. I want to know everything. And if you feel like it&#8217;s too much, it&#8217;s not.<br>
Because at the end of the day when I&#8217;m digging into sketching out logo concepts or I&#8217;m coming up with a tagline or whatever that information that I&#8217;m going to be so thankful that I have it because I can go through and dig in for inspiration to recheck the direction that I&#8217;m going to make sure I&#8217;m headed in the right way. But yeah, it&#8217;s all about the Q and A, at the beginning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I see here on your website that you do a lot of volunteer work. You worked also with Leaf Community Arts. Can you talk to me a little bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. So, Leaf Community Arts for me was a big part of, I did service work before that, but it probably to date was probably one of the biggest chapters in my life in terms of giving back. Leaf Community Arts is a nonprofit here in the Asheville area that they have teaching artists that go into the public school system and the neighborhood centers and basically recreation centers and they work with youth, teaching them poetry, dance, how to play the Djembe, how to do different types of art, visual art. It&#8217;s pretty amazing. And it gives kids this sense of ownership of something which I think is quite necessary, especially for the age range of students that they work with. But then they also have this other part that I was actually more aligned with was they do cultural preservation in First Nations, third world countries like [inaudible 00:16:38], and Uganda, and Rwanda, and Cuba, all these different places where there are cultures that have been around for ages and First Nations tribes that as the youth are becoming more westernized and the elders are dying off, these cultures are just vanishing.<br>
There&#8217;s no evidence of their songs, or instrument making, or costumes, or any of it. And so what Leaf Community Arts did what they were partnering with an agency on the ground that was trying to do that cultural preservation and help raise money to do things like build recording studios, or hire artisans that know the native language to native songs, the instrument making, the dances. And they actually make it really cool for the youth where they&#8217;re putting their phones down, and totally engaging, and dancing, and singing. And I found that particularly interesting. I love the beauty of cultures, and how different cultures are, and how you can learn something completely and different from a culture that you never had experienced before.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now are you still doing work with them? I know that now you&#8217;re also the new president of AIGA Asheville, the founding president, but have you waned your work with Leaf Community Arts?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
I have still a supporter of it. I worked all the way up to my presidency in 2017 and then my term ended. So I&#8217;m now board president emeritus. I&#8217;m still, the Leaf Community Arts people are family, they actually put on a huge music festival three times a year. I&#8217;ve met Arrested Development, Speech. Now we know each other by name. I&#8217;ve met, gosh, we&#8217;ve had Angelique Kidjo, and Mavis Staples, and Indigo Girls, and all these amazing bands that have come played. The Family Stone. But they put on this music festival in the spring and in the fall and this really beautiful place out in Black Mountain called, Black Mountain, North Carolina, called Lake Eden. And then they do one in downtown Asheville in the summer. And that basically raises money for all of the work that I mentioned before that they do with cultures and with the youth.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. Nice. And we&#8217;ll talk more about your AIGA Asheville work a little bit later on in the interview. With everything that you do through Curve Theory, what gets you truly excited about your work?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Man, I love to solve problems. Quite honestly. I love working with clients and trying to find out exactly what&#8217;s not working with them and helping come up with solutions that one, inspire and excite them. But then also they continue to propel me forward in my love of the work that I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now let&#8217;s dive a little bit into your personal story. You talk about this I think a bit on your website, but you grew up in St. Louis. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Born and raised?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So I grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. I was raised mostly by my grandmother, an amazing dad too, that was also in the picture. But most of my time was spent with my grandmother, who was an educator. She taught for 36 years and she was a huge supporter of education. And so in the summers where all my friends were out playing and running around, I had to do homework before I could go out and join them.<br>
And of course I hated it then, but on some level I understood the importance of it and it would come into play in many periods throughout my life, just being someone that is studious. I ended up testing the highest in the seventh grade in language and math in the entire school that I was in seventh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
In seventh grade. Which that said a lot about my grandmother&#8217;s dedication and how she worked it with me, but it wasn&#8217;t with a heavy hand. She just understood that she wanted me&#8230; I grew up in a very, I would say mean, just put it bluntly. It was a poor neighborhood, lot of gang violence, a lot of break-ins and theft. And I saw some pretty horrific things in my own neighborhood, just in my own alley. It wasn&#8217;t a place that I wanted to definitely grow up and grow old.<br>
And so education for me was the key of being able to get to a more ideal situation. So I wouldn&#8217;t say I was a first generation college student. My mother had a degree music, actually two. She had wanted music and art, possibly three maybe in education. But my grandmother, of course was educated. And so it set me on my path to discover who I really wanted to be in the world. I think you had mentioned very briefly what was it that made me choose this path of design? But all that didn&#8217;t come quite easily.<br>
I ended up pretty much blowing away my first couple years in St. Louis at a junior college called Florissant Valley. I think I had a 1.9 GPA because I wasn&#8217;t inspired. I picked business administration because I knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur. But you&#8217;re asking a 18 year old, 17 year old, 18 year old kid to decide what they want to do for the rest of their life. And yeah, of course I want to run a business. Oh yeah, business administration, that&#8217;s what you should do. But that&#8217;s such a broad topic. I wasn&#8217;t inspired.<br>
I actually went from that student, at one point I was the student in the back of the class nodding off, not very inspired. The teacher would call on me and not only did I not know the answer to the question, I wouldn&#8217;t even know what the question was because I was probably asleep. So I ended up taking a break after four semesters of that, I said I got to do better. This isn&#8217;t going the way I wanted to go. So I ended up taking a semester off and really doing some deep diving and soul searching. I talked to my counselor at the school. I really thought long and heavy about what I liked and the things that I knew I liked were being creative. I was always drawing from the time I could hold a pencil, I was sketching and doodling. And so I always loved art. My mom was an artist, is an artist. And so that was an inspiration.<br>
And so I went back to school. I decided at the time that I wanted to be an interior designer or a architect. And the path to both of those were mechanical drawing and a lot of drafting. And so that was all I needed to be inspired. I went from that student that I mentioned before to the student making the top score on every test in every class until I graduated. I went from a 1.9 GPA to a 3.2 GPA, graduated with honors and got my general transfer studies to go on to a four year college.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know there&#8217;s that saying that goes, sometimes you have to do things that you don&#8217;t necessarily want to do to try to get to do the things that you do want to do. But I think also to that end, just from what you&#8217;re mentioning, that whole period of high school going into college, there&#8217;s so much pressure to try to decide exactly what it is you&#8217;re going to do. And I mean we also, I think have to put this in the context of just where the world was at this time. Because I&#8217;m guessing this is around early nineties. Early nineties.<br>
And there was just this push, and I was mean I was in elementary school then, but I mean still there was this push to know exactly what it is that you&#8217;re going to do with your life at fairly early age. Look at the state of the world with what&#8217;s going on, what is it that you want to do? And for a lot of people it&#8217;s tough. I mean, even when I started out in college, I ended up switching majors because I thought I wanted to do one thing just based on societal norms and such. And then I was like, eh, I don&#8217;t really like it.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
I know. That&#8217;s a big part of it. I mean, thinking about it nowadays students take what they call a gap year. I am a firm supporter of that because I do feel like somebody that young needs to go out into the world a little bit and understand who they are. I mean, up to that point, they&#8217;ve just been a student studying all the basic electives. There&#8217;s nothing in that that would potentially produce career inspirations. Maybe you like math and maybe you like biology, but that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you want to be a mathematician, or a scientist, or a biologist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So yeah, I feel like that would&#8217;ve served me well. But thankfully I was able to make that comeback and find that inspiration.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You ended up going to Maryville, University of St. Louis and there you studied graphic design. Talk to me about that time.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So yeah, actually Maurice, I started, remember I said I was interested in just interior design or architecture. That&#8217;s what got me to Maryville because they actually had a nice interior design program. And I got there in those first two years I thrived. I was still inspired and I was still being a great student and loving the experience. But at one point I got, so the way Maryville&#8217;s program was set up at the time was you did all your art electives and got all those out of the way, and your art electives as well. You got those out of the way the first two years and then you dove into your concentration.<br>
Right as I was about to make that transition, I talked to my counselor, Nancy Rice, at the time and I was like, I don&#8217;t know if I want to do interior design. I like the sketching part, I like the conceptualizing, but then it&#8217;s all floor plans and elevations and it gets super technical and that&#8217;s the part that&#8217;s where I get lost. And this particular teacher who, it is funny because I&#8217;ll tell you this in a second. She basically told me, Reggie, you&#8217;re great at computers. You love computers. I&#8217;ve been working on computers since I was 15. My grandmother bought me a Commodore 64 and I was programming in basic, I was playing games. I became very comfortable in that computer world. The nerd, the invention of the nerd. I took that as a compliment. She&#8217;s like, yeah, you&#8217;re big in the computers. And then she said, and you also love art, so you should consider graphic design.<br>
And for me that was a new term. I hadn&#8217;t thought about it. And once I did the exploration and thought about it and understood what graphic design was and understood that I&#8217;d already seen it all around me all the time already and thought about how I could be someone contributing to that. Yeah, I was like, you&#8217;re exactly right. This is exactly what I want to do. And that&#8217;s where it started. I feel, I feel really fortunate that I&#8217;m someone who got a degree in something that I&#8217;m actually still doing.<br>
I guess it was a few years ago, I reached out to her because we&#8217;re friends on Facebook. I thanked her. I didn&#8217;t remember if I&#8217;d ever thanked her, but my whole career came from that decisive moment where she told me about something I didn&#8217;t know about. And then I ran with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m trying to think, I&#8217;m trying to place this in time because we talked earlier about early nineties. So this is mid nineties or so.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So this is mid nineties. Yep. Mid nineties. Actually&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. When you said&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
&#8230;ended up graduating with my BFA in graphic design and December of &#8217;97.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Tell me what it was studying design back then, because you also have the big advent of the personal computer. You&#8217;ve got the coming of the internet as we know it. What was it studying design during that time?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Man, it was wild. I mean, first and foremost, we&#8217;re working on Apple Performs 4500s I think was the model number.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
And I mean these things were tanks and dinosaurs. You could have Photoshop open, only, or Illustrator, but not both. And if, we&#8217;re talking 32 megabytes of RAM and I mean lots of crashes, so you had to frequently save your work. We definitely did some cut and paste stuff because that was just not too far out of the rear view mirror that people were still making the migration to computer. So there was still a lot of manual cut and copy and paste, cut and paste design, lot of assemblage, a lot of that stuff was still going on. So of course it was part of our curriculum.<br>
And I&#8217;ll tap into my photography side as well. I always find it a little bit of a, for me, I paid my dues. It was a rite of passage that I actually got to do photography. I got to take photos using film and understand the value of the frame and not just take in 450 shots and hoping there&#8217;s a good one in there. And then actually developing my film in the dark room, all that stuff was happening around the same time, which all feels of course very archaic now. But that was the start. That was what it was like back then.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean it sounds like it was just really hands on because the computer couldn&#8217;t do everything. I mean, it could do some things, but you still, like you said, have to do copy and paste, or cut and paste, or you still have to take photos and develop them yourself. It&#8217;s so wild now when I think about digital cameras, because I remember in high school having Fun Saver cameras. You go to the party, you have your Fun Saver camera, you take all kind of shots, you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re going to get back until you get it back from Eckerd or wherever that you got them developed at. But yeah, and I took a photography course back then too, so I know about developing in the dark room and stuff, which now seems&#8230; It&#8217;s funny. I&#8217;ll watch a movie or something and they always paint it as this, I don&#8217;t know, old school way of doing things. Developing. And it&#8217;s not that far away from now.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
No. No. And honestly it&#8217;s become of a niche for some people. I know a lot of people that actually I say a lot, but a handful of people that are still shooting film and still developing in that handful of dark rooms that are left. And it&#8217;s something, I think maybe they embrace it, not because they&#8217;re too stubborn to switch to digital, but it&#8217;s a craft for them. Some of them are people that have embraced digital, but they also still really love film. I admire that. I think it&#8217;s great. I don&#8217;t miss it. I don&#8217;t miss the smelling the smell of fixer and then and not knowing what you&#8217;re going to get until you are dropping it into the developer and hoping that you nailed it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I could imagine even doing design back then because computers were changing and software was changing and everything. Were there trends back then? I&#8217;m just curious because I feel like a lot of stuff still carried over from print, but were there specific graphic design trends that you remember from back then?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean I think there was a time where decorative fonts were really starting to become prevalent. And you started, I mean this was quite honestly, I think this was when fonts like Hobo were actually still being used.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Oh yeah, yeah. Papyrus. Yeah, I feel like there was a exploration&#8230; Fonts just exploded. And with the advent of the computer, fonts started off trickling in and then they exploded. And I think designers had to be really disciplined to not, I feel like most designers were going really far out and using all these crazy decorative fonts and still having their design disciplines about them. So they may only use one decorative font and a nice San Serif that balanced it. But those fonts were not elegant, at all. And it of course, depending on what you were trying to do with it. And I think what has happened, we&#8217;ve seen from a time where people were trying to get away from using the tried and true fonts, the Adobe Garamond, the Futura. People were feeling like those were overused or they were too basic and so they had to expand their typeface horizons. And then I find these days, man, some of the best brands go back to basics and are going back to some of those tried and true fonts and looking for things that are a little more elegant.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I didn&#8217;t even think about the proliferation of typefaces as something that was part of design back then, but it was. I mean really because you had, of course, greater displays that were coming out and you could just do more than what you could do with print in terms of the types of typefaces. You just had different things.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
I think that was it. I think it was so many people were used to doing manual print design and then all of a sudden you&#8217;ve got access to 3000 fonts. Hold me back.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
That&#8217;s exactly what it was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you graduate from Maryville. You&#8217;re out there in the real world as a designer. What was that early postgrad career like? Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So the first thing I did, so going back to that whole wanting to be an entrepreneur thing, that still was in me. I still definitely wanted to have my own business and I started actually working with clients before I graduated. I worked at Office Depot, so I met a lot of people and there were people coming in that needed business cards, but they were really awful designs that they had or they didn&#8217;t have one at all. And I said, &#8220;Well this is what I do.&#8221; So I started developing a clientele before I even graduated and then spent the first year postgrad being an entrepreneur, working in the basement of the apartment that I lived at in at the time, it was actually a townhome, doing branding work. And it was mostly just branding and identity systems that I was doing early on. But about a year into that, being someone that&#8217;s super social, I started to get that cabin fever and wasn&#8217;t around people as much as I&#8217;d like to be.<br>
And so I had a side job working at Circuit City. On one particular day I was venting about, man, I really think I want to work in an agency or a company. And there was a guy by the name of Mike whose dad headed up a division of Lid Industries, which Lid is a Fortune 500 company and they had a division in St. Louis called PRC. The acronym got dissolved, so I don&#8217;t know what it ever originally meant, but it was in PRC. Anyway, they were hiring a resident graphic designer and at the time, you&#8217;ll appreciate this, in terms of historical relevance in the design and web design world. They had a Macromedia authorized training facility and I got the interview, got the job. They wanted me to teach Flash and Fireworks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So I ended up being the only guy in St. Louis teaching Flash through a Macromedia authorized program. And so that really just kicked off all kinds of just awesome awesomeness in my career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, I know you were in high demand back then. Cause Flash was everywhere. Everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Everywhere and everything. And that was right at the onset of its popularity. So I stayed with that company for about a year, ended up, gosh, being in a big metropolitan area, teaching Flash was awesome. So I ended up getting hired away by a information graphics company called Xplain. And I ended up being their interactive team leader. That was pretty exciting. Did that, ended up teaching at Washington University while I was there because the Art and Design faculty at Washington University wanted to learn Flash. I did a summer workshop for the Art and Design faculty. They loved it so much they invited me to create a multimedia class as part of their visual communications curriculum based on Flash and other video and other multimedia applications. And that was amazing. And I ended up partnering with a lot of design agencies in the St. Louis area, fairly large agencies because they didn&#8217;t have a web team or division.<br>
So that was cool. I ultimately got laid off from Xplain. They went through four rounds of layoffs. I went in the last round and because they still needed the work that I did, they became my first client. So that&#8217;s how I started Curve Theory in 2000, and or in 2001. It was just one of those things. I was still popular, the work was still necessary, the company was needing to make some pivots. And that was a blessing on my end because I always wanted to have my own business business. And that&#8217;s how it happened. I started, I launched Curve Theory with them as my first client 21 years ago.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I mean, I can&#8217;t think of a better way to roll into entrepreneurship like that. You were already super highly sought out for your design work in another medium. The company you&#8217;re working with goes out of business. You start your own business. That&#8217;s perfect. That&#8217;s a perfect handoff.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, it was. And they didn&#8217;t go out of business, thankfully. They did go back to their original, I think they grew to like 45 employees at one point, but they went back to the original 13 and they&#8217;re still around a day and they&#8217;re still thriving. But yeah, it&#8217;s getting kicked out of the nest but then given a nice little mattress to land on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
It was great. And I really love St. Louis, but I definitely knew that at some point I was going to want to leave St. Louis.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So what brought you to North Carolina?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So at the time, the woman that I was dating was also in that same head space that she was ready to leave St. Louis. I was still teaching in Washington University and then actually had just been encouraged by the design chair, the Art and Design faculty chair to apply for this tenure track position that was opening up in the Art and Design department. And so I was at this crossroads where in my heart I knew I really didn&#8217;t want to stay in St. Louis that much longer. Things&#8230; I had envisioned leaving St. Louis almost as soon as I graduated but things kept falling into place career wise, which was great because those things were setting me up. But at one point my partner and I, ex-partner and I, were having these frequent conversations about where we would ever relocate to and at one point I mentioned that a good buddy of mine had in passing talked about moving to North Carolina.<br>
And so I asked her, &#8220;What do you know about North Carolina?&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Oh my god, Asheville. Asheville is absolutely amazing. You would love it. Check it out.&#8221; And of course, since we had the web then, I looked it up and I mean, I think within 20 minutes I knew it&#8217;s where I wanted to be. It wasn&#8217;t landlocked. There&#8217;s a four hour drive to the ocean. Mountains, waterfalls, streams everywhere. Hiking trails, mountain bike trails, you name it. That&#8217;s the kind of guy that I was. I mean, thankfully had a father who raised me. In the time I spent with him, we would go camping and hiking. And so early on I garnered a love or appreciation of the outdoors.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so you had the job that allowed you to do this work from anywhere. So why not go to a place you really want to go?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Absolutely. I actually, I had to finish that first semester at Washington University and then I had the whole spring semester. So this was in 2023. Loved that semester, loved my students. Finished that semester, turned in my grades in May and the following weekend was Memorial Day weekend. I&#8217;d literally moved a week after I turned in my grades and never looked back.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. And you&#8217;ve been there ever since.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
And been here ever since.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. You&#8217;ve been a part of the Asheville design community now for such a long time. You mentioned your community work earlier and you&#8217;re the founding president of AIGA Asheville, a new chapter. What was behind bringing an AIGA chapter to Asheville?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a great question, Maurice. So for me, one of the things I did mention that I was on the board for the St. Louis chapter in the mix there. I think I joined the chapter while I was, might have been while I was still at Lid in PRC, but I know I did two or three years on the board as their web chair for the St. Louis chapter. And I really love that community of design, the comradery, the people that you surround yourself with understand your day to day trials and tribulations, they get it. So that was, I really appreciated that as it pertained to the design community in St. Louis. And I got to Asheville and we didn&#8217;t have that. As a matter of fact, I was trying to find designers just to connect with, just to network with and they just weren&#8217;t around.<br>
I think I had maybe three or four design friends at the time, but we knew there were more designers in and around the area, there just wasn&#8217;t anything in place to help bring them out. Out of the woodwork. And so we had a lot of early conversations about, I would reach out to these other designers that I knew in the area and tell them how much I wanted to have a chapter in Asheville, because the closest chapters were in Knoxville and Charlotte. It&#8217;s a couple hour drive each way in either direction. And so for me, just selfishly, I&#8217;m like, God, I want that here. I don&#8217;t want to drive two hours to have community. It took a while. Originally you had to have 40 sustaining members just to even be considered to have a chapter. And I think given the fact that we were having a hard time finding 20 designers in Asheville at the time, that was a tall order.<br>
So we ended up creating this thing called Design Salon, which ended up being a hang for designers in the area. And the more people gathered, the more the work got spread out, and the more designers you realized were here. The more you understood that there were some really talented people that were in Asheville. And because Asheville is such a draw for people all over the world, somebody that&#8217;s here now probably wasn&#8217;t here two weeks ago. That&#8217;s how&#8217;s how it works. There was a woman named Jamie Farris who&#8217;s also a really good friend of mine that took Design Salon and started adding programming to it, and that made it even better. And so the more program she added, the better. The more it had an actual format instead of just being a creative hangout, the more I saw that we were there, it was time.<br>
And so 2019 was when I had a feasibility meeting. I just called a bunch of people that I knew and they invited other people and I said, &#8220;Hey, I think it&#8217;s time to finally start a chapter.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t actually know the requirements had changed in my mind. I was still thinking 40 sustaining members. So half the way through, we learned that it was only 20 sustaining members, but we actually turned in our petition to become a chapter with 43 sustaining members, I think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh nice.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Just because we are a little bit of a smaller city and I wanted to show how bad we really wanted to be a chapter.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
And from that first meeting I was able to build our first board of really awesome and engaged founding board members. So yeah, we started literally the year before the pandemic and have thrived through the pandemic and we&#8217;re still kicking it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is amazing. That&#8217;s amazing to hear that. And now when you say sustaining members, is that members at a particular membership tier? Because I feel like they had that at one&#8230; I feel like sustaining was one of the, if not the top, but one of the top tiers you have to have.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, I think Design Leader was the one after that. I think the sustaining member was at the $250 giving level and then it went to Design Leader, which doubled to 500.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
And so that is, especially for a professional association, that was a lot to ask, but I was just elated that many people wanted it to and believed in us having a chapter that much that they signed up. We still have a tremendous amount of sustaining members. We probably have more sustaining members than we have in any other giving level. And they have changed the price structure and the names of the giving levels a bit. And so it&#8217;s, I think easier now than ever to join the AIGA and I feel like that was part of the reason behind just sort making it a little simpler, especially after the pandemic. But yeah, it&#8217;s quite wonderful to be in a city that now has a chapter. We have great programming. We&#8217;re putting on our first design weekend, which is a mini design week that&#8217;s coming up at the end of the month.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh. Very nice.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, first weekend of October, so it&#8217;s September 30th through October 2nd. Super excited about that. We got David Carson coming to speak at our annual meeting in November. That&#8217;s going to be pretty cool, Mr. Masterclass himself. So yeah, we&#8217;re happy to have a chapter and we&#8217;re happy to be able to have such a positive impact on our design community and that means everything for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at your career and all your experiences, is this how you imagine yourself when you were a kid in St. Louis?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
No, not at all. And it&#8217;s funny because I think being a kid in St. Louis and growing up where I grew up, I feel like my grandmother knew and saw my potential, but I didn&#8217;t see it because it&#8217;s hard. I&#8217;m surrounded by the things that I was surrounded by. And I think it&#8217;s hard to see the forest through the trees when you&#8217;re in that scenario. And for me, I don&#8217;t think, honestly, I still get surprised. I think at some point in your life, Maurice, when you&#8217;ve accomplished a lot, when you&#8217;ve done a lot, when you&#8217;ve had this longevity of experiences and learning, at some point you start to realize that people see that in you and they see all the experience and all the leadership and the guidance and they start to seek it out.<br>
I get called to be on boards, I turned down probably seven board positions last year. I&#8217;m publicly a leader. And so I think it still surprises me sometimes where, and I think it also surprises me that sometimes somebody asks me a question and I think I&#8217;m still that 25 year old in school and still on his path figuring things out, and learning, and discovering. But then I start to answer, I hear the question and then my head just gets filled with all of this relevant information that you don&#8217;t even really think about. You&#8217;re not just sitting around thinking about all the stuff, but when someone calls and asks for mentoring or it&#8217;s a colleague you&#8217;re just shooting a breeze with. You start to realize how much of that stuff is in there and it&#8217;s quite amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What gives you purpose to keep doing the work that you do now?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
I think for me it&#8217;s those relationships and experiences. I&#8217;ve always said that if I won the lottery and had all the money that I would ever need, I would still be a designer. I would still do design, I would just do mostly nonprofit work, and do it pro bono, and just take a select number of projects a year. I love the work, I&#8217;m passionate about the work, and I&#8217;m passionate about the people that I get to work with. I&#8217;m very particular about the clients. If a client doesn&#8217;t seem like they&#8217;re the right fit or I&#8217;m not going to have a mutually enjoyable experience, then I&#8217;ll pass on a project. And I&#8217;m pretty thankful to be in a place in my career where I can do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give for someone who, they&#8217;re listening to this interview, they&#8217;re hearing how you&#8217;ve come up throughout your career. What advice would you give somebody that wants to follow in your footsteps?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
I would say, and I talk to young people all the time, I actually mentor. And the thing that I feel like is the most important is to really keep exploring who you are and what you like, and don&#8217;t follow the money. I feel like it&#8217;s very easy to, I&#8217;ll talk back to a time in my life when I worked at Office Depot when I was Florissant Valley in Junior College, I was asked to get into the managerial track at Office Depot where at the time I might have made, once becoming a manager, I may have made $35,000 or $30,000, which at the time seemed like a lot of money. And that&#8217;s a very easy distraction. That&#8217;s a very easy temptation. And I had a friend at the time who also was a really, really talented artist. He also was wanting to go to design school.<br>
He ended up getting in that track and hated it. It just completely dominated his life. He wasn&#8217;t fulfilled. The money at some point wasn&#8217;t even relevant because he never had time to spend any of it because he worked so much. I turned it down because I knew, I think at this point I was already at Maryville University, so I was already in the graphic design program. I knew that that&#8217;s what I wanted to do. So in order to get to that point, you have to do some self exploration. You have to understand who you are, what it is that you really value and set your sites on being able to do that for a living. And don&#8217;t waiver.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What sort of work would you like to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Man, I would love to retire in five years. I&#8217;m 51. So that&#8217;s definitely a tall order, but in a perfect world, I might completely crush it for the next five, six years or so and retire early, or at least partially retire. But I do see myself in leadership. I do see myself still trying to bring positive change to communities in whatever way I can. Through social justice, through design leadership, through, I&#8217;ve hinted at the thought of being, it&#8217;s been mentioned and it&#8217;s been a internal conversation and conversation I&#8217;ve had with colleagues about the AIGA trajectory, and perhaps maybe serving on a national board at some point. I have friends on the national board. I love the organization and I love what the organization provides to the design community. And I always see its potential is limitless and to be able to serve in that world at a higher level, definitely. But yeah, that&#8217;s probably something that I would look to within my five year trajectory. And more than anything, I always want to make sure that the work that I&#8217;m doing continues to be meaningful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think you should definitely consider it. I mean, I&#8217;ve done work at the volunteer level, at the national level, and it&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s been great. I highly think you should do it. And I&#8217;m sure other people have probably mentioned this to you as well, but there&#8217;s a book in your story. There&#8217;s a hundred percent a book in your story.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, I don&#8217;t know if anyone&#8217;s outright said that, but I definitely know there&#8217;s stuff in there that I always find it intriguing to look back in my past and see where I&#8217;ve been, and where I am, and how I&#8217;ve been inspired, and how I&#8217;m now able to inspire. That all is important to me. But yeah, thanks for saying that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, no, there&#8217;s a hundred percent a book in your story. I mean, one, I think just because of how you have managed yourself through how design and technology have changed, but then also I think your personal story added in as a layer on top of that. And with the work that you&#8217;re doing now through volunteering and giving back, that&#8217;s the best seller. You might want to think about it. You might want to think about it. I&#8217;m just saying I&#8217;m putting it out there.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Thanks. You&#8217;ll get their first copy for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Absolutely. So curvetheory.com. C-U-R-V-E-T-H-E-O-R-Y dot com is my commercial website. There is a link to my print work on there, which yeah, prints are great, but if you want to see the bulk of my commercial photography, landscape stuff, nature, and cityscapes, that&#8217;s a good place to go. I also am on Instagram Curve Theory on Instagram. And there I don&#8217;t really put a whole lot of design work on. I do have a separate account that I&#8217;m hoping to start building up my, putting all my design work on, but really photography&#8230; Years ago I had a mix of photography and design and it always just felt all over the place for me. And one of the things I always noticed when I go to other Instagram accounts and I see these really nicely curated feeds that everything just, there&#8217;s something nice about the continuity and you&#8217;re like beautiful landscapes, and then there&#8217;s a logo. It just feels odd placed. And so I took all my design stuff off of there and it&#8217;s just my photography on my Instagram account. But those are the best places to find me. And I&#8217;m also on LinkedIn. Reggie Tidwell on LinkedIn.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, Sounds good. Well, Reggie Tidwell, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I mean, of course, like I just mentioned about there&#8217;s a book in you, your story and the passion and the service that you&#8217;ve given back to the design community is something that I think is really inspiring for a lot of people. Certainly your local community. But I hope that people that listen to this interview also pick up on that as well, because you mentioned being raised by your grandmother and her being a teacher, those values that she instilled in you, you&#8217;re continuing to give those back out to the community, which are really the basis of your success. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Hundred percent agree about my grandmother, and thank you so much for having me on, Maurice. It&#8217;s been a pleasure talking with you.</p>

<p>I was introduced last year to Dr. Kenya Oduor through a Tech Circus panel we both participated in, and I&#8217;m really glad to have her on the show now so she can share her brilliance with you all! She is a human-centered designer, researcher, and strategist, and also runs her own consulting and staffing firm <a href="https://leangeeks.net/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Lean Geeks</a>. Very impressive!</p>
<p>We dove right in and talked about her increased focus at this stage of her career, and from there we discussed how Lean Geeks works and what she want to accomplish with the firm this year. She also spoke about growing up in Queens, studying to become a physical therapist, and then pivoting into human factors and user experience design. According to Kenya, getting comfortable with being uncomfortable is how you grow, and her path to where she is now certainly proves that!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Hi, Maurice. I am Dr. Kenya Oduor and I am a human-centered strategist researcher and designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s on your mind? How&#8217;s 2022 been treating you?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
What&#8217;s on my mind. So, I think there&#8217;s a lot going on right now in terms of coming out on the other end of COVID and understanding what that means to the work that my team and I do with our clients. And how much of this remote model will change to a more hybrid or in-person model, again. I think in looking at some of the work that we do for our clients, I think there&#8217;s a huge opportunity for those conversations to shift to what new expectations do users, customers, clients have around their products and services. So, I&#8217;m really curious, not only to see what that means in terms of work opportunities, but also what insights do we gain from the work that we do in that regard.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I&#8217;m also finding that my career is gravitating towards more focused on me being a Black woman. And 10 years, 15 years ago, I would&#8217;ve never imagined that my identity would matter so much to the trajectory of opportunities and the voice that I present out to the world and that thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s interesting. Can you talk about that a little bit more?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Sure. So, I never forgot who I was, just because in the industry that I&#8217;m in, I might be the only or have been the only woman in the room, the only Black person in the room or both. And so, it&#8217;s always been a constant reminder for me because at certain points in my career, I didn&#8217;t necessarily feel like I was an integral part of the organization, in terms of feeling like I&#8217;m a fit within the culture because of my differences, or I didn&#8217;t feel like I was necessarily heard as much as some of my peers were. But what I&#8217;m finding now is that all of that experience and all of that maybe insecurity, imposter syndrome or angst that I was feeling throughout my career, I feel like that&#8217;s all coming to a place where I&#8217;m now using it to tell my story.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s becoming what I never realized would be a story that a lot of people, Black, white, or otherwise, want to hear in terms of just, we all have our unique differences. And knowing that and embracing those differences and using that to your advantage in terms of, especially in the design room, using that to your advantage in terms of bringing a different perspective.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious if that change has happened since the summer of 2020 because I feel like for a lot of Black folks who I&#8217;ve had on the show&#8230; well, all the Black folks. I&#8217;ve only had Black folks on the show. Let me be clear about that. But I think every person I&#8217;ve had on has said since that summer, there&#8217;s been a shift.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Absolutely. I am more comfortable in the skin that I&#8217;m in and I am unapologetic about. And I&#8217;ve heard that in a lot of circles that I&#8217;m in, being unapologetically Black. And just recognizing that if you are uncomfortable with my identity and who I am, then that&#8217;s not my problem, that&#8217;s yours. I don&#8217;t have to work to make you feel more comfortable. I have to be me and recognize that. And especially, as a business owner, I recognize that clients that want to do business with me and my company have to be comfortable with who I am and that sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of your business, let&#8217;s talk about Lean Geeks. This is your design agency. Where did that name come from?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, the name came from, as a researcher by training and coming from the academic world and having a PhD in human subject research and that sort of thing, I recognize that throughout my career, a lot of times I would get the poo-poo to ideas of &#8220;let&#8217;s go and validate stuff.&#8221; I would get a lot of resistance where the immediate response that people would go to is, &#8220;It&#8217;s going to take too long. It&#8217;s going to be too complex. We don&#8217;t have time for that. We didn&#8217;t bank in that, that time to do those things.&#8221; So, I recognize that being able to position research around being lean research and scrappy where necessary is really, really important in terms of getting buy-in.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And the geek part comes from just as human factors professionals. I&#8217;m not the only one that subscribes to this, but what I found is a lot of my colleagues, we always have swapped stories about whenever we take on a project, we have to go really deep in understanding a new domain or a new type of industry and user within that industry. And so, we almost geek out in the things that we learn about medicine or what we learn about different industries that might be very different than what we would play in otherwise, banking and that kind of thing. So, it&#8217;s always interesting to think about all of those different industries and how you have to go deep in order to be effective in creating solutions or redesigns for services in those different fields.</p>

Now, your agency offers both consulting and staffing services to clients and you have what you call a human-centered approach. Tell me about your process.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Absolutely. So, the ideal, let me tell you about the ideal because this is what really excites me. When we have a client come to us and they&#8217;re in this phase of discovery where they have certain assumptions or certain hypotheses around what they could do or what their product could do differently. And so, having the opportunity to help define and execute on some research that validates their ideas, we usually provide them with more clarity on essentially what are the requirements for their solution.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And so, having the opportunity to do that and informing the experience design and having data to support our design approach is really, really, to me really exciting. Because it&#8217;s not one of those things where you or I on the team are going off of what we think is the right experience or approach. We&#8217;re using some of our experience to understand what is the best design, but we&#8217;re more so using data to validate the person&#8217;s ability to get something done. Okay? And in those types of projects, we help our client get to the point of sprint zero or basically giving them the different assets that are necessary to feed development and the engineering effort.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And the really ideal experience is when they then allow us to partner with them from a contractor perspective and having maybe an interaction designer or a strategist join their team as a contractor. So then, there&#8217;s continuity from the work that we did. So, it&#8217;s not as if we&#8217;re just throwing research and wire frames over the fence, we&#8217;re actually continuing on with their team. And that allows those individuals that did the research to stay connected to the project and help to still continue and inform the direction that things go in. And for me, if every project started and continued in that fashion, my life would be golden at that point. If that was the model that we could always follow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
To that end, it sounds like the best types of clients then for you to have are ones that possibly would have you all on retainer, because it sounds like the work that you&#8217;re doing continues along a timeline. You&#8217;re not just going in doing one thing and then that&#8217;s the end of the project.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I wish that we were on retainer. Typically, it&#8217;s the upfront research and the deliverables around requirements, priority, wire frames. All of that stuff is usually time boxed and it&#8217;s a fixed cost effort. Over my career, I think, being in a practitioner role and in a leadership role, I&#8217;ve gotten really good at being able to estimate how long an effort should take. So, those are usually time-boxed. And then when you talk about the contractors, those are typically your standard contractor on your team. Somebody that&#8217;s there six months and then they&#8217;re converted to a full timer or they&#8217;re on the project for two years as a contractor. So, those are typically, someone who has a badge and a computer from your company and they submit timesheets to our company. And we pay payroll and that sort of thing, benefits and all that sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds that&#8217;s where the lean part kicks in, at least in terms of being able to estimate the time pretty, pretty accurately.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Absolutely. The one thing that I&#8217;ve not necessarily learned, but has become really clear over the last few years, is that in any project recruitment is the longest [inaudible 00:12:55]. That&#8217;s going to be the hardest part of a project. And it&#8217;s going to take the longest is to recruit panelists to use for interviews, qualitative interviews, or to observe, or to have them do usability testing and that sort of thing. Recruitment is probably the hardest part of what we do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does an average day look for you with Lean Geeks?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
It typically, like most other people, getting up and checking your emails and &#8220;What do I need to do today?&#8221; It&#8217;s engaging with, I don&#8217;t want to say, prospects, because I don&#8217;t look at engagement with potential clients. I don&#8217;t look at them as prospects. I want to get the opportunity to talk to them. &#8220;Let me hear about what&#8217;s going on in your organization. What are your biggest struggles? What keeps you up at night?&#8221; So, having or scheduling conversations with different people is a lot of what I do.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I am focused on business development and closing the sale. So, I&#8217;m not so much doing the research work anymore or the design work as per se, but I try to bring in those projects. And I stay involved from the extent of knowing what&#8217;s going on, so that might also be a part of my day is checking in with the team to see how are things progressing. &#8220;Show me where you are. Maybe I have ideas or questions that help you to expand what you&#8217;re thinking is around a particular problem.&#8221; So, I also spend a portion of my day doing that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And I&#8217;ve had to get comfortable over the last year or more comfortable with marketing. So, just thinking about strategically, what is my brand and what is my voice and what do I want to put out there? And this goes back to my identity, becoming so much more of what I present to the world where historically that wasn&#8217;t necessarily something that I put as much importance in or on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now for those out there who may not have heard of human-centered design. Again, we talked about how you have this human-centered approach. Can you talk about what it is and why it&#8217;s important?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Absolutely. So, human-centered design is essentially, I don&#8217;t want to say putting the human first, it&#8217;s informing your approach to a solution with information around your user and their motivation, their needs, what are their goals in terms of interacting with your product or service. And most importantly, the most important part is context. And I teach a human computer interaction class and my students are software engineering students. And whenever they ask questions, I always get them to unpack their understanding of the context.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Because context really, really impacts our ability to assume what is someone thinking in a particular moment. What are the environmental factors that are outside of their control that they have to consider in using your product? When you think about your product, what features or capabilities need to be in the forefront because of that context? So, that to me is what human-centered design is all about is allowing someone or giving someone the tools that they need to get something done and to consider their motivation and their context in that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you to really accomplish with your business this year?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I really want to get to a place where obviously closing more business. Any business owner wants to continue to grow, so I always want to continue to grow in my business. I want to get connected to more designers and researchers that are in a freelance situation because I&#8217;m always looking for talent. And as you know right now, the market is really hot. So, either we&#8217;ve lost team members or we&#8217;re constantly looking for new ones and I think I do a pretty good job of spotting talent, but in most cases they&#8217;re already either fully committed or not available or whatever it might be at that particular time. So, that&#8217;s a huge goal of mine in 2022 is to build up our network in that regard and across the country, ideally. I have some little pet projects that I&#8217;m working on with colleagues and I would love to see some of those pet projects shape up a little bit more and for us to move from idea to concept.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit, because I want to get more into your background and learn more about really how you came about all of this. So, let&#8217;s start from the beginning here. Talk to me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and I was really young before I started school, we moved to Queens, New York. So, I grew up in Queens. Very different from Pittsburgh and it was very different going back and forth during the summers and holidays. And so, I grew up around a lot of people who might have been first generation Americans. And it was to me, I think that is what shapes my belief that culture and context have so much to do as inputs to any solution because I just remember being around people that were so different, but had similar goals.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Everybody wanted the best for their children. Everybody wanted to work hard and earn a living and that kind of thing. So, I knew that there was a common thread amongst the culture of the people that I was around. But I knew that, when I went into different people&#8217;s homes, the way they did things and the languages and all those sorts of things were different. So, I look back and when I talk to some of my friends growing up, we always talk about how unique our situation was. And we didn&#8217;t realize it until now that we&#8217;re adults living in different parts of the country.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s so interesting that hindsight, looking back and you don&#8217;t think about it at that time when you&#8217;re a kid, probably not even when you&#8217;re a teenager or a young adult. But I find the older I get, when I look back at how I grew up and how I first got into tech and everything like that. It&#8217;s abnormal for the time I think, but I didn&#8217;t even think about it because essentially at the time when I was doing this stuff, it just all felt like play. It just felt toys that I was working with, not actual computers. Teaching myself a language, that kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yeah. And I think that&#8217;s the beauty of, I&#8217;m the parent that, &#8220;Oh, I want them to do the things they enjoy and double down on the ones that they&#8217;re passionate about.&#8221; But I always have to tell myself that you have to also remind yourself and your kids that exposure to as many different things as possible really open your eyes to things you didn&#8217;t even know existed. And like you were talking about, the things that you did with computers early on, you would&#8217;ve never thought about the impact they would have on your career now is just we, as people, have to always look beyond what we&#8217;re comfortable with. Look at the beauty of art and how that translates into the beauty of what you can create. And just being able to translate some of what we see and experience into the work that we do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Did you have a lot of exposure to design or tech as you were growing up?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yeah. So, my parents coming from a small or from small towns in and around Pittsburgh, their intention in moving to New York was to be around culture and that kind of thing. So, my parents used to drag me to the theater when I was younger and I was always, &#8220;Ugh, we have to get dressed up and go to the theater.&#8221; And I used to go to the Museum of Modern Art or Guggenheim Museum. And I used to always look at it like such a chore, because it was maybe different than what my friends were doing or my friends didn&#8217;t go with me.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
But as an adult now, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, my goodness.&#8221; I thank them all the time because all of those different experiences and that exposure had so much to do with, my mother used to do art projects and she would get wood and carve it and then do stamping on fabric. And I look at all those experiences and say that creativity and just seeing different types of creativity, they remind you that there&#8217;s so much out there that can apply to what we see, what we do, what we experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when it was time for you to go to college, you went to the university of Maryland. Tell me about what your time was like there.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Too much fun. That&#8217;s why I was on a five-year plan. I knew when I was in high school that I wanted to go away to college. I didn&#8217;t want to stay in New York, surprisingly. As much as New York is a wonderful place, it&#8217;s exhausting. And I was talking to somebody else from New York the other day and we were saying how until you leave New York, you don&#8217;t realize how much life there is outside of New York because it takes so much out of you to do everything.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, I went to Maryland and I struggled with figuring out what do I want to do or what do I want to be? I started out as an engineering major. Then I got interested in psychology and people. And then I thought I wanted to be a physical therapist. So, I ended up having to do an extra year because I thought I was going to be a physical therapist and I had to do additional classes. But my time at Maryland was my awakening to experience Black culture more than when I was just going to see my family. Coming from Queens and then going to Maryland, I felt like my identity as a Black woman, I was able to see other people like myself, that I was actually around all the time and not just family that I&#8217;m going to see during a holiday.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, that for me was really interesting and exciting. And I just knew at that point that I wanted&#8230; I used to get the itch to say that one day I was going to start a business. What that was going to be, who knows. But I used to say to myself that I wanted to create something one day. So, I enjoyed Maryland, but obviously not enough to stay there because I&#8217;m in North Carolina now. But yeah, I enjoyed my time at Maryland.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One thing that I remember really, again, another hindsight thing that I remember is just how many different types of Black people I met at college. I&#8217;m from the country-country. Everybody is they&#8217;re Southern. You really don&#8217;t see other types of people unless it&#8217;s maybe on television or something like that. And I remember being at Morehouse here in Atlanta and meeting Caribbean people for the first time that wasn&#8217;t via Caribbean rhythms on BET. Actually meeting people from the Caribbean. Meeting people from other parts of the country and stuff. And realizing how much that really shaped my Black experience, but just the diversity of what is considered the Black experience.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
It&#8217;s true. And so the difference, I think&#8230; I have a cousin, actually, a cousin by marriage, who&#8217;s from Atlanta, born and raised. And I just found out recently that he did not see non-Black people until he went to college. And that blows my mind because for me, you see Atlanta obviously as a metropolis or a metropolitan area. And I think about the fact that to me, that&#8217;s so fascinating in the sense that you had exposure, you had the means and the capability to go to college and in your lived experience, you never saw people that were not Black. That tells me that the upbringing and the community had was one that helped you to get to where you needed to be in order to get to that next level, which I love.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And then I think about the flip side of it with my experience in growing up in Queens, I used to almost feel, I was one of the few people that were not white, whose family had several generations that went back in terms of being in the US. So, I almost felt like, I felt like the outsider because I was the one whose family had been slaves. And to have that connection to this country, but to have no one else around you that has that connection to this country, I felt like the outsider.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. And I think going to Maryland is where I experienced more of my people who were like me, descendants of slaves. And so, I could relate to them in a different way than I could my people in Queens.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, you were enjoying your time at University of Maryland, soaking in that good Black experience. What was your early career like after you graduated? What was next for you?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Oh, my gosh. Yeah. So, like I mentioned, I thought I was going to be a physical therapist, so I got a job even before I finished school. I got a job at a nonprofit that worked with special needs children as a physical therapy aide. And the place that I worked was in the hood, in Southeast DC. And I&#8217;ll never forget that that was probably my first immersive experience into seeing and experiencing, I&#8217;m not going to say we all, but I have the experience of growing up and having family that lives in public housing or we had to eat government cheese and all that stuff.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I had had that experience, but this was my first time really experiencing true poverty and seeing children who were probably in a situation that when they left school, they did not get food. They didn&#8217;t get their diapers changed. They came to school the next day with the same diaper on. So, that experience really opened my eyes to just the divide that existed in this country and the unfortunate result of real poverty that I&#8217;d never experienced, even if I was poor or with poor members. So it really, really became an emotional, not only was it hard to do therapy with special needs children, who born with fetal alcohol syndrome or vitamin K deficiency. Things that you would think are preventable.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
But it was just the emotional part of just seeing that even when they went home, there was no joy necessarily for some of them. That was hard. That was hard. So, it made me revisit only wanting to be there, but also, did I want to consider a different career?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that when you decided to go back to school after that?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yes. So, I would come home from work in the evenings and it&#8217;s just, so when I went to college, the email just came out the last semester before I graduated. So, me working on a computer was word processing and that kind of thing. And so, the internet was just starting to become popular when I would come home, for me, at least. It might have been for other people, but not for me. So, I would come home from work and get on the internet and start to do my search and look at different fields. And then I found Human Factor Psychology that way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And what about that appeal to you?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Because I don&#8217;t know if you remember me mentioning that I started out undergrad as an engineering major, so I was very interested in engineering. I was interested in designing things and creating things that would impact people and their lives. And I loved interacting with people. So, Human Factor Psychology was the intersection of those things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so, you attended North Carolina state studying this. This is where you got your master&#8217;s and then eventually, your PhD in Human Factors, Ergonomics/Experimental Psychology.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember from that time, whenever anyone talked about ergonomics or at least maybe in the context that I heard. It always was about office furniture like an ergonomic mouse, an ergonomic chair, an ergonomic desk. But of course, ergonomics is more than just that. Correct?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
It is. And it&#8217;s funny because when I first came to North Carolina State, I thought that was going to be more of my major and that my minor would involve psychology. But when I got here, I got to know more about the psychology program and I flipped it. And I was like, &#8220;No, I really. I enjoy more of the experimental and cognitive psychology and the physical is also a part of your context in your environment.&#8221; So, that was to a lesser extent, my areas of interest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now prior to founding Lean Geeks, I know that you worked for a long time at two companies, but you also alluded that you&#8217;ve worked for other places as well. But you worked at IBM for seven years, which people know for big tech and you worked at LexisNexis for eight years, which I know is a service that a lot of lawyers use, I believe, for background checks and things like that. But with both of these work experiences, you were focusing on user experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not asking you to necessarily give the years, but I&#8217;m curious on during that time, how did you notice user experience in the design community? Was it something that a lot of people were latching onto or how did you see it at that time?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, IBM was my first foray in the whole user experience. True user experience realm in terms of, so I shouldn&#8217;t say that. I take that back because the definition of user experience for so many people is something different than what some of us know or understand it to be. When I started out, it was human-centered design and this was in consulting and then IBM. And it started with discovery of who&#8217;s your user, what is their context and what is their need or motivation. And so, at that time, I think IBM was one of the companies that was in the forefront in terms of doing the work to constantly iterate and validate on ideas or concepts.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And as time went on, what I saw was more of an evolution towards design, more of UX than being termed design or focusing on design less about the validation or the discovery aspect of things. Probably midway in my career is when I started to see people who would talk about stumbling into a career in UX, or they might have been painters or people who did visual arts or, industrial design and that their interests. And of course there were people earlier than that time, but in terms of my experiences in the software world, that&#8217;s when I started to see more people coming from the more design community. More of the design community that were playing in the software space. But my early experiences were primarily people who were coming out of the human center design space.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting. How are those IBM and LexisNexis experiences, how were they from each other?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I was just talking to someone earlier today, a student that is considering a transition into UX and I was explaining to her that one environment was very structured and the other was very unstructured. And so, when you talk about structured versus unstructured environments, it&#8217;s what rigor do they have in place and how mature are they from a user experience perspective? Do they have the right people in the organization and do they have a design system and that kind of thing, a process? Do they have validation baked into their framework sorts of things?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, one was very different than the other in that regard. And some people thrive better in one versus the other. But I realized in my career, I made an intentional decision to shift from one to the other because I wanted to see and to build up my own toolkit of navigating two different environments. And I think that&#8217;s helped me in the consulting world, because I&#8217;m able to spot where an organization&#8217;s mature is and how to interact with the people in the companies that we work with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so, what was the impetus behind you starting your own company? You&#8217;ve put in now 15 years in this industry, working as a user experience professional with human-centered design research. What made you say I&#8217;m going to start my own thing now?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, it had been probably more than 15 years at that point that I was saying to myself, I was getting that itch of wanting to spread my wings and go somewhere new. And I explained it or I likened it one day to someone that every day I walked into the office, I felt like I was a caged bird that had to get in the cage. And then every day at the end of the day, I felt like I was stepping out of the cage. And so, I felt like I was being constrained by the four walls of industry. And I didn&#8217;t feel like part of that came from presenting ideas that didn&#8217;t necessarily align in terms of &#8220;it&#8217;s not your job&#8221; kind of thing or &#8220;we&#8217;re not there yet,&#8221; that kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, it got frustrating and I said to myself, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m either going to move on to a new company and take on a similar type of role. My highest level of evangelism and hiring and all that stuff and firing.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well, do I want to do that? And do I want to go through that same climbing the ladder.&#8221; And honestly, I didn&#8217;t want to and I felt that it had almost been 20 years at that point that I was doing this work. And so, I was like, &#8220;You know what? It&#8217;s time for me to spread my wings and try something new and take the show on the road.&#8221; And I&#8217;ve built a pretty good network over those years, so why not tap into that network and see what happens?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You stepped out on faith and here you are.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I stepped out on faith and I have to tell you that statement right there is the only thing that has kept me going is stepping out every day. When you talk about my day-to-day, every day is stepping out on faith and it&#8217;s a faith walk and it&#8217;s constantly reminding yourself that just because you don&#8217;t know something today or it&#8217;s an unknown or it&#8217;s uncomfortable, you got to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. And always know that you have to do the work to figure stuff out, even if you don&#8217;t know it today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Who are some of the mentors that have helped you to get to this place now in your career?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I always had formal mentors when I was at places like IBM. I had people who I leaned on, who were able to help guide me in that way. But as I got further into my career, I found that I didn&#8217;t have as many mentors or the people that I sought out as mentors weren&#8217;t necessarily either in my discipline or they just didn&#8217;t have the bandwidth to take on additional mentors. I started to do a lot in terms of coaching and finding other resources.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting. I would imagine and I&#8217;ve talked about this with other like PhD level people that I&#8217;ve had on the show is like it&#8217;s lonely at the top. Once you get to that level of education and you get to that point in your career, you look around and it&#8217;s just you in a way.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. And it&#8217;s interesting because I would see people and I would see people who were in a position of running their own company or who were in a certain type of leadership role. And I would look at them and say to myself, &#8220;I aspire to be there.&#8221; And what I found in a lot of cases was that, they were and it was no slight on their part in any way. They would just say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have the bandwidth to take on the responsibility of being a mentor.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, I would get whatever opportunity I could to connect with them and then figure out who do I want to be when I grow up and what does that look like. And, and I think the part that&#8217;s most important for anyone that&#8217;s exploring that thing is to always, always, always connect with people and ask questions and invest in yourself. That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve recognized I have to do a lot of.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
When you meet people and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I hate my job&#8221; or &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so unhappy,&#8221; or &#8220;My kids are stressing me out,&#8221; just have life stressors. What I&#8217;m really happy about my life is that I&#8217;m fortunate to be in a situation where life is hard. I work really hard, but the joy that my family and my career and my company, the joy that I get from those things mean so much to me. And I feel like I&#8217;m so fortunate. Even if things are hard, I&#8217;m so fortunate to have the ability to do these things at this point in my life.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And to not have the grumbling. Whenever I work with colleagues or whenever I talk to colleagues or I work with a client, it&#8217;s so refreshing to know that whatever drama I get pulled into for work projects. As soon as I hang up the phone, leave the meeting or whatever it is, I don&#8217;t take any of it home like I used to when I worked in-house.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What haven&#8217;t you done yet that you want to do? It could be in life. It can be through your business. What&#8217;s the dream project?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, I definitely want to travel more now, especially after COVID. I want to travel more, but more importantly, I have colleagues that I&#8217;m working on side projects with and we&#8217;ve been talking about them. And some of them were things are starting to get off the ground, but I would really love to see some of those things come to pass in terms of us being able to realize and to see things happen.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I always, I&#8217;m very much a visionary. So, I put out there if you have a vision board or they say do visualization of what you want to do or where you want to be. And I see myself creating something that is impactful. So, just doing project work or engaging clients around project work is one facet of my interest. I also have ideas that I feel like I need to bring to life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of, this traveling now, you and I have both spoken on a couple of panels now. Are you starting to see a return to in-person events? Are you getting invited to speak out at any conferences?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Yes. I have a speaking engagement next month in the Baltimore area. I have a few, I want to say late summer or early fall. So, I do realize that things are starting to open up. I actually spoke on a panel recently. So, I&#8217;m excited to see and to interact with people in-person, because I feel like the connections. And I had a conversation with someone that I met in-person after meeting them over or talking to them over Zoom a number of times. You really don&#8217;t get the value of connecting with someone the way that you do when you meet that individual in-person first and then transition to virtual versus the other way around. Because it&#8217;s like you make that connection with people face-to-face that you can&#8217;t make over a screen. So, I&#8217;m looking forward to that again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I just got my first in-person conference invite in a while. I just got it a couple of days ago. So, I&#8217;m leaking it early by saying it on the podcast, but I&#8217;ll be at Design Thinkers in Toronto in October, which is cool. Because I&#8217;ve always wanted to visit Toronto and to now go and do my first in-person conference thing really since&#8230; gosh, I think the last time I did one was in maybe 2019, I think, probably 2019. Wow.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Wow, so it&#8217;s time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s time.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:41:49].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve done a ton of virtual things, so it&#8217;s time to get back on a stage. So, I&#8217;m excited about that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s time, yes. Well, I can tell you that since COVID my whole dress and shoe game is different, so all about-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, really?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
I&#8217;m all about comfort now. So, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;If you say I was going to put on heels and all that, forget about it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to anyone that&#8217;s been listening to all of this and they want to follow in your footsteps? What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, I would tell them that don&#8217;t ever look at any experience that you have as a waste of your time or that it&#8217;s in vain. From the time I first moved, when I first moved to North Carolina and I was an administrative assistant in an engineering firm to the jobs that I&#8217;ve had that have nothing to do with what I&#8217;m doing today, each one of those experiences gave me a perspective on interacting with people. Gave me a perspective on myself, what I&#8217;m good at, what I&#8217;m not good at, where my strengths are.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, every experience that you have in life and know that they all build upon one another, even if they&#8217;re not in the same field. And always walk away from bad experiences with the ability to say, &#8220;What did I learn from it?&#8221; Especially when you work with people that get on your nerves or you can&#8217;t stand, figure out what it is you can learn from that. And getting comfortable with being uncomfortable is another thing.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
The only way we grow is by going through some change and I found that I can procrastinate on the things I don&#8217;t want to be bothered with or do. But when I look back, sometimes I delay the things that really were in my mind overwhelming, but once I got into them, they weren&#8217;t. So, don&#8217;t put off for tomorrow what you can do today. And know that you don&#8217;t know if you can do something unless you try. That&#8217;s the way I see it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s the legacy that you want to leave behind? Where do you see yourself say in the next five years or so? What work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
So, in the next five years or so, I realize in my whole marketing effort that honing in on my brand, my personal brand is something that before I used to, I was always the little young, skinny one in the crew throughout my life. So, I was always quiet and in the background and the observer. So, I never really thought that my brand or who I am or what I have to say was necessarily that impactful or important. But as I get older and I have platforms to do that, I realize, &#8220;Wow, I do have things to say that people are listening to.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And so, I think in the next five years, continuing to sharpen my brand and my voice are a big part of my focus and that I want to be able to use my skills around being an idea generator, being a connector, helping people to progress ideas. I like to see others, I thrive by seeing others thrive. So, being able to utilize that capability and everything that I do would be just the most awesome thing ever for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good question. So, definitely connect on LinkedIn, Kenya Oduor, PhD. Last name is O-D-U-O-R. I wish I would have kept my maiden name if I knew my last name was going to be so hard. Check out the web company website leangeeks.net, L-E-A-N-G-E-E-K-S dot-net. And I think LinkedIn is the best place to start because from there, you can get to YouTube video thing. You can get my contact information.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
And I just like to connect with people and like I said, I&#8217;m trying to build up my network of folks, especially like us designers and creators and researchers that look like us are important for me to connect with at this point in my career. Especially those that I don&#8217;t know now or yet. Yeah. Keep in touch.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Dr. Kenya Oduor, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. One, of course, I think just thank you for telling us about your story. But also about putting forth, this really powerful message about look at your experiences and see what you can gain out of them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
My mom used to tell me when I was younger, especially early on in my career before I started becoming a designer, sometimes you have to do the things that you don&#8217;t want to do, so you can do the things that you want to do or something like that. I might be screwing up that whole thing.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Amen. No, but that to me, I get it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s true. Sometimes you have to put the time in, you have to see what you can gain from those experiences, and then use those to become a better person. And certainly, I think from what you&#8217;ve shown in this interview and then even with what you&#8217;re doing through Lean Geeks, you&#8217;re definitely making that happen. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kenya Oduor:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me, Maurice. And continued success to you as well.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re halfway through the year! Summer&#8217;s here, and I thought it would be a great time to feature an extraordinary young designer whose work I recently discovered &#8212; Keisha Okafor. Her work is brimming with energy and vibrancy and joy &#8212; feelings we all could use a bit more of these days.</p>
<p>We start off talking about freelance design, and Keisha told a bit about how she helped <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rERRIna8dA" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">make one of the features Google Doodles for Black History Month 2021</a>. Keisha also spoke on her signature design style, talked about one of her dream projects, and gave some great advice on being an illustrator. Keep an eye out for Keisha &#8212; I think we&#8217;ll definitely see more of her work in the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
My name is Keisha Okafor. I&#8217;m a freelance illustrator. And I would say that my work I&#8217;ve been using depicts joy and celebrates people. I really like to use bright colors and bold patterns.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s the year been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going pretty great. I actually just went freelance full time. So that&#8217;s the thing. But before that, I&#8217;ve been working full time in design as a production designer, actually for print and also doing project management. Ironically, I was managing all the print projects I was doing. So kind of like a one-woman show. So all of that was very technical and like sending client emails. And then out of work, I was doing illustrations and drawing and working with my freelance clients. So it&#8217;s nice to have more time this time, but honestly, it&#8217;s been going pretty well. I mean, I know the whole pandemic is still happening. In my mind, it&#8217;s not even close to being over, but as a very, very heavy introvert, my day-to-day isn&#8217;t really that different, I be inside. So I&#8217;m still watching Anime, still playing video games. Yeah. Outside of work is pretty normal to me because I wouldn&#8217;t be outside anyway.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Wow. So yeah, you just went freelance. That&#8217;s a kind of scary thing to do to make that leap of faith. I mean, did you feel like you were prepared for it when you did it?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. I definitely did, which is surprising because years ago, would have been terrified, but I did a lot of planning, I watched so many seminars and workshops about going freelance, like what do you need to have in place before you do that? And I also saw enough clients coming in and projects coming in to where I believed like this is going to keep happening. I&#8217;m not just a Juneteenth, Martin Luther King Day illustrator. I can do this 365. So once I saw that and all the other planning I&#8217;ve been doing for the past several months, I wasn&#8217;t as scared as I expected to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s good. That&#8217;s good. I mean, oftentimes, we&#8217;ll have the designers that are here on the show that either are freelancing or they&#8217;re thinking about going freelance, and making that leap can often be really scary. I mean, you said that you had some preparations in place, which is good. I mean, to know that you can step out there and have at least some sort of a foundation, so you&#8217;re not necessarily going at it alone, but you have, it sounds like you had some major things already planned out before you made the jump, like clients.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. I also had savings. That was like my main thing. I didn&#8217;t want to jump with like $25 in my account. So with all the freelance money I&#8217;ve been getting, luckily because I had the full-time job, I was able to save all of that pretty much by pretending that I didn&#8217;t have it. I was tricking my mind, like, don&#8217;t spend this, this is for your future. Like, don&#8217;t wild out and buy stuff, but I&#8217;m also not naturally a big spender. My biggest splurge last year was getting Netflix, the two accounts. Yeah. I mean, I bought video games, but I would&#8217;ve done that anyway, but yeah, I got Netflix. So that&#8217;s like an idea of something I think about, a purchase that I would think about for a while before doing so. Was able to save all that money to have bought a year&#8217;s worth just in case nothing happened, which I don&#8217;t believe that was going to happen, but just in case, I had enough money to live off of that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a very smart move.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Thanks. I take risks, but it&#8217;s very calculated because I get very scared, just the idea of going freelance is so scary. So I just wanted to make sure I have things set in place, I thought it through that I&#8217;ll be good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What made you decide to go freelance? You said you were working as part-time gig, did something happen or did you just feel like it was just time to go?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Honestly, just in general, the jobs I&#8217;ve had, it was a full-time job too. Boy, was I tired anyway. It was just like, no matter what job I had, it ended up being rinky-dink. And by rinky-dink, I mean, no matter how confident I am, no matter how competent I am at the job, no matter how much work I do, how fast I go, I&#8217;m still getting treated like I&#8217;m entry-level or like the level of a recent graduate in my pay, in how I&#8217;m talked to when I ask questions. And I&#8217;m just getting tired of that. And because I saw that doing freelance wasn&#8217;t as intimidating as I thought, I was just like, let me better myself and make sure that I&#8217;m handling that side for myself, that I get to advocate for myself and also determine what I&#8217;m worth.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is a big reason why I ended up going freelance back in 2008, the company that I was working for was treating me in that same way, like I felt like I was being undermined or belittled or patronized too, even though I&#8217;ve got the skills to be there and I&#8217;m cranking out top quality work, you still feel like you&#8217;re almost treated like a child.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yes. Oh my gosh. Yeah. This past job, the work I was doing, it took four people to do before I got there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. And they&#8217;re not a startup company. They&#8217;ve been around for many years over a decade. And even taking on that work, they still saw me as a rookie. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Really after all of this?&#8221; So I could see that that wasn&#8217;t really going to change anytime soon. They would give me compliments, but I&#8217;m like, &#8220;But my pay isn&#8217;t changing.&#8221; And when I say things and give suggestions, it&#8217;s just going over the head and out the window. So I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;All right, I see where this is going. I&#8217;m out.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What does a typical day look like for you right now? I know you just started freelancing, but have you started getting into a good rhythm?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. Generally, I have a Trello account, where I have all my freelance projects that I&#8217;m working on right now and just different to-do lists, broken down to all the small steps, just so I can see overall what I need to work on. So if there are any priorities or upcoming deadlines, I&#8217;ll then write a list, a to-do list of like at least three things I want to get done during the day, like I want to finish this sketch or I want to finish this piece, send this email to the client, things like that. I usually start my day at around 10 o&#8217;clock. I am not a morning person at all. Also, I have a cat who only wants to be pet in the middle of the night. So from like 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM, she&#8217;s crawling on my chest, like, &#8220;Pet me, pet me.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Let me sleep.&#8221; That&#8217;s why I start at 10:00 to get back some of that sleep I lost.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
But yeah, I usually start eating cereal, see if I have any emails. I don&#8217;t really get too many emails, but I&#8217;m also someone who like, I get through them. So I usually only have like three tops. And then I just start the work I&#8217;m doing. And if, and then I just keep reviewing that Trello list with my deadlines and checking things off. And if I&#8217;m like at the right pace, because I&#8217;m trying to pace myself doing a little each day to make sure I hit the deadlines early, instead of like binge doing it all in one day. So once I hit that pace for the day, if I&#8217;m done, then I&#8217;ll take a break and rest for the day. Yeah. That&#8217;s generally how it&#8217;s been going so far.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. The best thing about freelancing is really setting your own schedule and then no one can tell you to change it. It&#8217;s completely up to you. So if you want to stay in till 10:00 AM, till noon, you can do that. No problem.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. It still feels like, I feel like a kid beginning summer break, but then I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Keisha, you&#8217;re an adult.&#8221; Make sure you get stuff done, which I always do. But waking up at 10 o&#8217;clock and being like, &#8220;Well, time to get this started.&#8221; That still feels wild to me. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I get to do this. I planned for this and it&#8217;s happening.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Now, I first heard about you this year from your work you did for YouTube&#8217;s Black History Month campaign. I think they did four different illustrators and artists for each of the four weeks in February. Can you talk about that? How did you become a part of that project?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah, that still blows my mind. This was like maybe a week before Christmas. I randomly get this email saying, &#8220;Hey, Keisha, I work with YouTube. Want to work on this project about Black Creativity for Black History Month?&#8221; I immediately thought it was a scam. And then I googled everyone that he mentioned just to make sure kind of just like, who are you? What the heck? His email didn&#8217;t say @youtube.com. So I was just like, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know about this. Let me just double check.&#8221; But I googled everyone and then their LinkedIn pages were like, they&#8217;re designer at Google, engineer at Google. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, okay. So he was serious.&#8221; So I immediately said, &#8220;Yeah, I am available to do this. Are you kidding me?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. And then probably a week or so later, I met with like a small design team at the YouTube. And they were just telling me about the initiative that they had and they want to work for artists celebrating History Month and wanted to have all the artists make art around black creativity. And that was it. They were like, &#8220;You can make that whatever you want it to be, but it just needs to be around black creativity.&#8221; And they gave some keywords, like forward-thinking, hopeful, bright, like that. Literally, those were the keywords they gave. So I pretty much just took that and ran with it. But also in the back of my mind, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay. Okay, Keisha, this is YouTube. You got to show up, you got to show out. So like, do it, do the thing.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
So initially, I was planning on doing portraits of women who in math and science from the past just to celebrate them. But then they wanted something, when they said forward-thinking, that&#8217;s why they gave me the idea of having children in there, like giving like a hopeful idea instead of looking to the past, wanting people to look to the future as well. And I was the one who chose math and science, just because normally when you think of creativity, I usually think of a paintbrush, like dancing and music.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
And they also mentioned that they didn&#8217;t want to hit the normal black stereotypes. So like a boombox and people doing break dance. They want it to steer away from that. So I personally like math. I still, even at my big age, I watch PBS Kids shows about math and science. So I figured that would be a fun thing to do, a fun thing to go around. And that&#8217;s in that forward thinking idea, it was me having like women in STEM, showing young girls the magic in front of it. So that&#8217;s where the idea came based on their feedback. That&#8217;s how that idea came to pass.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. And once they approved it, I was just going with it. The main critique was at first, I made everyone dark skin and almost the same tone. And they were like, &#8220;Oh, can you give it some variety?&#8221; I go, &#8220;Oh yeah, no problem.&#8221; And then they wanted me to use like, I was being very literal at first. So like the sky is blue, rockets are gray. And they were like, &#8220;Can you use like some of the colors that you use? Like the ones that you use.&#8221; And I was just like, &#8220;Oh, okay. So you actually want me to put my spin on it.&#8221; I was putting all these rules, adding all these rules to myself. This has to be very literal. If I&#8217;m drawing math, it needs to look like math. But once they said that, then that&#8217;s when I went crazy with the colors, like, &#8220;This guy could be pink and yellow and purple.&#8221; So yeah. Then I added my own spin to that. And that&#8217;s pretty much how it turned out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I have to say it looks amazing. And for people that haven&#8217;t seen it, we&#8217;ll make sure to put a link to it in the show notes so you can definitely check it out. I mean, I get that kind of forward feeling, that forward-thinking notion from that. It&#8217;s interesting enough, I had discovered an organization, I think they either left a comment or I saw it somewhere else on the web, but because your piece was centered around STEM, I had discovered this group called Black Girl MATHgic, like Black Girl Magic, but MATHgic. And I mean, I love math too. My degree is in mathematics. So I saw that, I was like, &#8220;That is so cute.&#8221; That was the cutest thing I&#8217;ve ever seen. It&#8217;s like it&#8217;s a program, but then they also sell some merch for fundraising and stuff. I was like, &#8220;This is really dope teaching young black girls math fundamentals and stuff.&#8221; It&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Oh, that is so amazing. I just love that so much. And the lack Girl MATHgic, Oh my gosh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like you working with YouTube on this was like a really kind of collaborative process. Are those sort of the best types of clients for you to work with?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yes. I would say that working with YouTube was definitely like ideal client. They were very responsive, followed the schedule, they communicated so well. And they were also really nice, like we&#8217;re working with big clients, I just assumed like they were going to be very strict and we need to have it look a certain way. They want to work with people, but they want it to look a certain way, it&#8217;s what I expected. But working with them, I really saw that they wanted me to show myself in there and to put my own spin. When they said, put your own spin on a theme of black creativity, they actually meant it. That&#8217;s why I mentioned the thing with the colors. That was like very refreshing for me, something I really enjoy, like the great communication, being responsive, when things were delayed, they adjusted the schedule to match the delay. I was like, &#8220;You&#8217;re amazing.&#8221; Yeah. I really enjoyed them as a client. And those are things that seeing that it&#8217;s possible, those are things that I start to look for when I&#8217;m working with people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s go back to freelancing just a little bit more. When you have a new client or you&#8217;re approaching, let&#8217;s say, a new project, what does your creative process look like?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. So usually, I try to get as much information from the client at the beginning as possible because a lot of people say, &#8220;Oh, just do whatever.&#8221; But they actually have something in mind. So I try to ask a lot of initial questions, just to get an idea, like, do you have an idea or do you actually want me to give you my ideas? I just want that to be clear from the very beginning before I start doing research. And then I also asked like a lot of technical questions, how much do you want the resolution to be? What size? What&#8217;s your timeline? Because if it&#8217;s a small timeline, then I won&#8217;t try to do this super complex thing. I&#8217;ll make it simpler.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
But in terms of like the creative making the thing once that&#8217;s settled, I usually do a lot of research on stock websites. I like iStockphoto, just to get an idea of like composition, and if it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m not familiar with, I can&#8217;t just think of 35 math formulas off the top of my head. I just got f of x imprinted in my mind, but I need more. So I like to look at stock websites just to see what kinds of things are default, their body poses, body expressions, what do real people look like? Because I don&#8217;t want every person I draw to have the same face, but different bodies and different hairstyles. That feels weird to me, but I like when other people do it.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. So I like to go on stock websites just to see if anything is giving me ideas, is it inspirational? Is it good for reference? And once I get that, I&#8217;ll start sketching out different ideas, trying out different compositions, just to see like, does anything look good? Can I draw this thing? What are the hands going to look like? And then usually, that&#8217;s when I start going back and forth with the client, seeing what they think of my ideas.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
But if anything&#8217;s going in the right way, usually, that&#8217;s also the time I&#8217;ll ask, &#8220;Do you have any other ideas once you see this, a better idea of what you&#8217;re looking for kind of thing?&#8221; And then once that happens, I&#8217;ll either revise it or start going with color, again, make more ideas, send that to them. And then it&#8217;s usually just a back and forth, giving them the art and then getting their feedback. But as I&#8217;ve been working and seeing like how easily that can turn into a 100 revisions, I put limits like, okay, we&#8217;re going to have two rounds of revisions. And if you want more, this is going to cost. So yeah, I say back and forth, but it&#8217;s back and forth like twice just to protect my time essentially.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, even with all of this, are you also thinking a lot about, let&#8217;s say, colors, like a color story or anything to go along with a new project? Or does that come naturally?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Sometimes it comes naturally, but I also have a Pinterest board just full of different pictures that are like, it&#8217;s either a fashion outfits, stationary, graphic design branding, things like that. But if I don&#8217;t have any ideas, I&#8217;ll just pick from that, like, oh, let me try this, or since I&#8217;m on social media a lot and have a lot of artists I follow, there are just some artists I like the way they use color. There&#8217;s an artist, her name is Olivia Fields. And one thing she likes to do is have a very monochromatic color scheme, but she uses value so well it&#8217;s still very interesting to look at. So if I&#8217;m thinking about that lately, I&#8217;ll like, let me try to use a monochromatic scheme just to see what it look like if I do it kind of thing. If it doesn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;ll just trash it. But yeah, it can either come from other artists, that Pinterest board or I&#8217;ll just start off with, I want the main color to be yellow and then I&#8217;ll just randomly pick colors and adjust it based on that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. So I want to switch gears here a little bit based on what we were talking about prior to recording. You mentioned you&#8217;re from North Carolina, that&#8217;s where you grew up. Tell me what it was like growing up as a creative kid in North Carolina.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. I will say my grew up story isn&#8217;t similar to like the ones I hear on interviews. People will be like, &#8220;I drew all the time, I love drawing.&#8221; I drew some of the time and I was mostly watching cartoons, animated movies, just a lot of TV, playing a lot of video games. It wasn&#8217;t until I was 13 that I even decided like, oh, I want to do something art related. It was from seeing the Incredibles. I saw the behind the scenes animation thing. And I was like, &#8220;I want to be an animator.&#8221; But then once I got closer to picking a college and saw what animation was, very quickly, it was like, no, I don&#8217;t want to do that.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
I want to draw because I used to draw like a little bit, when I say every once in a while, I mean like a handful of drawings per year. I wasn&#8217;t really, I liked to draw, but I wasn&#8217;t sitting around drawing all the time because I was just overthinking it so much, I would draw, one time, I drew the Powerpuff Girls, like just very stiff Powerpuff Girls poses and look like them. But then I took it to school for the next few days and showed everyone. I was like, &#8220;Praise me. I&#8217;m a good artist. Look at me.&#8221; And then didn&#8217;t draw for like the next few months.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
That was me as a kid artist, but still very much enjoyed it. I took art classes in middle school and high school. And I would say that&#8217;s where my artistic skills and sense and interests started to grow. I wasn&#8217;t doing anything like extracurricular. I was just taking it as an elective. So by the time I got to college, I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any other interests. I want to be an artist. And I&#8217;m hoping college will unlock the key to figure out how people actually get paid to make art.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I mean, you went to North Carolina State University, which we&#8217;ve had several alums just here on the show that have went there. While you were there, do you feel like they really prepared you to become a working designer out in the world?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Now, when I look back at it now, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh yeah, they actually did.&#8221; But at the time, I didn&#8217;t think so at all, because it just felt very vague, because I also, I majored in art and design at NC State and I thought that meant I&#8217;m going to paint, like be an artist. They attach design to it. But they really mean art, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
It was like the first week they were like, &#8220;Hey, I know you guys like to draw and paint, but we&#8217;re not teaching you to be artists, we&#8217;re teaching you to be designers.&#8221; And in my mind, I was just like, &#8220;No, what is design? Oh, no.&#8221; Looking back on it now, I see they were teaching us how to think like designers and how to problem solve. And that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been so helpful. And also, with drawing, making sure you understand the foundations of drawing, that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been using a lot as well, but really that problem solving thing and also how to think like a designer, I would say that&#8217;s been the most helpful in my design career. But in terms of like how to get a job, how to make a good portfolio for a job, nope. I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;I wish I did something about it.&#8221; But now that I am working and have had jobs, those design fundamentals have actually been very helpful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Now, after college, you ended up for a while moving out to LA, what prompted that?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
It was actually like one of those moments of close family member passed away. So it was just very much like life is short kind of moment, let me try things that I would never do, just you never know you get this chance again. And growing up, watching a lot of TV, California always looked cool. And that was one of my bucket list thing, like I want to see what it&#8217;s like to live in California. So once that chance came up, I just went for it, oh, man. So scared. I was sweating on that plane just, Ooh, oh my gosh. I was so scared. But yeah, that&#8217;s how I ended up getting there.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
And really, my goal was just to see, like, can I go there and survive? Can I do enough to make sure I don&#8217;t have a flight back in three months? And I ended up staying for four and a half years, going on five years. I came back to North Carolina at the end of 2019, months before, I mean, months before COVID happened. So I am so, oh, I don&#8217;t have family in California. So that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m like, I am so glad I moved just in time so I could be near my family and at least know they&#8217;re safe in person versus a phone call from like 3000 miles away.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, while you were out there, did you get a chance to really experience the LA design scene?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t think so. When people say that, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;So where&#8217;s the scene at? And how do I get there?&#8221; My only experience was through the jobs I had. And comparing it to North Carolina, the main difference I noticed was that things were way more fast-paced. Yeah, that was like the biggest difference I noticed. And also like, but this is with anything. Once you see the process behind things, it takes that bale away. Things aren&#8217;t as glamorous as I initially thought, like I had a job at a media buying agency, where I was editing album covers for social media posts or resizing banner ads that will be put on YouTube, like watching the YouTube video and seeing of like, oh, this looks so like, well, one it&#8217;s annoying, but also seeing like a big artist with an ad, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ooh, fancy.&#8221; But hearing the media buyers trying to get the space and make it and asking me to resize things and how crazy that process can be, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Okay. These are just regular people trying to just do their jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
And I would say a big thing that just in general in the workforce, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Man, people procrastinate so much.&#8221; I thought that was like one of those warnings I got in college, like, you&#8217;ll never be able to procrastinate when [inaudible 00:27:40], but adults do that all the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All the time.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yes. Oh my gosh. And it happens so much. When I was working on those album covers, I was just like, &#8220;Come on guys. Just please send me the picture so I can resize it.&#8221; But it did help me build up efficiency because there were such fast turnarounds. I was used to working at a fast pace. So coming back to North Carolina, that&#8217;s how I ended up, when I mentioned earlier doing the work of four people, because I was used to working so fast. Like when things are slower here, it wasn&#8217;t that big of a deal. It felt normal. It helped me in that sense. But yeah, you asked about the design scene. I would also love to know what the scene was like, where was the all people? Where were the people at? What do design people do? I didn&#8217;t really get that question answered.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, it&#8217;s interesting because like, you mentioned earlier like, well, where is the design scene? I think designers carve out their own scene based on who they&#8217;re working with or working for, who they have met or inspired by. I&#8217;ve been to LA only once, I went in the beginning of 2020 in February. And I found that it was just like real, it was just so spread out. I mean, Atlanta is spread out, but LA is way more spread out. I&#8217;m like, it takes forever to get anywhere. Like if you&#8217;re going to go somewhere, you better hope it&#8217;s on your side of town, you don&#8217;t have to cross over and go down. It&#8217;s so big. I was there for two weeks and I know I only saw maybe like a 10th of LA. It&#8217;s so big. So big. I mean, I guess when I asked about like how the design scene was, I&#8217;m curious if it was different from maybe the design scene that you knew back home in North Carolina, like you mentioned, it was more fast-paced, but were there other differences?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good question. I will say, like you mentioned, because everything was so separated, it was kind of like, if you weren&#8217;t in that neighborhood, we&#8217;re not going to meet or we&#8217;re not going to meet often. So it ends up being like pockets of communities that I would notice. So I had a lot of animation friends because they lived in Glendale and Burbank and they were interested in working at Cartoon Network or Disney TV.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
So I would meet those people in Burbank and Glendale, but then the people who were interested in more of graphic design or stationary, I talked to those people down near the beach because that&#8217;s where a lot of the agencies were. It was like, I could find pockets of people in different areas, but it was so rare for them all to come together just because how long it took to go places like, like literally, Google Maps will say something is maybe 10 miles away and you think, oh, I&#8217;ll get there no time. That&#8217;s an hour trip one way. I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t add up.&#8221; But then you take the trip and I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;That took an hour. Oh my gosh.&#8221; So it&#8217;s just like people aren&#8217;t going to make that. Even people who were natives, they weren&#8217;t really going to make that trip on a regular basis. So it was just like pockets of communities that I would have in the different places I was at depending on where I lived and worked. That&#8217;s how I ended up seeing the people.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
But I feel like in North Carolina, everyone is in Raleigh, you&#8217;re in Raleigh, I can get to the edge of Raleigh, the top, it will take like 20 minutes. So to me, compared to being in LA, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not a big trip at all.&#8221; So I feel like people are taking more initiative to meet up, and I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s because of COVID as well, have like a lot of meetups and groups and workshops and stuff. Whereas it would be like a once in a lifetime thing to do, I&#8217;ll take this trip one time an hour for this workshop, but don&#8217;t count on me to come every week.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And the web is going to change things too. I mean, there&#8217;s events and workshops and things. A lot of stuff has come online just over the past year that before either didn&#8217;t exist or it was just inaccessible because of location or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. Adobe MAX, the first time I attended it was last year because it was virtual. I lived in LA and it happened there every year, but I just was not about to sit there and pay for it not only, but just go there and talk designer talk. Sometimes I feel like there could be a prestige that some people might have, like, hello, I&#8217;m art designer. I integrate things together. They use all the design words and I&#8217;m not very good at that. I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Yeah, make pictures.&#8221; So being in that environment isn&#8217;t something I would want to pay to do. So it was nice to be able to attend the virtual version because I never would have went otherwise. Yes, there were so many conferences and things I&#8217;ve never heard about that I got to hear about because it was virtual and people I got to meet because of that, which is nice to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. As I was going through your work, I saw your illustration work and your portrait work, which is beautiful, but your patterns, the patterns on your website are absolutely gorgeous. I love that you have in your bio, on your website, you mentioned that you&#8217;re an artist and designer depicting joy. What does it mean for you to depict joy in your work?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. So in terms of people, you&#8217;ll probably see that I draw a lot of black people. And one thing that makes me happy about black culture and just black people in general is just seeing us love the things that we love, however we love it. It just makes me really happy to see all the different facets and ways that black people just are. I get so excited. And I feel like when I draw that, that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m trying to convey just how excited I am to see black people as they are, doing whatever they like, looking as cool or as goofy or as happy as they are. I feel like that comes through with the people.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
And in terms of the patterns, I really like music. But when I hear music, I tend to see a lot of different shapes and colors just moving together. That&#8217;s how I see the song. Like me drawing those abstract patterns, it&#8217;s usually me listening to music and drawing whatever comes to mind. So just kind of like the happiness that comes from listening to music, that energy is something I&#8217;m trying to capture in the patterns. And I like for it to fit together kind of like different sounds fit together in a song, that&#8217;s how it shows up in the patterns.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And when you&#8217;re even doing these patterns, it also seems like you&#8217;re drawing from nature some too. I don&#8217;t know maybe if that was just the particular collection that you were doing, but I saw a lot of kind of tropical themes and leaves and stuff like that. It&#8217;s just very, very stunning work.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Thank you. Yeah, the tropical thing is I just love the way tropical scenery looks. I also think it&#8217;s nice, like all the different leaves and like patterns that you see within leaves, I think that&#8217;s nice as well, but also sometimes, if I draw too many triangles and circles, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Let me draw something that people can recognize.&#8221; So it ends up just being leaves and flowers for some reason. I&#8217;m not even a big flower person, it just ends up coming out, or I&#8217;ll just look up pictures of flowers. But yeah, I really love tropical weather and themes and stuff. So I just end up drawing it a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I have not met a Nigerian that didn&#8217;t like bright colors. So you&#8217;re definitely onto something there.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:35:22]. I love that. You&#8217;re right. You&#8217;re right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you get your creativity back if you are feeling uninspired, like say you hit a block in a project somewhere you&#8217;re working on something, what do you do to get that spark back?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
So when I am inspired, I have a bunch of hidden Pinterest boards. And then I also have a notebook where when I&#8217;m inspired, I just write down ideas of things that I think will be cool to make. So when I am feeling blocked or uninspired, I&#8217;ll look through that Pinterest board. One is just called Black, and it&#8217;s just black people, just random black people that I can find on Pinterest. It used to be really hard, but I saved so many pictures and looked at it that Pinterest has realized this girl likes to look here black people. So now my homepage has that.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
So I&#8217;ll either look at that Pinterest board, just kind of seeing people do stuff or I also have some with just colors or textures or shapes. I&#8217;ll just look through the Pinterest board or I&#8217;ll look through that list of ideas that I have. I&#8217;ll either do that or I&#8217;ll just take a break. Turn the thing off, turn the computer off, turn the iPad off, watch TV, play a video game, take a nap and then come back. Yeah. And then if there&#8217;s like a time crunch, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Well, honestly, think about the money.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Girl, do you want to get paid?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; So I just do it no matter what I&#8217;m like, okay. Just loosen up. Then I&#8217;ll take a five minute break, loosen up, get some water or something and then come back and just do it.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Or another thing I&#8217;ll do, sometimes I&#8217;m not a good singer, but I love to sing. So I&#8217;ll just turn on Spotify and then just force myself to sing along out loud as bad as it&#8217;s going to come out, just so to get my mind not overthinking it. And then things usually come out better. If I have, like my mind is focused on me singing, even though like, what notes? What notes am I hitting? So that helps me have a bit of more energy and looseness to the art that I&#8217;m making.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One thing that I would do when I was working on projects is I&#8217;d always build in at least a week into the sort of like project plan, because I mean, I think the expectation, certainly, I think from clients, but oftentimes, for us as freelances, as designers, the expectation is we&#8217;ll get the work and we&#8217;ll just be able to knock it out, like we&#8217;ll sit down and we&#8217;ll know what we do because the client has brought us on for our expertise. So we have to be the expert.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I mean, depending on how, if you set up a project rate or hourly rate or a day rate or whatever, sometimes clients will try to nickel and dime you to try to know like, well, how long did it take you to work on X, Y, Z, and blah, blah, blah? And I certainly early on in my freelance career, that was a mistake that I made. And then eventually, I switched things over either to like a project rate or I do like a day rate or something like that. I&#8217;d build in like a week of time because there&#8217;s no telling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And for me, it&#8217;s almost like creative insurance, like I may need it in the future if something happens, like what if I get sick? Or what if I just am not feeling it? And I can take that time out of the bank sort of because I&#8217;ve built it into the project and then I can, like if I take a day off and then decide to come back later and do it, then that way I&#8217;m not impacting the project because I built that time in there. It gives me permission to not have to be a machine when it comes to like creativity because sometimes the ideas flow and sometimes they just don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;ve certainly been at that place where you&#8217;re at, where you&#8217;re like, you just have to think about the money, like think about what this is going to do. And then you soldier on or you push through it. But yeah, that&#8217;s one thing that I would do is I just build in the time because the good thing is if you never use it, then you come out early and the client is happy. And then if you do use it, the client is still happy because you came out on time.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Right. That&#8217;s great. Because I learned in the design world as well, especially when I was at that media buying agency, it was an open office and there were only like eight of us. So sometimes I&#8217;ll work on stuff, they just be standing over my shoulder, &#8220;How long do you think it&#8217;ll take?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Please. Oh, I think it&#8217;ll take me a few hours rolling.&#8221; It wouldn&#8217;t. It would take me shorter than that, but I like to add in that buffer, just like you said, like if something happens, I can still turn it in when I said I could, but also giving myself that insurance, like you said, to make it.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
But in terms of the illustration projects now, those few hours turns into a couple of extra days or maybe an extra week, like you said. Yeah. Especially when people say they have a tight turnaround, things never are as tight as people want it to be, especially with getting revisions and just getting feedback, especially if there are a lot of cooks in the kitchen. So it is way better to add in more time for that kind of stuff in the beginning, like you said.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now when you were in school, when you were back at North Carolina State, let&#8217;s say, I think that was maybe probably around 10 years ago at this point, right?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where did you see yourself career-wise by this age where you&#8217;re at now?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Honestly, by the time I graduated, I was just like, &#8220;Am I cut out for this?&#8221; Honestly, because I thought, again, like when I was 18 entering college, I thought, okay, college is going to give me the roadmap. And by the time I am a senior, I&#8217;m going to know exactly what I want to do, how to get there and I&#8217;ll be able to get there. But that didn&#8217;t happen when I was a senior. I felt kind of similar to how I was as a freshman, like, what? Like, what am I doing? I need to find a job.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
So I mainly, the main goal I had, I was like, Keisha, please have a job, please have a job and an apartment that you can pay for with your job. I had very, very basic goals for myself, have a job that&#8217;s something related to design. Yeah, that was pretty much my only goal. I wanted, the idea of freelance sounded good, but then at that time, I had no idea how to do it. So it wasn&#8217;t even, it was more like a fantasy more than like me seeing myself there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I didn&#8217;t go to design school, but it is something that I&#8217;ve thought about in terms of like, do I need this in order to have this legitimacy for myself as a designer? Because I&#8217;ve been self-taught and I did a little bit of work at companies, like I worked for the State of Georgia for a while, I worked at AT&#038;T for a while. And then like, I really had just felt like, you know what? I got this, I could start my own studio and do this and really do it myself. And I&#8217;ve learned so much really just in the time that I had my studio doing things by myself, but they never really teach you entrepreneurship. I mean, again, I didn&#8217;t go to design school, but even with the work that I was doing, by the time I started my studio, I had a bachelor&#8217;s and a master&#8217;s degree and still didn&#8217;t know anything about freelancing. I was really either making it up as I went along or I was asking other freelances. I was really gaining this education while I was also trying to run my business.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Absolutely. Because in design school, in my senior year, we had this class that the description was literally, we&#8217;re going to prepare you to get a job. But when we actually took the class, they were like, &#8220;You need a website. Do you know what a website is? You can make websites on Squarespace.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Are you kidding me? This is my senior year and you&#8217;re teaching us that we need a website. Of course, we do. What are you talking about? How do you get a job? Please tell me what to put on my resume and how to get the people to actually hire me.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Even then, like being in design school didn&#8217;t make that difference. It&#8217;s almost like they&#8217;re out of touch with what was happening in the world. Like they got the art skills, but getting a job or even being an entrepreneur, that wasn&#8217;t even close to being thought about in any of my classes. I would have had to talk to alumni who are already doing it. And kind of like you said, they were figuring it out on their own or like having outside resources to figure that out. So I definitely don&#8217;t think going to design school will or not going to design school, you won&#8217;t really be missing out honestly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, by the time I really started figuring it out, I think I was about, I don&#8217;t know, I think maybe I was about two or three years into my studio and from just talking with other freelancers and picking up, because sometimes you just have to get, unfortunately, you just have to get burned a few times in business before you learn that lesson or whatever that particular lesson is. But I think by the time I was like, by the time I hit my fifth year, I had it down pat at that point, I knew about contracts and proposals and getting things done and everything just ran smoothly, but it took some time to get there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So yeah. I think now, because freelancing is an option for so many people, whether they do it either independently, like you&#8217;re doing, or if they do something like working via like a design marketplace, such as ThemeForest or Envato Elements or Envato Market, whatever the thing is that Envato has with all of the different websites and stuff, Fiverr, even those kinds of things, Upwork, there&#8217;s ways that you can use those tools to manage your business better, but it&#8217;s still, at the end of the day, it comes down to really knowing what those fundamentals are and knowing what works best for you. I think certainly, when I was doing business, there&#8217;s not an all-purpose solution for like being an entrepreneur. I wish there was. But once you learn what works for you in terms of cashflow and payments and client communication and everything, then you&#8217;ve cracked it, you&#8217;ve cracked the code pretty much.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. A lot of the stuff I&#8217;ve learned even about graphic design because NC State does have a graphic design major, but I majored in art and design, a lot of the stuff I learned about graphic design was just learning by doing. It ended up being like the jobs I had, more doing stuff for family and friends was really the stuff that prepared me for the different jobs. And I&#8217;m learning that that&#8217;s the same thing that&#8217;s happening with freelance as well, like the classes that I take, the people, the Instagram artists that I&#8217;ll DM or Instagram friends I have, I&#8217;ll DM, those things have been really helpful. And also, like you said, being burnt, having bad clients, that helps me set better boundaries for future clients, like knowing what to do. So yeah, that&#8217;s definitely something I&#8217;m in the process of right now. I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to the part where everything runs itself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;ll get there probably I think sooner than you expect. Before you know it, it&#8217;ll just flow. It&#8217;s sort of like a&#8230; I mean, you watch anime, it&#8217;s like the Avatar State. Eventually, you&#8217;ll be able to just invoke it and you&#8217;ll be good.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Awesome. Avatar is one of my favorite shows. So I love that you said the Avatar State.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are you obsessed with at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Speaking of anime, so I&#8217;m watching this anime called Fruits Basket. It&#8217;s a silly premise. When it&#8217;s like, if you hug someone of the opposite gender, they will turn into Zodiac animal, so like the Year of the Horse, or a cat, rat, like things like that. But you end up finding out everyone has these crazy backstories and there&#8217;s this whole curse and things like that. So I&#8217;ve just been binge-watching that show basically, because I&#8217;m so curious to see what&#8217;s happening. Other than that, I&#8217;ve been playing a video game called Mario &#038; Sonic at The Olympic Games for 2020. I&#8217;ve just been going through the story mode. There was one, it&#8217;s the triple jump and I keep getting disqualified. So I got mad and turned it off, but I still think about it because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to win.&#8221; Yeah. I would say those two things.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Also, I have a cat. I&#8217;ve never had a pet before, but I got one a few months ago, honestly, off the strength of seeing other black people on social media have cats and they seem to enjoy it. And I always wanted a cat. So I ended up getting one. So I spend a lot of time peeking over the couch, seeing what she&#8217;s doing or looking for her around the house and just smiling really big. She gets annoyed, but I think she&#8217;s used to it. I would say I&#8217;m pretty obsessed with her.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Do you have like a dream project that you would love to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a great question. I would say the only dream project I had, I got to do it last year. So I got to illustrate a deck of playing cards and I pretty much did the art direction for the whole thing. So you mentioned the tropical idea, there was a running idea I had for a long time of joining black people in the tropical space, kind of like an oasis, a place where they could freely celebrate themselves without all the isms in the world that black people carry. So I pretty much made the deck around that and got the job black people being happy or silly in that tropical environment. And that was something I really enjoy doing. If I think of like a future project, it would be a similar thing, but in a different format. I haven&#8217;t figured that out yet, but definitely enjoyed doing that deck of cards, but I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s like a book or like a coffee book or like a storybook, but that&#8217;s kind of like something that I&#8217;m juggling in my head right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is the best advice that you&#8217;ve ever been given regarding what you do as an illustrator?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Interestingly enough, I would say the best advice I have is more of like a you as a person. So like, not finding your identity in the work that you do, you&#8217;re more than the work that you do. You are enough as you are. Like those kinds of things I&#8217;ve seen have made the biggest difference for me. Yeah, a lot of times the artsy-fartsy, mumbo-jumbo, it just slides off of me. I&#8217;m just like, this sounds, but when I draw, what does that mean? So hearing things like, I&#8217;m more than the art that I make is very freeing for me to be able to just have fun with it and do stuff that I like. And I don&#8217;t have to judge myself based on how well I drew today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I can see how that, I mean, well, one, I see that is good advice just in general, like, make sure that you don&#8217;t get too caught up in the work, but also realize that you put your own identity into everything that you do as well.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next like five years? Like this whole pandemic craziness is over with, it&#8217;s 20, what? 2026. What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Honestly, I haven&#8217;t thought that far ahead. I was like, &#8220;Will the world still be turning at that time?&#8221; I think it would be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hope so.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
You&#8217;re right. Me too. Honestly, I hope I&#8217;ll be doing bigger projects, projects I&#8217;m really excited about. I&#8217;m enjoying the projects that I&#8217;m doing right now. So more, just like an extension of the kinds of things I&#8217;m doing right now getting to illustrate different people, doing things, really hoping to get into the Children&#8217;s Book World, be able to illustrate them to children&#8217;s books. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;m looking forward to. And also, I want to get my patterns onto products. So one thing I&#8217;m hoping to do also in five years is to have my products on things. Yeah. More of like, just like all the different ways I can get my work out there, either on products or online in different formats. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;m hoping will happen, just as I grow and do things and get better at art, have it just spread onto different formats as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything that you&#8217;re doing online?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. So you can find my work on my website, which is keishaokafor.com, O-K-A-F-O-R. You can also find me on social media on Twitter and Instagram, mostly Instagram @keishaoak, oak as in oak tree, O-A-K. The reason why it&#8217;s like that is just so you know how to pronounce Okafor. But yeah, that&#8217;s pretty much where I&#8217;m at, Instagram, Twitter and my website.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Keisha Okafor, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I have to say, I just love how joyful and colorful and vibrant your work is. Like I mentioned, when I discovered you from the work that you did at YouTube, I was just looking at your website, like, this is so fun. And I have to say that it&#8217;s rare to see a designer put that sort of joy into their work, but I am really excited to see what sort of work you&#8217;ll be doing after this interview, after people get a chance to really see your work, because I feel like this sort of vibrancy and joy in life is what we need right now. We need to be seeing more of this everywhere. And so I&#8217;m excited for people to really learn more about you and learn more about your work. And yeah, just thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Thank you for having me. I am hope, really excited for people to see my work too. And I really appreciate all your kind words. Yeah, I definitely, I&#8217;m just like, if I&#8217;m going to draw, I&#8217;m going to have fun with it and I want everyone else to have fun with it too. So definitely excited to see where it all goes.</p>

<p>When I asked Napoleon Wright II to describe what he does, he gave me a list of titles &#8212; animator, videographer, filmmaker, musician, designer, etc. Needless to say, he&#8217;s brimming with creative ability, and that always makes for a great interview.</p>
<p>We started off talking about the Raleigh creative scene, and from there went into how Napoleon first got into design, the creation of his design company <a href="http://pan-ii.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Pan II Creative</a>, as well as his forays into music. This industry moves fast, and a creative like Napoleon has just what it takes to adapt and thrive. Enjoy the interview!</p>
