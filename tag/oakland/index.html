Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>As we wind down this year&#8217;s Black History Month (and our anniversary month &#8212; 11 years!), we&#8217;ve got a super-sized episode with someone I&#8217;ve wanted to have on the podcast for a long time &#8212; the one and only Mike Nicholls. Mike is an award-winning storyteller with deep roots in hip-hop culture and design, and is probably most well-known for creating <a href="https://www.thisisumber.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Umber</a> &#8212; the design and culture magazine that highlights the global perspectives of Black people and POC from around the world.</p>
<p>Mike talked about how his love for magazines inspired him to create Umber, and shared some of the triumphs and challenges he&#8217;s faced over the years as the brand has evolved from a magazine into a media platform. He also spoke about his time as a designer in Atlanta, Philly, and Chicago, how Oakland inspires his work, and talked about how being a designer and a hip-hop artist helps keep his artistic integrity intact.</p>
<p>For Mike, his creative expression is about more than just making ends meet ‚Äî it‚Äôs about creating with a purpose and about telling stories that resonate on a deeper level and embrace the authenticity of Black and brown experiences!</p>

<p>December is a good time to reflect and take stock of the year, and that&#8217;s the basis of my conversation with this week&#8217;s guest Jonathan Robinson. Jonathan is a creative powerhouse &#8212; a writer, a filmmaker, and a director, just to start &#8212; who&#8217;s currently on a personal journey of self-discovery.</p>
<p>We started off doing a bit of a recap of the past year, and Jonathan shed some light on what creative and experiential producers do and how he came into those titles through his work in the advertising industry. He also talked about working with AI and VR, and spoke about how his time spent at Facebook and Twitter helped shape him into his current calling as a storyteller.</p>
<p>For Jonathan, chasing his passions and connecting with other people are what drives him. When you look back at this year, what&#8217;s been your driving force?</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>My name is Jonathan Robinson, and I am a creative producer, director, and writer, supporting all kinds of interactive experiences, products, and bringing stories to life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>When you look back at this year, at 2023, how would you describe it? Like, how&#8217;s it been for you?</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a little bit of a roller coaster, I think. I kind of liken it to making a loop around a racetrack. Things feel very familiar. But also, the urgency of how I&#8217;m trying to sort of move up in the race is starting to set in. I started the year still very much in a sort of personal sabbatical, working on a few writing projects and a VR concept which was really fulfilling, but also because these projects were very personal and tied to my personal experiences, my family history. I was doing a lot of digging up sort of latent emotional baggage and opening up wounds that I didn&#8217;t know were there. Add to that sort of the reality of living in capitalism and needing to pay your bills, trying to balance how to leverage the skills and the experience that I&#8217;ve had over the last close to 15 years working as a producer to generate some income without necessarily going back to the kind of soul crushing work that it felt like I left quite intentionally. I&#8217;ve done a little bit of contract work to pay the bills, but in doing so have been reminded why I left in the first place.</p>
<p>I think if anything, I feel like I went on a sort of condensed loop of what the past four or five years of my journey has been just in this one year. I think that&#8217;s given me a renewed clarity and motivation to continue in this sort of uncomfortable, unfamiliar path towards what I think I know I want.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a very diplomatic answer.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s me. I&#8217;m a producer by trade and also a little bit by personality. So always trying to find the middle ground that moves us closer to an objective.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. How are you making time for joy these days?</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>One of those things is really starting to take some of these more administrative skills that I&#8217;ve used in my professional life and trying to apply them to the emotional maturity, work and growth that I&#8217;ve experienced over the last couple of years. I had a moment of I mean, as most of us did during the pandemic of real clarity and understanding that I was not investing nearly enough time and energy into my relationships as I was into my career. And so, from there I started to just try to apply some of that structure that existed in my career that created that focus and apply that to relationships. It sounds, like, very academic or clinical, but I have a standing call with my best friend every Friday or excuse me, every other Friday when we talk for about two or three hours on the phone. I have standing dates with a couple of other friends either on a weekly or monthly basis just to make sure that we have a touch point. And it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re only ever talking during these times. But I&#8217;ve found that when you have that consistency, it makes it so much easier to seek out these connections in between. And I think for myself, I&#8217;m kind of a self-isolating personality when I don&#8217;t have the sort of structure and pressure to show up if someone is not directly in my vicinity.</p>
<p>Living here in Oakland, I actually don&#8217;t have most of my closest friends in the area. They&#8217;re either in New York or in Southern California or in Europe. And so, it does take a little bit more effort on my part to make sure that those relationships are solid and are being fed. But I&#8217;ve really enjoyed seeing that growth and the ways in which it&#8217;s made me less in my head about reaching out and connecting with people. Even if it&#8217;s just something as silly as sending a meme or a photo of something ridiculous that I just saw while I was crossing the street. Yeah, I mean, add to like trying to make sure that I get out of the house and have in-person community. I&#8217;ve been attending this writing group here in Oakland, at Wolfpack Studios, a little studio in downtown Oakland. And it&#8217;s just maybe about anywhere between six to twelve of us once a month.</p>
<p>And we get together for about two hours, two to three hours, to go through a couple of prompts. We start with haikus and some short story prompts. Folks are reading their poetry and rapping or they&#8217;re not writers at all and they just wanted to show up and have a good time. But I&#8217;ve found some really cool people who just being able to express yourself in a room of other people who are willing to express themselves and open up in that way, I think, has been really refreshing and really rewarding for my own personal work. So that&#8217;s kind of the variety.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&#8217;s really good to still try to keep those lines of communication open. I know when the pandemic first started, that was kind of a thing a lot of people tried to do, at least through Zoom or through other types of telecommunications type software. Just like check in, see how things are going, et cetera. But now I don&#8217;t want to say we&#8217;re a few years out from the Pandemic, but certainly the world has gotten back to its normal state. Well, I don&#8217;t want to say normal. You know what I mean. We&#8217;ve started.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>Yes, I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve pushed past that restrictive period, and I think some people have moved past it, some people haven&#8217;t. I still feel like it&#8217;s a very sort of OD and touchy time in terms of communication. So, I like that you&#8217;re making those efforts to actually keep in touch and keep those lines of communication open because it can be so easy, especially if they don&#8217;t live in the same city as you. It&#8217;s so easy for those to just die on the vine.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>2024 is right around the corner. Have you thought about what you want to accomplish next year?</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>I have, and as I said before, it is uncomfortable and unfamiliar, but I&#8217;m excited. I am going to be taking a renewed focus on these creative projects that I started about a year and a half ago. I&#8217;m working on a sci-fi script and a couple of short stories that I want to shoot and preparing for a push to either potentially go to a film school later in the year and figure out how to kick start a filmmaking career. So that&#8217;s like one track. But on the other end of the spectrum is exploring what I describe as more experiential work, things that involve newer technologies like artificial intelligence and VR. There are a couple of artists that are really interesting in this space, one of which is a good friend who I used to work with in New York. Their name is Sougwen Chung, and they do essentially a lot of collaborative performances where they are generating art along with their artificial intelligence and robotics companions that they have built and programmed over the last, I think, twelve years now. And so, I&#8217;m very excited to find ways to replicate that same kind of work, as well as find ways to collaborate with folks in that space, including Sougwen themselves.</p>
<p>But in terms of what all of that looks know, I can&#8217;t really tell, really. I grew up in the church, so it&#8217;s really easy for this phrase to come to mind, but I am literally walking by faith and not by sight. I am just putting 1ft in front of the other and juggling the variables and catching the consequences, which I mean, I guess is what it means to be a producer. So, I&#8217;ve had a lot of practice in that space dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty. But it&#8217;s a lot easier to do that when you have conviction, which I think has been the theme that is coalescing towards the end of this year in terms of how I want to approach 2024. It&#8217;s with conviction. I don&#8217;t need to know everything. I don&#8217;t need to have everything absolutely planned out; I don&#8217;t need to know how everything is going to work out.</p>
<p>But I do have to walk with a sort of full body yes and a confidence that is grounded in purpose. And that really is what conviction is. So that&#8217;s what my 2024 looks like. Walking into the unknown, sure footed.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I like that. I like that a lot. That&#8217;s funny that you also kind of tied that back into the work in a way about like, this is what it means to be a producer, which I want to unpack a little bit later now when I do my research and everything to try to find out more about the guest. And you alluded to this a bit earlier, kind of being on this personal journey. What brought that on?</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>I think when I look back at it, and in hindsight, it started at the end of 2017-ish, basically when I started at Facebook. Up until this point, I had been working in New York in the advertising field. I&#8217;d bounced around between a couple of different agencies, but at that point I was around three years into my second stint at a production company called The Mill, and essentially being like one of two senior producers in their experiential and interactive division, which they had just started to build back up. I got this opportunity to work at Facebook, and the job was in London. So, I&#8217;d be leaving the country to live outside of the country for the first time since I was like three years old when I was in Costa Rica. And so, I was really excited about that opportunity. This is also 2017, so if we think back to where the world was sort of socio-politically, an opportunity to work at a place like Facebook is a sort of double-edged sword. High impact, massive reach, and you&#8217;re working on a product that touches almost half of the people on the planet in one way or another.</p>
<p>But at the time, we were also starting to discover, more concretely anyway, that some of the ways in which that impact was landing in people&#8217;s lives was actually quite harmful, and that maybe something actually could have been done about that, but simply wasn&#8217;t. So, I threw myself into that opportunity with optimism and a lot of youthful vigor. But I think the combination of one understanding the relative impact of one or even a couple hundred individuals in a corporation that has 70,000 employees and a global reach, it makes for a quite Sisyphean task, I think, is the word. Pushing that boulder up the hill every day, and also living in London, moving there without any friends and family. And all of these things sort of coincided and combined with the point in my life that I was at, and I fell into a pretty deep depression. And then I learned the first rule of working in tech, and that is that every six to eight months there&#8217;ll be a reorg. And I was reorged out of my role and needed to find a new one. And I had one of two options: stay in London and find a team within the Facebook ecosystem that could use my skills so that I could stay in London or move to the bay area for this particular team that had headcount.</p>
<p>And they were like, we&#8217;ll take you on, we want to have you, but it means you got to move back to the states. And with option two, came back to the states, and just in time for about a year&#8217;s worth of soaking up the benefits of this northern California climate and nature and all of the amazing culture of Oakland right before the pandemic, and sort of back in isolation. That isolation again just sort of brought to the forefront the struggle I was having between the kind of impact I wanted to have in a company like Facebook and the kind of impact that I was actually having and whether or not that was commiserate or whether or not I could square that with the negative impact that the company was having, at least from my perspective. And so you&#8217;re sitting in a studio by yourself all day for months on end, as a lot of us know, and it leads to a lot of introspection. I was spending a lot of time in therapy, actually. I had just started therapy right before the pandemic started, which was amazing timing, but was also spending a lot of time actually talking to my mother about her own sort of personal journey and the spiritual journey that she was on at the time. We started talking about different belief systems. And she really surprised me by bringing up IFA and this sort of African indigenous spiritual frameworks of West Africa, specifically the Yoruba.</p>
<p>And I started to dig into some of these things and do a little bit of research on my own. And she invited me to a weekly class, weekly zoom with someone who was going to sort of run through a curriculum to explain the basics of the framework. And without getting into the details of the spiritual beliefs themselves, I think what was most impactful about that was this underlying system that was about understanding your place within this particular life, this place and time that we exist. And how it connects to our ancestors, the people who came before us, the people around us, and the unseen forces that are at play, whether that be natural forces, societal forces, technological forces. And it really started to give me almost like a narrative framework to be able to investigate my life and see what was working and what wasn&#8217;t, what did I want to change. And that&#8217;s kind of how I got to this place of I don&#8217;t think working in tech is the thing for me. I&#8217;m not knocking it for anybody who does want to. I do think the work is incredibly important for all of the reasons that I left.</p>
<p>But it became very clear that my path, my purpose is in storytelling and finding ways to weave narratives that can help us investigate the relationship between what we see in front of us and what we feel like we experience as reality and those unseen forces, the parts of reality that are just outside of our perception and how to sort of marry the two, make them compatible and then create a better reality. Because I do think that that is what we are here for, to leave the world a better place than we found it. And we can&#8217;t really do that if we&#8217;re not honest about who we are and the world that we live in and what kind of world that we want. So, yeah, long winded answer to say, that&#8217;s how I got here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I was going to say some of those things that you mentioned. I mean, 100% mirror, I think, what a lot of people might be feeling about working in tech, I think just in general, a couple of months ago, we had Maya Gold Robinson on the show. And I&#8217;ve known Maya for a long time. I knew her since she was a product designer in Chicago, and since then she has‚Ä¶actually she&#8217;s also worked at Facebook. She also worked at Twitter. She created‚Ä¶ </p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I love Maya. She&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>You did? Okay, cool. Yeah. But she was talking about how right now she&#8217;s also sort of taking this break and being like, I&#8217;m kind of done with tech right now. I&#8217;m going to take a year; I&#8217;m going to spend it with my family and just sort of figure out what these next steps are. I think what we&#8217;re seeing with tech, and I want to talk a little bit more about this kind of creative journey because I feel like part of this personal journey you went, underwent deals also with you as a creative because you said you emerged talking about storytelling. But I feel like we&#8217;re starting to see that tech is not all it&#8217;s cracked up to mean. Well, yeah, surprise, right? But I think the way and I mentioned this in the interview with Maya, I was like it kind of felt like in some way we were kind of sold like a false bill of goods about tech, about how it is going to offer you this economic prosperity and these opportunities to be on these projects that can change the world. Especially for large tech companies. But then you get in there and you&#8217;re subject to so many other isms and like you said, professional reorgs and things like that.</p>
<p>And it can be easy to feel like a cog in the machine and that your work doesn&#8217;t really have the impact that maybe you were told it does.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. And it&#8217;s not necessarily that any of those things were completely untrue. You absolutely can work on these projects that have massive impact and change the world and be financially lucrative, even for yourself as an individual, as much as it is often understood that most of that financial impact is going to go to somebody else sitting in a bigger office. But that doesn&#8217;t actually always balance out with all of those other things you mentioned. The reorgs, the isms, the sort of cog in the machine feeling that you get when you work on something diligently and over long extended hours with a massive team and you spent two to six months on something and then all of a sudden somebody decides that no one will ever see it, period. Yeah, that gets old actually rather quickly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Very quickly. Absolutely very quickly. I&#8217;m thinking of my own journey. The last place that I worked at was this tech startup based out of San Francisco, and I came on under the title Creative Strategist. Creative Strategist was like a title. It&#8217;s funny you mentioned the Pandemic, because during the Pandemic, I was also thinking of, like well, what do I really call myself? Because prior to getting I don&#8217;t want to say prior to getting into tech, but prior to working for the startup that I worked at at the time, I had my own business, still have the business, but back then I had a staff of nine people. They were designers, developers. I was kind of doing creative work with Mailchimp and WordPress and all this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But then you get into a startup in these companies and the startup I was at at the time, I changed titles maybe about six different times as the company grew. And so, each time that title changed, I don&#8217;t know if it really reflected what it is that I really do. It sort of just puts you in a bit of a box in a way. Like I went from being a content marketer to a design communications lead, to marketing lead, to head of media. And I think the last title I had was like senior Creative strategist because it felt right. It was like, yes, I know the creative part, but I also know the business part and I can sort of bring these two things together in a way.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>But what I basically was doing, and this kind of alludes, I think, a bit to your story is like, I basically was taking creative projects that the company wanted to do and making them happen, which is a producer type of thing, which back then, I didn&#8217;t really think that that&#8217;s what I did. Or at least that I didn&#8217;t associate that with what I did. But the last place I worked; we made a print magazine. We made a print and an online magazine. And I mean, I threw everything into it because I&#8217;ve always wanted to do a magazine. I grew up on magazines and we got two issues out the door, really. We only got one issue out the door.</p>
<p>The second one came after they laid off the entire team. But it was a quarterly magazine. I put so much into it, the structure. I&#8217;d sent out this weekly hot sheet to let people know when assignments were due. And these are the artists that are working on certain visuals and all this sort of stuff and had a plan for at least a six-issue run. And these are the themes that we&#8217;re going to talk about. And these are the writers that I want to bring in. And we did the first one with great success, and we were leading up to the second one.</p>
<p>The second issue was at the printer. Like it was set to go out a week from then. And then they laid us all off because they invited us to like a slack group called Goodbye and we&#8217;re like, Wait a minute, what? Wow. Invited us to a slack group called #goodbye. And I think I started my workday at eight and by noon I was unemployed. It was just like that, and I was so pissed off because it didn&#8217;t give me enough time to really pull together all my stuff. But it&#8217;s like, yeah, you spend so much time putting something together, and then it never sees the light of day. We were going to do this issue on Web3, and I found a Black Web3 ethicist.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay? Brought them on as, like, a guest editor-in-chief, and we curated the entire magazine for the point of view we wanted to have. It will never see the light of day.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s crazy. This is unsustainable. Absolutely unsustainable. Yeah. I think we can only get, like, one or two of those experiences before we&#8217;re like, what are we doing this for?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ve had three of them since the pandemic started. I had one in 2020. in 2021, and one last year. And yeah, it wears on you in such an insidious way where you know that you can do great work because you know that what you&#8217;re capable of, but then it&#8217;s like, does it have value in this, I don&#8217;t know, tech system that I&#8217;m a part of? It&#8217;s so weird.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I really appreciate that particular phrasing. Does it have value in this ecosystem that I exist in? I think that was the turning point in at least my therapy practice that helped me decide, okay, I need to leave. Or at the very least, I need to change how I approach this space and show up in this space, because I don&#8217;t have the same value system as these people do. I&#8217;m being evaluated on a completely different criteria than I evaluate myself. I&#8217;m disappointed and feeling upset because I keep trying to make their value system mesh with mine. They don&#8217;t need to. They don&#8217;t need to.</p>
<p>I step into this space. I understand that these are the criteria, these are the objectives, these are the responsibilities that I have. So, I&#8217;ll do those things. But I think I may be misremembering this secondhand quote, but I believe it was Toni Morrison talking about her first job and how her father told her, listen, you work over there. Those people are not your family. You go there, you get your money, and then you come home. And that is how she approached every job that wasn&#8217;t her personal projects. And that&#8217;s kind of the mindset I had to switch into that helped me get to the place of actually, I don&#8217;t think I want to keep showing up here at all.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s tough, because with these tech companies, we might as well just keep talking about it, but we&#8217;re talking about these tech companies, and the first thing that they really try to sell you on is like, we&#8217;re like a family. This is like a family thing. And even that can be super loaded, especially if you don&#8217;t come from a great family environment that could turn you off if they&#8217;re like, Wait a minute. I actually don&#8217;t fuck my family like that. So, I don&#8217;t know. This is like a thing that I want, but it sort of builds this in this sort of period of introspection, you start to wonder if the work you do is even valued by this industry. So maybe what I do is better suited for media than for tech or maybe it&#8217;s better suited for nonprofits than for tech. Like something where that&#8217;s right, the abilities that I have can be used towards a greater good that&#8217;s not about KPIs and personal performance plans and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly right. I think that language that they sort of I mean, it&#8217;s not just language, it&#8217;s a whole sideshow experience that they sort of bombard you with as you step into these environments where they tell you, yes, we&#8217;re all family. This company is yours; no problem is someone else&#8217;s problem. You can have all the impact that you can possibly dream of if you just put together an idea and work hard to make it happen. All of those things. And they talk about the values that they have of showing up as your authentic self, whatever that means, and radical honesty and being collaborative and caring about the humans that we serve, our customers, our users, or whatever a new term they decide to use to clean up the fact that actually they&#8217;re talking about the people they make money off of. All of that sort of sets this context where you can very quickly forget that you&#8217;re in a corporation. Like you&#8217;re working at a place that is an equivalent size and scale of an ExxonMobil.</p>
<p>And maybe if you were working at AT&#038;T, you wouldn&#8217;t necessarily think too much about the coffee and the cereal and the food courts and all of the amenities and how it does actually feel very comfortable and like a family. And so, it&#8217;s easier to remember that you work for a corporation. I think because of the way that some of these tech companies decorate their culture, the aesthetics of their culture obscure that reality. That it is very much a corporate culture where capital and profit reign supreme. And as much as they might say that they want to prioritize the betterment of humanity, they will always make sure that they run that language by legal so that they can always prioritize their dollars in that final hour. Yeah. And just sort of unpacking all of that takes some time and it takes some introspection. You really do have to ask yourself, is this company mine? Do my values actually align with the stated values of the company? And then are those values being practiced in the day to day see those values in the impact that we mean? I think that&#8217;s difficult enough to ask of yourself, but it is a necessary first step so that you can ask it of the companies that you work for.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Right at this point I&#8217;m like Marshawn Lynch. I&#8217;m just showing. Up so I don&#8217;t get fined.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s it. That is it. I&#8217;m just here so I don&#8217;t get fined. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I worked for AT&#038;T. I worked for AT&#038;T for almost two and a half years. This was back in two thousand‚Ä¶from 2006 to 2008, I worked there. And at the time their internal sort of slogan was ‚ÄúShaping Human Capital,‚Äù which is like, okay, like, you walk into the building, and you have this big, huge banner ‚Äì shaping human capital. And I mean, the two and a half years I worked there were grueling not so much in an emotional way, but it&#8217;s like it wore on me in such a way that it was affecting me physically and I had to leave.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And that&#8217;s when I left and started my own business. And I feel like that&#8217;s really when I started to find myself and my career and my purpose is when I left. And the only reason I sort of got back in, nine years later, honestly, was because the market had changed and the kind of work that I was doing with my studio just wasn&#8217;t as profitable as it was before. And I wanted more stability because working for yourself is great, but working for yourself can be a real roller coaster, especially because we started in the middle of a recession and it&#8217;s not very easy to try to make the money that you need to pay your bills and just sort of exist in this capitalist society.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And I think things are different now, but not necessarily better because what&#8217;s happened is a lot of these tech startups are picking the worst parts of corporate America and wrapping them in this sort of aesthetic, as you mentioned, to make it seem like, oh, it&#8217;s going to be fun and foosball tables and beer on Fridays and stuff like that. Kristy Tillman, who I&#8217;ve had on the show before, she&#8217;s a friend of mine and I know she once talked about filters. No, what&#8217;d she say? Perks as filters. So, like, a lot of companies will list all these different perks, and the perks are fairly similar among companies of a certain size that have reached a certain level of funding. It&#8217;s like unlimited PTO. And this sounds great if you&#8217;re coming from a place where you had to fight and claw for every day off that you had to get ‚Äì unlimited PTO sounds great.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>But then that can also be a filter for the fact that the internal culture will overwork you so much that you will feel guilty for utilizing those days and often get penalized for using those days even if they&#8217;re not in an egregious manner. I mean, this especially happened during the pandemic with remote stuff. Like it&#8217;s remote, you can work from anywhere. And some people took advantage of that. Actually, at the last place that I worked, I&#8217;m not going to name where, but people can search and find there were some people that basically traveled every month, and it was remote and so they could work from anywhere. And they&#8217;re like, oh, well, if I can work from anywhere, I&#8217;m just going to backpack through Europe. That sounds nice, but then what happens is that builds enmity with the people that don&#8217;t backpack through Europe or can&#8217;t just pick up and leave and go workplaces. And so even though the company had that as a perk of working there, they ended up penalizing this person for it.</p>
<p>And they were just sort of like, ‚ÄúI don&#8217;t understand. I&#8217;m still getting my work done. I&#8217;m going between times, nothing is happening, and I&#8217;m getting penalized for what I do outside of work in this way.‚Äù</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Divesting from all of this is, I feel, like the smartest move to try to make, especially with what we&#8217;ve seen in the past couple of years with tech layoffs, unionization efforts and really the rise of AI and these new technology things. I mean, we&#8217;re talking now just fresh off of the writers‚Ä¶not the writer‚Äôs strike, the actor‚Äôs strike, just ended. But what we&#8217;ve seen this year, if we look back through the whole year, we&#8217;ve seen three major unions have strikes and win: the writers, the auto workers, and now the actors. And so, what does that mean now for the future of work in this country? Especially now that we see that these efforts can work? We can lobby together and have better, more holistic workplaces and things like that. I don&#8217;t know. I worked at a place where we unionized in 2020 and they laid us off three months later. So, I don&#8217;t know if this means now there&#8217;s more power that exists.</p>
<p>I feel like I&#8217;m rambling a little bit, but no, a lot of things are changing in a lot of different ways right now. And I think if you&#8217;re a creative person, it can be tough to kind of find your anchor amidst all this.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>Exactly. Yeah, exactly. And you touched on a lot of different ways in which the currents of society, or at least the trends that society is experiencing, all of the different ways that they sort of knock us around as creatives trying to find our footing. But I do think at the same time, those currents, those trends, those forces, they can help us understand some of the different forces at play on the inside of us so that we can find what movements to attach ourselves to or to move in parallel with that can help us figure out what&#8217;s going to be right for ourselves as much as all of this promise of tech was a great way for a lot of us to move up the sort of economic ladder in ways that other folks in our families or previous generations were unable to or barred from. At the same time, we also see that just because you get higher up the ladder doesn&#8217;t mean the guy at the top of the pyramid isn&#8217;t going to kick this ladder off in order to save a couple of dollars. You can make all of the cool stuff in the world, but if this company needs to ensure that its profit margins look a certain way so that their shareholders are going to be happy, then you&#8217;ll find out exactly how they feel about family, so to speak, and you&#8217;ll be gone.</p>
<p>And these technologies that we created together out of an enthusiasm in a more optimistic sense for the possibilities and all of the different solutions that we could find within these technologies. They are at the same time because they are owned by people at the top who don&#8217;t necessarily have our best interest in mind and are specifically incentivized to care more about how much money shareholders are making than how well our lives are impacted. We see those technologies being turned against us and at the same time to the point of these different unions recently being victorious over some of those forces. We can see that when we look to each other&#8217;s humanity and find the common cause and stand in solidarity with the prioritization of the human aspect of our work that we are not capital, we are humans and stand firm in those convictions. We can quite literally face giants and move mountains. But it is still difficult for every actor‚Äôs union or writers‚Äô union or the auto workers union. We have, to your point, examples of unionizing and immediately finding yourself out of work or all of the different ways that unions have been combated in the tech industry or in the visual effects industry and the advertising industry, all of which I&#8217;ve had some experience working in. And I see how much the struggles of these writers, these actors, mirror exactly what so many of us have experienced both in tech, in advertising, in visual effects and production.</p>
<p>We just haven&#8217;t been able to make some of those en masse movements last long enough to make that impact. But that doesn&#8217;t mean we shouldn&#8217;t keep trying.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>No, we definitely should keep trying and I think because we&#8217;re seeing how it&#8217;s worked on, again, this very large level like in the entertainment industry or in the auto industry, I think it&#8217;s given people more visibility into it and honestly, it&#8217;s giving people more knowledge. It&#8217;s amazing when we were back, when we were trying to unionize at Glitch, it was amazing how many people had no experience about unions and what they were except like negative talking points. And it&#8217;s like you do realize that some of the perks that you have are the direct results of unionization in the past. Like the eight-hour workday.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>These things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Came because people unionized in the past. So, you wouldn&#8217;t have to work 12,13, 14 hours a day or whatever. But yeah, we&#8217;re starting to see, I think the tide shifted a little bit. I&#8217;m curious though, for you where did this, and if I can call it this, this love for creating and producing and storytelling. Where did this come from? Did this come from you growing up, or‚Ä¶tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I&#8217;ve always been fascinated with stories from a sort of consumption perspective. My mom was trained as a teacher and sort of raised me with a strong emphasis on traditional education. So, I was always reading something. I mean, I had to do book reports over summer break. When I would finish my homework too fast, she would create more curriculum for me to do. I was getting in trouble for talking too much in class, and the teacher said, well, he finishes his work, and then he starts talking to the other students, and that&#8217;s disruptive. So, she made an agreement with the teacher to create an entire curriculum that she would grade that would be included as part of my grade.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow. Mama didn&#8217;t play!</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>No, not at all. So, I was constantly reading and consuming stories, and I&#8217;ve always been a deeply curious individual. I don&#8217;t want to just know what happened or even how it happened. I also want to understand why it happened. And I think all of that extra emphasis on critical thinking, on reading analysis, and on doing your own research and citing your sources sort of built this almost like programming in my brain to understand stories, both from a surface level as an entertainment experience, but also on a deeper level as a tool for communicating information and actually being able to sort of transcribe experiences from one person to another without having to directly live through them. The thing that was included in the story. So, I&#8217;ve always sort of had that perspective on storytelling to a certain point. I graduated high school and was like, I want to be a comic book artist.</p>
<p>The dream was to work at Marvel, maybe work on an X-Men or Spider-Man comic. And after some experience in an art school, the now defunct Art Institute of Las Vegas very quickly understood that I wasn&#8217;t going to get the kind of education that I needed from that particular place and moved to New. York, just because I felt like that was my Mecca, the place that had been calling to me, where I was going to figure it all out, and quite literally stumbled into a career in advertising as a producer. I was on my girlfriend&#8217;s couch trying to figure out how I was going to pay rent the next month, found a Craigslist ad for a project manager intern, and my only question in the interview was, what&#8217;s a project manager? And how can you be a manager and an intern at the same time? That experience really opened up an entire world of possibilities. I didn&#8217;t realize that there were so many creative individuals with stable, well-paying jobs. Even if you are working 12 hours a day, and maybe more than that, sometimes you could make websites and flash banners and mobile apps, and one job leads to another. And I think the place that really blew the doors open on the possibilities was The Mill. Working there was quite a privilege in both stints that I was there.</p>
<p>The first time they were starting what they called their Mill digital team. And the whole idea was around. The mill is traditionally a VFX studio. They do all of the‚Ä¶their whole little tagline is like, ‚Äúif you watch the Super Bowl, at least two out of every three commercials that you saw, The Mill touched in one way or another.‚Äù But they were trying to move into this more digital, out of home experiential field that was starting to pop up at the time. And I got to work with a really incredible dream team of creative and technically excellent individuals who sort of took me under their wing as this young 22-year-old little idiot who didn&#8217;t know anything but would follow instructions and ask as many questions as came to mind. And they exposed me to the possibilities of what you can do with a serviceable, knowledge of available technology and a strong creative vision. Add to that the third leg of the stool, some business sense and tact to be able to convince folks to pay for those things, and you got yourself a pretty promising path for making some cool things and getting paid to do that.</p>
<p>But working there meant being able to, on the one hand, work with animators who typically did 3D animation for visual effects in like a Gillette commercial and trying to explain to them how you&#8217;re going to turn a couple of data sets into a particle visualization that replicates the visuals of the sort of mackerels and tuna form of something like a school. Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Fish or something like that. Yeah, that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>Trying to convince these folks to do things with their expertise and their most familiar tools that they had never been asked to do. And then also trying to tell stories with these data points, because, again, we&#8217;re in the advertising and marketing field, so everybody&#8217;s got a narrative. And so that experience really helped to shape the possibilities of how I could connect my love of stories and the depths of what stories mean. Not just the what or the how, but the why with these new emerging technologies and the deep institutional knowledge of more traditional media that could influence the way that you combine these new technologies to create experiences that really allow us to experience stories in ways that we hadn&#8217;t been able to before. Yeah, it really does feel like a serendipitous journey where I sort of stumbled into all of the places and things that I needed in order to be the person that I am today to do the things that I want to do. But I like to believe that that&#8217;s how life is supposed to work. You put one foot in front of the other, and then you end up where‚Ä¶</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>‚Ä¶you&#8217;re supposed to be stepping out on faith, right?</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>You mentioned your mom, you mentioned this girlfriend you had at the time who were some of the other people that really helped support you during this journey.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m going to name off some of the folks that really stood me up at The Mill that first time. My first mentor, Kay Gowda, was the senior producer for that Mill digital team. And when I say he stepped in as a big brother and really looked out for me both from and in the office process perspective, but also from outside life, like, what are you trying to do in this space? And here are some of the possibilities. He really set me up with a lot of the tools that I still use to this day to help navigate ambiguity and figure out what it is that I want. He just sort of built in these habits of constantly seeking new information on a daily basis. I used to start my day by combing through like a folder of ten to twelve websites and blogs that would post about new marketing and technology experiences and news, and then I sort of put that together into an email to send out once a week for the team. I was already a curious individual, but being able to focus that curiosity in a way that tied to whatever productive endeavor that I was trying to achieve at the time, I think was a really formative bit of knowledge. You also helped me just sort of find the calm in the storm of being a producer in a high paced environment with lots of conflicting objectives and demands, just really being able to settle in and say, like, I&#8217;m not going to solve everything, but if I can solve one thing, what is that? And let me do that first.</p>
<p>It really sort of grounded me and allowed me to gracefully navigate some of the more tumultuous projects and moments in my career. So, Kay Gowda is a huge influence. The executive producer of that team, Bridget Shields, really looked out for me both in sort of setting me up for success in some of the smaller pitch projects that came in the door during that year that I worked there the first time. I mean, I did my first pitch to Nike and landed the job under her guidance. And she trusted me to do this, having not seen any real evidence that I could. She just trusted me and gave me the support to make decisions and was always available to talk through any questions that I had. But more than that, she looked out for me. When we all got fired, I was on that team for about eight months before, similar to your Slack, your #goodbye Slack channel, we were all individually called downstairs into the conference room one after another, and every time somebody came back up.</p>
<p>They came back up silent, closed their laptop, grabbed their things and walked out of the room. Yeah. Eventually I understood what was happening, started saving some files, but yeah, we were all sort of let go unceremoniously without notice. On a Friday and the following Monday morning, Bridget had an email in my inbox of three different places that she had already called to let them know that I was available for work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>She told me exactly what salary to say that I was being paid, which was not the salary that I was being paid, but it was definitely going to be a healthy increase. She told me exactly what projects to reference and how to represent my impact and what title I need to speak to. Interactive producer or creative producer. And that&#8217;s sort of where that naming convention was first introduced. For me, those connections, those calls that she made really paved the way for every job I&#8217;ve had since then. I really appreciate the way that she looks out for her team because I got to admit that wasn&#8217;t even something that was super special for me. She does that for everyone she works with. So, I really appreciate those individuals.</p>
<p>I think more recently, I got to give credit to that second Mill crew, the second stint, particularly on our Executive Briefing Center experiential multiyear project. These folks really helped me sort of figure out that I was more than just a good producer, that I could be a good creative leader as well. Kinda. Akash is top of the list. She&#8217;s my partner now. I met her there at The Mill. Our creative collaboration really expanded the ways that I felt comfortable showing up in executive meetings and representing creative work, not, you know, the X&#8217;s and O&#8217;s of a schedule or a budget. Collaborators like Will Arnold, whose endless curiosity really inspired me to continue to explore the visual concepts that I wanted to introduce into some of the work that I was exploring at the time.</p>
<p>And he actually came through and provided a lot of the projection visuals in the music video that I ended up directing a couple of years ago. Eric Chang, who&#8217;s a creative strategist and writer, and his wild imagination and reserved intellect‚Ä¶just a really grounding force that helps me cut the noise out and really focus on what matters while also finding joy in really small things. Yeah, I mean, I could probably go on and on and on. There&#8217;s so many people who have made it possible for me to be where I am today, and if I keep going, I&#8217;m going to go forever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What advice would you give to somebody that they&#8217;re listening to this episode, they&#8217;re hearing your story and everything and they want to sort of, I don&#8217;t know, maybe just try to figure out where they are right now. Like, maybe this has been a tough year for them and they&#8217;re feeling a bit unmoored and trying to kind of find their way in this current space. What advice would you give them?</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>I think first I&#8217;d say slow down and listen. Look around, see, take note of where you are and how you feel. I think ultimately one of the things that has been most emphasized over the last couple of years for me has been that you&#8217;re always exactly where you&#8217;re supposed to be. Where you go next is entirely up to you. We can only actually live in the present, but when we are able to be our most present, we actually get to expand the idea of what present is in order to reshape the past and what it means for us and to be able to sort of look further into the future as to where we want to go and what our next step should be for us anyway. Because ultimately, the only person who can tell you what to do next and where to go is you. Because you&#8217;re the only one who knows what you want and why you want it. There&#8217;s plenty of noise in the world that can sort of interrupt, obscure or even manipulate that knowledge.</p>
<p>I mean, we&#8217;ve talked about it over the course of this conversation. The technology, the corporations, the capitalism, the politics, all of it. All of that noise makes it really hard to hear your own voice. But when you seek that voice through stillness, through rest, through reflection, it becomes a lot easier to know that your next step is the right one because it&#8217;s your step and that is really all that matters.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Where do you see yourself in the next five years? Like, what kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>Well, first I want to be on set of major Sci-Fi production, hopefully making my story come to life. Even if that is an optimistic projection. I want to be involved in the conversation around how these new forms of technology, particularly artificial intelligence, and virtual reality, don&#8217;t have to be at odds with the most precious aspects of our human experience, our genuine humanity. In fact, if we take the time to understand ourselves and the technologies in full context of how either came to be, then we can find parallels that can between those sort of evolutionary journeys and use the relationship between the human interface and the technological interface to better ourselves from a truly human perspective. I don&#8217;t mean, like, escaping into fantasy worlds and ignoring deteriorating physical reality that we all live in in this planet or even sort of like replacing aspects of our humanity with technology to make things easier or more convenient. I do mean truly improving the human experience, deepening our connection with each other and with the natural world through experiences that teach us about those relationships as we interact with these technologies that are so complex and so immersive. Those are the kinds of projects that I want to bring to life. From an experiential standpoint, five years from now, I want to be having the conversation of how these experiences that I&#8217;ve created for both installation and virtual reality have really tried to hammer home that point and bring that conversation to a larger audience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work? Where can they follow you, follow your journey? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>Well, you guys can follow me on Instagram for my musings and ramblings. That&#8217;s at U-A-T-J-O-N-C or keep up with me via my website. Jonrobinson.me. That&#8217;s J-O-N-R-O-B-I-N-S-O-N me. Honestly, those are the two best places to keep up with what I&#8217;m doing. And a lot of what I&#8217;m doing on Instagram is shouting about our current realities. So, brace yourself and bring your thinking cap. I love a discussion.</p>
<p>Always happy to hear from anybody on any of these topics. Don&#8217;t be a stranger, so to speak.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, Jon Robinson, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I mean, I sort of had an idea how I thought this conversation might go and then once you started talking, I feel like it just sort of went in a completely kind of free form direction, which I think is good. I mean, I think we touched on a lot of different topics that are, I think, on the minds of a lot of creatives right now. Particularly, I think, a lot of creatives that work in the tech industry and such. I really feel like you&#8217;re at a place where you&#8217;re trying to figure it out, you&#8217;re trying to figure out what your next move is. And I think you gave such great advice about just slowing down and listening and letting that be what guides you next. And I&#8217;m really excited to see what&#8217;s going to guide you next once you come sort of at the end of this personal journey. So thank you so much for coming on the show.</p>
<p>I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Robinson:</b></p>
<p>Thanks for having me, Maurice. I enjoyed this conversation. Yeah, I look forward to the new individuals you have on. This has been an amazing platform, and I really appreciated the opportunity.</p>

<p>Azeez Alli-Balogun came highly recommended by several former guests, so I knew that a great conversation was going to happen. Azeez currently works as a lead product designer on the globalization team at Netflix, and he&#8217;s also a co-founder of <a href="https://www.designtodivest.com/" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Design to Divest</a>. But if you think that&#8217;s all there is to Azeez&#8217;s story, then think again!</p>
<p>We started off with a quick 2022 check-in, and then he talked about his plan to work on more Black-focused design projects, and also gave a glimpse at what it&#8217;s like working at Netflix. From there, Azeez spoke about growing up in Louisiana, becoming a jewelry designer, and how he transitioned into product design. We also spent some time talking about Design to Divest and Azeez shared what he wants the organization to accomplish in the future. Everyone has the power to make change with design, and Azeez is a prime example of this!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
My name is Azeez Alli-Balogun. I am a product designer at Netflix, a product design lead at Netflix on the globalization team. What that really entails is that we&#8217;re looking at how do we enable Netflix products and the content that we create to live in local markets, but also experience global audiences.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I work a lot on the enterprise tools or the tools that help us create the subtitling assets, the dubbing assets, and all of those things that actually help our content become very, very locally resonant in local markets and local geographies, but also accessible to global audiences.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going really great. It&#8217;s interesting. We&#8217;re in the end of January, and it&#8217;s been incredibly productive, quite a lot of work that I&#8217;ve been doing in the beginning of the year. I&#8217;ve been invited to do a couple of different types of projects that I feel were very, very impactful. I think it&#8217;s just there&#8217;s so many seeds and so many things that have been planted in 2020 and 2021 that are starting to kind of blossom a little bit, which is both good and, also, I&#8217;m getting to a point where I need to make sure I&#8217;m prioritizing myself and my rest. I want to make sure that 2020 doesn&#8217;t lead to burnout for me with opportunities coming my way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything special in particular that you want to achieve this year?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I mean the biggest thing that I think is really focusing on some of the work that I&#8217;m doing with Design to Divest, but really starting to produce more content or areas in where people from marginalized backgrounds, particularly the Black communities and African communities and indigenous communities, to be able to access design differently, access learning differently, and be able to participate in the creation of the world that we live in through their own cultural knowledge base.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So that type of work is something that I&#8217;m looking to start to really tangibilize in more meaningful ways. So I&#8217;m pretty hopeful that with all of the work that I&#8217;m doing and the projects and the communities that I&#8217;m a part of, that I&#8217;ll be able to create these platforms that allow or bring in more Black, African, and indigenous creatives to the forefront of creating some of the institutions that are going to shape the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, let&#8217;s talk about the work that you&#8217;re doing at Netflix. You&#8217;re the product design lead for the globalization team there. Now, you mentioned what you&#8217;re doing has to do with subtitles and dubbing. I can only imagine probably after the success of titles like Squid Game and Lupin and stuff that you probably have had a lot on your plate. But tell me more about the work that you do.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s a lot of stakeholder management. So it&#8217;s interesting in the sense that the team that I&#8217;m working on really crosses so much of what Netflix does. It&#8217;s an integral part to growth. As Netflix grows our global subscriber base and grows into global markets, it&#8217;s incredibly important that we&#8217;re effective in the way that we localize our content as we start to even increase the volume of content that we produce, the volume of film and the volume of movies, and really trying to create platforms for different geographical spaces outside of Hollywood to be able to share their stories.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So a lot of the work is when you go into Netflix and you&#8217;re able to see the option to choose 20 different subtitles or watch things in dubbing, all of that stuff is work that I&#8217;m directly impacting and the team that I work on directly impacts. We&#8217;re working with linguists. We&#8217;re working with project managers. We&#8217;re working across the board with so many different types of stakeholders to ensure that there is quality attached to the subtitles and the dubbing and that if a director in Nigeria creates a television show or a movie, that same movie can be enjoyed by somebody in Swedish and it doesn&#8217;t lose a lot of the cultural nuances that represent how that content or how that TV show or film was created.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s a heavy task because it&#8217;s very difficult to even measure things, like what is a good subtitle? What is a good dubbing or voiceover? Can we make sure that we are staying true to the content? Because when you think about different languages, it&#8217;s very, very &#8230; If you&#8217;re lucky enough to be able to speak multiple languages, then you know that there are certain nuances and certain kind of things that just don&#8217;t translate.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
You want to be able to translate those cultural nuances so people start to really understand what it actually means to experience the culture that that film or that television show or those characters are actually situated in. So there&#8217;s a lot of really trying to figure out how do we communicate, also creating a lot of the workflows that allow our stakeholders, the project managers internally at Netflix with the linguists and the other vendors that we use in order to create all of these assets, how do we allow them to do this work very, very effectively and at the volume and scale of the amount of content that we produce on a yearly basis?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So talk to me more about the team. What does the makeup look like?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a typical product team. I mean you have your designers. I lead a particular area of the globalization design side. I have two other design partners who are also design leads in other areas. I work with a product manager, and I&#8217;m in constant contact with the globalization project managers and program managers as well as vendors and linguists in order to really understand what is necessary and how to create the best conditions for their workflows to be successful in delivering on the subtitling and dubbing and other localization assets.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So the core team is I&#8217;ll have my UI front end team and backend team designer and me, as a designer, project manager. We&#8217;re the core product team building out all of the tools. And then we&#8217;re in constant communication with the project managers, the vendor managers, the linguists who are actually authoring and creating a lot of the subtitling and localization assets in order to ensure that we&#8217;re providing the tools that are really supporting their workflows in a positive way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So Netflix has linguists that are doing the translating, I mean as they&#8217;re listening through to the content and making sure that those subtitles, like you said, are kind of accurate to the plot, culturally accurate, et cetera.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean there&#8217;s a whole process there of subtitle authoring. I can&#8217;t get too deep into lots of that stuff because I think it&#8217;s one of the things that does set Netflix apart from some of the other services that you might encounter, the level of detail that we go into trying to create good subtitles. There&#8217;s a lot of experimentation and things that we&#8217;re doing right now in order to enable that process to be better for our members.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I remember when Squid Game had come out and there had been some kind of talk about like, &#8220;Oh, well, if you&#8217;re watching Squid Game, don&#8217;t watch it with subtitles because the subtitles aren&#8217;t right,&#8221; or something like that. Or no, it wasn&#8217;t the subtitles. It was the dubbing, I think, one of those two things. But I mean I can imagine even with a show like that, there&#8217;s still going to be some sort of cultural differences or things like that that get lost in translation.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean that&#8217;s exactly right. I mean there&#8217;s always going to be some dissonance. We&#8217;re always testing things out to try to get it right. I think the one thing that&#8217;s really great about the culture at Netflix and how we go about designing and building product is we experiment in order to figure out how we can learn and improve and constantly improve. So if we don&#8217;t get something right the first time, it&#8217;s a learning experience for us. We take all of that feedback and use it to ensure that we&#8217;re doing better as we move forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does an average day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Average day? I try to segment a little bit of my days or my week. Some days I load up with meetings, so I&#8217;m meeting with engineers and my product manager partner and other stakeholders. And then other days, I create that space for me to kind of just work and I&#8217;m designing and creating different concepts that are related to the conversations that I&#8217;ve been having, so kind of going through the whole design process, but in very, very short cycles.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not spending three months or two weeks or just doing nothing but research, but do longer cycles of discovery research on a particular area that we&#8217;re trying to improve operational efficiency on and then take that, summarize that research into some opportunities, create some concepts behind that, and then start to socialize that with engineering and product in order to start to tweak and do more of &#8230; I try to do much more co-creation, co-designing with the stakeholders, the engineers, and product all together.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That way the decisions that are being made are made with the right amount of input from the different internal stakeholders that influence how the product actually tangibilizes itself. So my typical days typically would be I have some times where I&#8217;m dedicated. I need time to intake all the information that I&#8217;ve gotten and then start to visualize that into some sort of concept.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
And then a lot of the times, I am taking those concepts in meetings and doing a lot of co-design in order to fulfill requirements and understand what the needs are directly with both the users and then my product stakeholders as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the most challenging part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Stakeholder management maybe. The reason that I would say that is when I think about the idea of complexity, what really makes anything complex is that you have a bunch of different competing priorities that happen at scale. So being able to really clearly align all the different priorities that are happening from different parts of the process and different stakeholders into something that works, I think, is the most difficult part because I&#8217;m also constantly listening and observing what people are saying, what people are doing, and then trying to translate that down into a language that can be understood by everyone who is involved.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
As you know, it&#8217;s interesting as we talk about language and linguistics, not only in different languages. There are different languages within different industries. There are different languages within different professions. So everyone might have a different way of communicating the same thing. Oftentimes, you can be in meetings where people are trying to communicate an idea or a concept with the language of their own profession.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So engineers might be communicating things in a certain way that&#8217;s different from product. That&#8217;s also slightly different from the way that the type of language that design would use to communicate something. And then our end users are using a different type of language and trying to wrangle all of those different concepts and in the way that people are trying to express what it is that they&#8217;re trying to think of in a way that everyone&#8217;s aligned on and everyone kind of understands.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That&#8217;s where I feel like a lot of the true power of design comes because once you start to take the language and start to visualize things, then people can have something to have an opinion about. They can have something to kind of analyze and say, &#8220;That&#8217;s not it,&#8221; or, &#8220;That is it,&#8221; or, &#8220;It&#8217;s this and this. Add this or that or the other.&#8221; But bringing life to the words that are being said by all of the people in the room and then allowing people to kind of mold what&#8217;s been created to make sure that everyone&#8217;s voices is really being heard.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I would imagine language and linguistics probably influence a lot of the design work in general, right?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean just really trying to understand the nuances of it and how those nuances can be misinterpreted because, as you know, a misinterpretation of even body language or a language or just a word or a concept can have dire consequences. So it&#8217;s important operationally as well as it is tangibly when we&#8217;re trying to create the product and making sure that the things that we create are very, very clear and transparent.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Netflix, it&#8217;s been an interesting place working. It&#8217;s been the most different place that I&#8217;ve worked at in my career because of the culture. The culture at Netflix is very unique. As I mentioned a little bit before about the experimentation culture of just trying to do things to learn, to get feedback, and then course correct. That also kind of goes into how we&#8217;re managed as employees. There&#8217;s a lot of the idea of freedom and responsibility and then the culture of feedback. All of those feed into the way that we&#8217;re able to work and the way that we&#8217;re able to kind of explore different areas of our profession in ways that we may have been restricted in other organizations.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I think that that&#8217;s a huge part that I typically really enjoy at Netflix and enjoy working with a bunch of other people who have similar mindset of growth and discovery and learning. It really shows through whenever we&#8217;re able to create, learn from the products and the things that we create, and prove it for our members.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. That&#8217;s pretty cool. It sounds like Netflix does give you that freedom. I know there&#8217;s some companies of people whom I would love to interview, but they have a strict embargo on their employees cannot do podcasts or anything like that. So it&#8217;s good that at least they let you all be able to talk about your work and do other things freely.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean it&#8217;s definitely encouraged, but I mean there&#8217;s definitely tons of stuff that we can&#8217;t say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I walk a line a lot of times trying to make sure that &#8230; Because there&#8217;s so much transparency at Netflix and I think that that&#8217;s one of the really great parts of the culture at Netflix is that, as an employee there, the leadership from the top down is always going to be as transparent as possible. But with that comes responsibility of we&#8217;re letting you know all of this information. We don&#8217;t expect you to go out and tell the world all of the secrets and things. This is internal information that we are providing you context so you&#8217;re able to really do your job to the best of your ability. We don&#8217;t want to hide things from you.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
But it comes with a lot of responsibility, that level of transparency and that level of trust that our leaders kind of put in us as contributors to the mission that the company is trying to achieve.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Gotcha. I&#8217;m curious to learn more about you, your particular origin story. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Both of my parents are from Nigeria, and I was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. So I grew up in Louisiana. I spent most of my childhood in Louisiana and went there to high school. I went to Southern University when I graduated high school for a couple of semesters before switching over to design and going to University of Louisiana at Lafayette. But growing up, I wouldn&#8217;t have thought of myself as being a designer. I wasn&#8217;t exposed to it in that way. I mean my dad was in school for architecture, so I was exposed to that.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
But the ideas of industrial design or other aspects of design weren&#8217;t really things that came across. I played basketball, growing up. I was more interested in trying to go to the NBA than I was with anything else. But I was also an avid reader. I read quite a lot, and I did a lot of writing, drawing. So there was always that creative aspect, but I imagined myself going into medical school rather than design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So when you went to University of Louisiana at Lafayette though, you ended up majoring in industrial design. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean that was really the reason that I left Southern University because they didn&#8217;t have an industrial design program. So initially, whenever I was in school, my intention was to be a pediatric surgeon. Actually, I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to study biomedical engineering and then go to medical school to be a pediatric surgeon.&#8221; That was my intention. At the time, too, biomedical engineering was a fairly new field of study within the higher education to where if you really wanted to do that, you had to get a master&#8217;s degree.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So while I was at Southern University, I needed to kind of create a curriculum for myself, working with my engineering faculty. I was doing mechanical engineering and double majoring in cellular molecular biology. But after a while, I was just like, &#8220;Something about this is not really what I want to do. I would love to create the medical tools and the medical devices. I&#8217;d love to design those things.&#8221; But it was just something that just didn&#8217;t feel right in terms of the education for me while I was in engineering.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I started doing some research. Maybe I might like automotive design. Through that, I found what industrial design was, and I was like, &#8220;Whoa. With this field, I can actually design medical devices. I can actually go and design prosthetic legs and all of these different things that I was interested in kind of creating.&#8221; That&#8217;s how I found University of Louisiana at Lafayette because that was the only school in Louisiana, at the time, that had an industrial design program. So I ended up going there and studying industrial design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So you kind of, I guess, looked at another way to get into the medical field then by looking at industrial design.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So in your early post-grad career after you left school, you ended up going into jewelry design. I&#8217;m curious. What drew you to that?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It wasn&#8217;t anything that really drew me. It was literally I graduated shortly after a recession in Louisiana. There were no jobs, really. It was really difficult to get a design job, especially in the South, in Louisiana. So really, what happened was that my portfolio was a bunch of &#8230; It was pediatric medical tools and prosthetics and stuff like that. The jewelry company, which had a connection to some of our professors at University of Louisiana, looked at my work and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;We really like your aesthetic visually. You have a really good sense of style and taste,&#8221; even looking at the medical tools, the medical stuff that I designed.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That&#8217;s literally how I jumped into jewelry design. I was interested in fashion. I was interested in design in general, but I wasn&#8217;t intending to go be a jewelry designer. If anything, I would have wanted to go to do something in footwear design at Nike because that would have merged a lot of the biomechanics and technical medical things that I was thinking about in terms of design with human performance. So yeah. Jewelry design just kind of came about. It was an opportunity that kind of came about, but it really allowed me to start to understand what it meant to design for things that were going to be worn on people&#8217;s bodies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That makes sense. How long were you a jewelry designer?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I was there for about two to two and a half years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It was quite an interesting experience, but even though while I was there &#8230; This is also the field of user experience design or a lot of the digital product design, all of that stuff. That was still fairly in its infancy. So even while I was there, I participated in some things, some interface things that were very interesting. From there, after I left that company, I wanted to discover what is it that I really wanted to do, but I also needed to look at where the market was going.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Industrial design jobs weren&#8217;t en masse. A lot of these jobs that when you&#8217;re designing physical things, they don&#8217;t have incredibly large teams. Just seeing the digital world kind of pick up, I started to make some pivots over into really learning that particular skillset, branched off to try to do a little bit of my own freelance work, both as an industrial designer. But then what I found was that I was getting more clients, more people looking for branding and web development and more digital kind of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That&#8217;s kind of how I ended up pivoting or going to grad school to learn really more of a service design kind of method to incorporate both to be more agnostic about what my skillsets delivered and more focused on what the outcome needed to be of whatever it is that a client or somebody wanted to create.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good way to put it in terms of trying to be more agnostic because what I&#8217;m hearing, and you can please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong here, it sounds like you were just trying to find where you were going to fit in. You&#8217;ve graduated. You have these design skills. While there certainly were things that you wanted to do in terms of design, those opportunities just weren&#8217;t available. So you were trying to see what could maybe your skills transfer into.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean I think that that&#8217;s a good characterization. I&#8217;m a person who is always ready to adapt to a situation. I have my core values and principles that I&#8217;m going to stay in those, and I&#8217;m not going to allow my value set and my principles to be swayed. But those principles aren&#8217;t rigid outcomes. They just help guide me in terms of the decisions that I need to make in life. But at the same time, I don&#8217;t create a level of rigidity to what it is that I can be and what it is that I can do.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Because it in the same way of when you&#8217;re designing a product or a service for someone or for people or a community, you need to allow it to be what it needs to be rather than always trying to force it into being something that you envisioned from the beginning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when did you decide to go to grad school? Was that during this time as well?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. That was during this time. I was looking at a handful of schools. I was looking at Pratt, RISD. I almost went to SCAD for the service design program because I had a friend who I was in undergrad with who was there, and he told me it was a great program. Service design&#8217;s still kind of a fairly newer field in design in the United States. It&#8217;s still catching on. You&#8217;re starting to see it more so now than it was years ago. I mean it&#8217;s definitely been something that&#8217;s far more developed in Europe than it has been in the United States. That&#8217;s just a reflection of the market and how we view the utility of design here at organizations.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Hearing the service design methods and methodologies, that was very interesting to me, and I was ready to go to SCAD. But also, another friend of mine who I was in undergrad with had mentioned ArtCenter to me before, and I really liked the rigor that ArtCenter placed on developing your technical skills and the level of polish that a lot of the portfolios and a lot of the students had the capacity for after graduating from ArtCenter. And then also, ArtCenter had this program with the Drucker School of Management where the graduate industrial design program also could be a dual MBA degree.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Once I got there, I didn&#8217;t see the usefulness not necessarily in an MBA because I did take MBA classes at UCLA. I do see a benefit in that, but I didn&#8217;t see the benefit for that particular school that ArtCenter was partnering with. So I didn&#8217;t actually go forward with that, though it was a decision that I made to go to ArtCenter in the first place because that option was available.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
While you were there, you also managed to work on an internship which let you transition into product design, right?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I did a couple of internships there. The education, too, in grad ID, the name can be misleading because it&#8217;s industrial design. But really a lot of the training was for us to be innovation leaders, to be able to come in and really understand what the business needs are for a company and help them pivot into creating products and services that now are able to accommodate the changing landscape. So we would routinely have different companies come in. This is part of the ArtCenter education where different companies come in and do these studio projects.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
We did one with Uber whenever I was in maybe my fourth semester or something like that, where Uber was creating their Uber Air platform. We worked in groups with other students from other departments. So we had transportation designers, automotive designers, as well as interaction designers, in addition to us in graduate industrial design and worked with some of the key executives for that particular unit doing the Uber Air. Our task was really to design what that whole experience would be if we were to create air taxis.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
If Uber were to go into this business, how do we start to visualize what that whole experience would be, all the way from understanding what the airport security type situation would be to what is the interior of the electric vertical landing takeoff vehicle going to be, all the way to really understanding the market. So if you create this type of service, well, who are going to be the people to use this service and who are going to be the early adopters all the way down to the late adopters in order to get this service off of the ground?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So it was a pretty involved project that took a whole semester where we built life-sized mock-ups to test out what the interior of the vehicle could be and could look like. We did a lot of architectural design and sketches to understand where would we create and put some of these what we call sky ports, which would be the airports for people to access these vehicles, designing also how would we implement or integrate this into the existing application, so if somebody wanted to catch an Uber Air vehicle. So it was a pretty involved project that spanned the scope of a bunch of different design skills from automotive design to interaction design to industrial design and whatnot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Kind of sounds like a air taxi, in a way.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Exactly. It was an air taxi. There&#8217;s so many different nuances in terms of what that whole experience could or would be. And also, there are limitations to the technology that existed at the time, still even to right now. A lot of that technology is still being developed in a way that could make it really feasible and economical to launch a service like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I would imagine also even just getting FAA certification because, unlike something like UberX where anyone that has a driver&#8217;s license can drive, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean anyone with a pilot&#8217;s license, I would imagine, would do Uber Air or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s definitely some technical and some licensing, piloting things there, especially, also, I mean you&#8217;re thinking about just air traffic control as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, that&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I mean that&#8217;s been there for a while. There&#8217;d be some adjustments and things that would need to be made in order to allow for another set of vehicles to be in the air.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after you graduated from ArtCenter College of Design for grad school, you ended up working at a couple of other places before Netflix. You worked at a biotech company called Script Health. So you, I guess, in a way managed to get around to doing some work in the medical field, even in this sort of roundabout way. But then you also worked at IBM working on products on their data, AI, and cloud integration teams. When you look back at those two experiences specifically, what do you remember the most?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
It was interesting because with Script Health, one of my friends who&#8217;s a pharmacist, that was his startup that he was creating. I was actually working on that while I was in grad school and helping him really design and bring to life the vision of that product and that service that he was trying to create. So I won&#8217;t go too deep into it, but the gist of that really was building out a service to deal with the opioid epidemic and providing the right type of medication for overdoses, things like naloxone, to places in rural communities.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a huge lack of access to the right types of drugs and services in the most marginalized communities or the most affected communities. And then that learning, kind of taking a product from zero to one, the amount of work and effort that it takes to do the research and then finding a market fit, pivots and things that need to happen, partnerships that need to be made and created, and then visualizing the concept and telling the story and the narrative in a way that is going to inspire and communicate what it is about.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That was also a crash course for me, really working with engineers as well as working with outside agencies that were taking my design work and starting to code it into something and really understanding what are the specific things that I need to communicate in order to make sure that what I do design ends up being the thing that gets created and it not being some kind of mangled version of that because there are details that I left out or things that I didn&#8217;t communicate that they just had to make a decision on, and it may not be the right decision.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
When it comes to IBM, the thing that I learned at IBM really was a lot of stakeholder management and also a lot of leadership skills, what it means to manage up, as well as how to align people and influence people around a shared objective and a shared goal and then trying to get things done within a short period of time. I feel like those were some of the key things. I mean I can dive really deep into aspects of that, but I think those were the main things that I&#8217;ve learned.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Working with people, I think, is an incredibly important part of being a designer, and understanding how to do that effectively, I think, is something that it takes a lot of designers a lot of time to really understand what it actually means to do that beyond just your hard technical skills.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, another thing that you sort of created that came about while you were at ArtCenter was Critical Discourse in Design. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. That happened while I was at IBM. So this was after my graduate program. I still have a lot of really great connections with a lot of the faculty at ArtCenter. After the murder of George Floyd, there was just a lot of energy around something needs to be done. I&#8217;m in the design community. Think about racism. When we think about prejudice, when we think about all of the things, these institutions that are perpetuating these things, they are designed institutions. They&#8217;re created.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
For me, in addition to, okay, well, protesting is one thing. But based off of my own skillsets and my own proximity to the type of work and things that I do, how can I start to impact or influence the change that I want to see in the world? So I started these conversations with some of my friends who are still faculty at ArtCenter to try to uncover what is something that we can do. We didn&#8217;t really have an idea of what it was going to be.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
But through the conversations and through a lot of the things that I was talking about in terms of how &#8230; A quote that I constantly say is that, &#8220;Design is the invisible hand that shapes all lived experience.&#8221; So Critical Discourse in Design came about when we started really thinking about when you think about oppression, oppression needs physical tools and objects. It needs a physical space. It needs to be designed.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So when you think about you can go throughout history and you can look at what are the tools or the innovations of oppression? A noose, a prison cell, all of these different things. So if you can design for oppression, then you can design for liberation. Critical Discourse in Design came about like, &#8220;Well, what does that conversation of designing for liberation, what does that actually mean? How do we start to translate theory into action? And then who are the voices that we need to bring to the table in order to be able to have these conversations?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Because when you think about the design industry, also where the Black designers is calling out is the 3% or 4%, depending on who you ask, of the people who are designers are Black. So the voices that are the most impacted by the things that are being created in the world are not at the table to voice how they feel things should be. They&#8217;re not able to provide their cultural intelligence to the institutions and the systems and the tools and the things that get created in the world.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So Critical Discourse in Design really was a response to that. It was really a response to how do we start to now bring in these voices and also to leave people not with just new words and new theories, but a theory that can turn into practice and really starting to understand what the connection between pedagogy, what people are learning, is with practice, how people create, how people experience and actually deliver things into the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, let&#8217;s talk about Design to Divest, which it sounds like came out of Critical Discourse in Design. Tell me about that. I know you&#8217;re one of the founding members of this collective. We&#8217;ve also had another member of the collective on the show before, Michael Collett. But yeah. Talk to me about Design to Divest.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. While I was actually creating Critical Discourse in Design, one of my really close friends who was working with part of Design to Divest messaged me and said, &#8220;Hey, do you have some capacity to join the steering committee here? This is what we&#8217;re doing.&#8221; So I joined Design to Divest. At the time, it was really meant to mobilize design skills and different designers, to mobilize those design skills around social impact projects. It was very like graphic design-based.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I think part of what I was doing whenever I joined the team was really thinking about what Design to Divest actually meant as a concept, and what are the most impactful ways that we can create positive change or the change that we want to see in the world? That started over the past two years that we&#8217;ve been just having these discussions and doing projects and working on things to manifest into a version of what it is today, where we have a lot of things that we&#8217;re going to be releasing this year, hopefully, and that really talks about what it means to divest the inequitable systems that have been designed and created in the world. How do we start to celebrate and design for the communities on the margins?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean I think that came about at such a monumental time, during the summer that you mentioned where, of course, there were people out in the streets that were protesting against police brutality. You talked about the murder of George Floyd. Again, it seems like this was a time when a lot of people were really looking for this kind of thing. They were looking to hear from Black voices, but also just looking for ways that they can, I guess, channel whatever frustrations they had into something more positive.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. Not to say that that time still isn&#8217;t happening now, but [crosstalk 00:45:33]-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah. We&#8217;re still in it very much. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
We&#8217;re very much in it, but it was reaching fever pitches. It wasn&#8217;t just in the United States, it was globally. Me being Nigerian and seeing with SARS and the protests that were happening in Nigeria, the protests that were happening in South America, things happening in Brazil, it was everywhere, where you started to see people were really fed up with the institutions and the things that were meant to serve them. But people were just like, &#8220;Nothing is actually serving any of us, and nothing is serving us in a way that&#8217;s going to provide any level of comfort or any level of support. It&#8217;s actually doing the opposite.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I think Design to Divest became, especially for designers, because I think so many designers get into design feeling that they can change something or that there&#8217;s some sense of positivity that they can use design to affect, but no one ever tells them how. And then it typically falls flat with very altruistic ideas that really don&#8217;t connect back to impact. It just connects back to some sense of moral I don&#8217;t want to say superiority, but just a sense of moral reflection that you did a project that did something, but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily connect back to impact.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I think with the idea of Design to Divest, we really want to give people a path to connect the things that they do to the impact that they want to see in the world, the impact that they want to see in institutions, and the impact that they want to see in the different products and tools and experiences that we experience in the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, speaking of that impact, given now that the collective has gone on now, what? I guess this will be your second year of going into things?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you want to see Design to Divest accomplish?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Quite a lot over time. But I think about education is a really core thing in terms of &#8230; One of the things that we&#8217;ve identified, too, is that there&#8217;s so many designers on the margins, designers of color, but particularly Black and indigenous designers who don&#8217;t have access to any type of content or education that teaches design in a way that validates their culture, in a way that validates their identity, in a way that celebrates the cultural intelligence of their heritage towards the creation of the things that exist in the world.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
When you look at design, the canon of literature and text that&#8217;s being taught to designers all are from European white men, and so there&#8217;s always a cultural disconnect. Essentially, what it does is informs people getting into design that you need to either erase your culture and assimilate into this culture if you want to find success in this profession because your culture is devalued or isn&#8217;t valued as a producer of good design, if you call something good design.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So part of what my hopes for Design to Divest is to really provide that platform, on one hand, for Black and indigenous designers to be able to have content and community to engage with around design that validates their identity, that validates their cultural heritage, and then that brings them to the table of creation. I feel like the world is a group project and, typically, only a select group of communities and culture have gotten to participate in creating the institutions, organizations, and business that shape the lived experiences for all of us.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s time that we create this space of ownership. I think this is what equity means, ownership and creation, and stop blocking these communities that are on the margins, Black, indigenous communities from participating in the creation and the stewardship of the world. I think that I want Design to Divest to be that platform that allows Black and indigenous communities to harness their ability to design through their own cultural intelligence, to create and populate the institutions and things in the world that are going to serve our communities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the people that inspire you?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a tough question because I&#8217;m typically just inspired by people, in general. I&#8217;m inspired by culture, in general. Obviously, I&#8217;m inspired by my family, by my parents, aunts, and uncles, especially coming from Nigeria, making a way for themselves as expats into the United States and balancing multiple cultures. I&#8217;m also inspired by other designers, other creators, but also other people in other professions. I constantly draw inspiration from economists, from lawyers, from doctors in the way that they approach the work that they do.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I can say, as of late, too, I&#8217;ve been inspired by people like Andr√© Leon Talley and Virgil, who both passed, but seeing the impact that they&#8217;ve had. You can see that by the outpouring of support and the outpouring of responses that people have to their passing. To have that level of impact on community, I think, is also something that&#8217;s incredibly inspiring to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to somebody that is looking to enter into the design field? Because it sounds like, with your career, you&#8217;ve managed to really take that and apply it across a number of different facets of design and, even now, you&#8217;re still kind of paying that forward with the work you&#8217;re doing in Netflix, but also with this community work through Design to Divest. So if someone&#8217;s listening to this and this is inspiring them to want to get into design in some sort of way, what would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I mean one of the most important things, as a designer, is to be curious. I think that one thing that I would tell people is you just kind of have to do it. There&#8217;s so many people who are going to have something to say about whatever it is that you do. It&#8217;s also kind of that&#8217;s the idea of design is that whenever you design, there&#8217;s a difference between art and design in a sense, whereas design is really not meant for yourself. Design is outward. It&#8217;s meant to be critiqued by the people that you&#8217;ve created it for. So you can&#8217;t wait for perfection.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I think I would tell people that they have to just go out and do it. But another one of the most important things, too, is that design is a very community-driven profession. I think that it&#8217;s not done in isolation. I think that that&#8217;s in contrast to the way that we were taught about design. We were always taught about these individual people who are design heroes, whether it&#8217;s Dieter Rams or Frank Gehry or whatever. They&#8217;re not doing these things alone as individual people. They have a network of people. They&#8217;re talking to people.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
They are influenced by people, and they are finding different people who is inspiring to them to communicate with and also build with. So one of the most important things is to constantly seek out the people who are doing things that you find interesting and try to have a conversation with them and try to build your own communities, because that&#8217;s going to be the path forward for you finding the opportunities to design the things that you want to design, to create the things that you want to create and with the people that you want to create.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
And then lastly, too, I would also say is that you really want to start from a place of purpose. So if you don&#8217;t really have a purpose yet or you haven&#8217;t identified what that is, definitely just take some time to think about it. As everything, it could be an iteration. Your purpose whenever you were 16 could be different when you&#8217;re 24 or 50. But having a sense of purpose and principles to back that purpose then allow you to make decisions a lot easier. It gives you something to filter the opportunities that come your way with something that means something more to you than just existing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work would you like to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
I&#8217;m doing a lot of the work that I want to be doing in combination with Design to Divest and some of the freelance projects that I&#8217;ve been working on as well. But I think more of that work, more of the work that I&#8217;m doing with Design to Divest, more of the creating the platforms, creating archives and things who are Black and indigenous designers to be able to participate in the creation of the world. Also, I mean I do quite a lot of mentorship.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So I&#8217;d love to be able to build careers and create more pathways for designers from other marginalized communities, including Black communities and other marginalized communities to have a pathway to create. So I see within the next five years, continuing to grow and scale the impact that I&#8217;m able to have on the design community from both a pedagogical, educational standpoint as well as a practice and people standpoint.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So when I think about the practice, it&#8217;s really illustrating to both the business and design world that you want to be able to take &#8230; What it really means to be diverse and to harness diversity for innovation is being able to take the different cultural knowledge systems that exist, where there&#8217;s the aboriginal system of knowledge, the African system of knowledge, and being able to apply that to the problems that you&#8217;re facing as a society or in your particular company, reframing the problem underneath those systems of knowledge, and then allowing those systems of knowledge to be able to deliver on solutions for you.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
So doing work that allows me to bring more of those different systems of knowledge and those different diverse perspectives into the creation of things, and then on the people side of just continuing to bring more of those people who are holders of that knowledge, the descendants of African people from different African cultures who hold that knowledge or indigenous people, Native people, and providing a platform for them to use that knowledge that&#8217;s been passed down to them to design and create things that make the world a better place.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and your work and all your projects and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. I try to not be so visible online all the time. They can find me on my Instagram, Azeez_Alli. In the near future, we&#8217;ll be releasing a new website for Design to Divest where they can check out some of that work that I&#8217;m doing. If anyone wants to chat with me or anything like that, they can always shoot me a message on LinkedIn. I definitely try to respond to people who reach out to me and might not be immediate, but definitely something that I&#8217;m open to chatting more and more with people who resonate with some of the things that I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Azeez Alli, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show, one, of course, for telling your story about how you got into design. But I think it&#8217;s really important, especially now, as a lot of people are really looking at the work they do and try to figure out how it can make an impact in the world, I think the way that you&#8217;re taking your design knowledge and, one, how you&#8217;ve been able to apply it to different parts of design, but then, two, also using it in a way to pay it forward to the community is something that is super important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hope that we get to see a lot more of that in the future. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Azeez Alli-Balogun:</b><br>
Yeah. Thank you so much for having me.</p>

<p>You may not have heard much about Eric Bailey, but there&#8217;s a pretty good chance that you&#8217;ve encountered his work out in the world. As the VP of experience design at Zillow, he brings over 20 years of strategic thinking, imagining, and making to revolutionize the process of buying or selling your home.</p>
<p>Our conversation began with Eric discussing how he builds culture and maintains joy on his team, and he spoke broadly about what he calls &#8220;the limitless possibilities of UX design.&#8221; He also talked about growing up in Ohio, being around for the early days of the Organization of Black Designers and Project Osmosis (which he co-founded), building his brand Properganda, and he gave the secret for how he&#8217;s maintained his authenticity throughout this career. According to Eric, anyone can look within and fulfill their potential through design &#8212; and he&#8217;s absolutely right!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Well, my name&#8217;s Eric Bailey, and I&#8217;m a design lead. I lead a team of designers at a company called Zillow, and I&#8217;m also a graphic artist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going really well, not without its surprises. I think the big lesson in the last year and a half has been just be flexible, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
And be open to change. And so I would say that&#8217;s the one thing I&#8217;ve really learned is just be ready to expect the unexpected given the pandemic and given just changes in life that we can&#8217;t control. So be flexible and be ready also to take advantage of opportunities as they come up. But in general, me and my family, we&#8217;ve stayed healthy so we&#8217;re really, thankful for that. And yeah, and just really working through the different ways now that we interact with friends and family and also the way we work has changed shape for us. And so, yeah, I would say lots of silver linings for us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, I got to spend lots of time with family, really meaningful, deep time, things that we would probably never be able to do or have in any normal circumstances, so I have no complaints.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, this past year and a half, I mean, I guess really coming up on two years now that I think about it, it has been transformative in many ways. I feel like that&#8217;s the most apolitical way that I can state that. It has been very transformative. It has changed all of us in many different ways that I think we will still be unpacking hopefully years after this time has passed. There has definitely been a general shift in the collective consciousness that I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to just snap back from.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, it&#8217;s a great way to describe it, is just transformation in every aspect of life. And so, yeah, it makes you realize that you have to become, I guess, a being of transformation, right? You have to be able to change yourself too so that you can adapt. So, yeah, adaptation has been, I think, that keyword for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s the only thing constant in the world, change.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s what it is. Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about the work that you&#8217;re doing at Zillow where you are a VP of UX. How are things been going during the pandemic with the team?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, no, they&#8217;ve gone well. The pandemic created a big threat to human beings and our way of life, but also to business. And so, there were some real questions about how Zillow as a company or the real estate industry, in general, was going to fare. I think that because the company, Zillow that is, is really part of the technology frontier around real estate, automating processes, consolidating processes, Zillow actually did relatively or very well during the time. There was lots of activity, lots of engagement with the business, one, because now people are doing so much online, and then, two, because they&#8217;re starting to think about how the pandemic might shape where they live and how they live. And so, that was a boom to the business.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I would say to the design team and I think the workforce, we really took seriously the taking on remote work as the de facto way we approach our day-to-day. And that was a big shift. That was something that was, I think, we entered with real interest and did deep research with the workforce to get a sense of where their sensibilities were. The overwhelming majority felt like remote or having at least the option to work remotely was preferred. And so, we&#8217;ve done everything we can to really put in place processes and tools and even aspects of our culture structured around remote work and asynchronous work. And so it&#8217;s really interesting. I think, great, lots of benefits, obviously, right? Now we can work with folks from many markets, many regions. We have really now diverse teams when it comes to that. Obviously, people don&#8217;t have to commute as much. So lots of benefits there. But there were some trade-offs too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What sort of trade-offs?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been at Zillow for about three years, and I was a part of the team that was localized into an office, and now I&#8217;m part of a team that is distributed and virtual. And so, having experienced both, I would say one huge benefit of being in a physical space with folks is really the kinds of bonds you can build. I think that, eventually, we will need to, even with a remote workforce, we will need to create time together. We&#8217;ll be making plans for team offsites or onsites, I guess, and team meetings and really strategic moments for us to get together and collaborate. And that will be around problem-solving, but also mostly it&#8217;ll be around just building relationship and community with our team. So being in the same place just really does allow people to really get to know each other, I think, in a way that it&#8217;s difficult to do online.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How many people are on your team?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I have about 22 people on my team. I lead what we call an experience area. And that experience area is called buy, sell, and transact. We&#8217;re focused on creating end-to-end experiences that support someone&#8217;s ability to buy a home from Zillow, Zillow sells homes, to sell their home to Zillow, and the transactions necessary to make that happen. So all the way through closing. And so I lead a team of product designers, essentially, that focus on that. And then I partner with research, user experience research, and content strategy. We partner to create those experiences.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. It&#8217;s interesting. I guess, over the past maybe year or so, I&#8217;ve talked to other design leads, and it&#8217;s really interesting to see how content strategy has&#8230; or really content in general, written word has become more of the design process to the point where they&#8217;re considered designers or they sit on a design team in that way.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right. Yeah. Well, hence the word strategy in there, right? So not just writers, but these are folks that are creating strategies for basically touching and building bridges with customers, particularly when we are creating experiences that are either unprecedented or our customer base is unaware of, right? Most people know Zillow because of your ability to dream and shop, you come and look at homes, and you look at your neighbor&#8217;s home and how much they pay for it and things like that. But then there are all these other services. Well, you can actually sell us your home, or you can actually buy a home from us. These are things that less of our customers are aware of. And so, to really reach out to them and connect with them, we really need to be strategic about the way we communicate. And that&#8217;s more and more of an imperative for our business.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have there been any particular insights aside from just, I think, team makeup and asynchronous work and stuff? Are there any particular insights that have arose over the past year now that the team is distributed?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, one, remote work for some companies is old hat, but for Zillow, a company that&#8217;s, I think, we&#8217;re 6,000-plus, a large company like ours, I think we&#8217;re still navigating how you build culture, how you sustain culture. I think the company has a really strong and rich set of cultural values, and it&#8217;s very good at holding one another accountable and living up to those values. But then there&#8217;s sort of the unspoken things. In a virtual world, I think maintaining the joy of your experiences is something that requires a real attention and real intention. And so, our design team has spent a lot of time, especially our design leaders have spent a lot of time really trying to be creative about, &#8220;Well, how do we keep our team engaged? How do we have fun at what we do in lieu of having a space where you can improvise, right?&#8221; And so, we&#8217;ve really been experimenting and there&#8217;s still lots of work to do there. But sometimes it&#8217;s important just for us to get together and have fun.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
The amount of effort and energy that actually goes into architecting those is pretty large. That&#8217;s, I think, a big insight for us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I didn&#8217;t know Zillow was that big. 6,000 people?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, don&#8217;t quote me on the exact numbers. But yeah, we&#8217;re-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In the thousands.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. And that&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve grown from this online platform to now a broad range of services and products. We&#8217;re a lender, so we offer mortgages. We have rental experiences and services for landlords and for renters. So just a really now a broad range of experiences around the home. And so in that, lots of different service providers under one umbrella.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know a lot of people have been moving or downsizing or just changing up how they&#8217;re living because of the past year and a half or so with the pandemic. It&#8217;s interesting. How has Zillow helped to facilitate that outside of, I guess, what it&#8217;s for, which is real estate buying, selling, and searching? I don&#8217;t know, I guess I&#8217;m wondering, are there any particular ways that Zillow has helped out during this time in that process?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
For its employees or for just in the world?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
For the world, yeah. For the world.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s a great question. Well, there&#8217;s definitely this migration, right? The economists talk about this migration from urban centers and across state lines. Many folks now are not bound to a specific region to make a living, there&#8217;s an influx of movement of folks that are moving to other states. Some are moving back to the states they came from, right? They would&#8217;ve been centralizing in Silicon Valley and in Seattle, but now maybe they&#8217;re going back to the Midwest or maybe they&#8217;re going back South. So huge migration there that is, obviously, an opportunity for Zillow.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
But also there&#8217;s this multi-generational trend, right? We have now families that are thinking about, &#8220;Well, I should probably live closer to home or maybe even with my parents or even grandparents.&#8221; So there&#8217;s also an influx of folks coming together and actually buying homes or bringing families under one roof. So really interesting market trends. We have internal folks that look at this, but those have been some of the big macro trends that I think are really interesting. And then obviously just doing everything remote, the fact that you can now actually sell your home online, you can purchase a home completely online or almost. There are a number of companies also they&#8217;re springing up around this capability. But yeah, the future of buying a home and finding a home is going to change dramatically over the next five to 10 years.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
It could be very similar to something like trading in your car, right? You drive into the dealership with one car, you leave with a loan and a new car, and you&#8217;ve left your old car. It&#8217;s all just one stop where you were doing that, you&#8217;re solving that problem for yourself and you&#8217;re focused on that thing that you want to buy. That should be the experience of buying a home, and eventually, it will.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. What does a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Typical day&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Does that exist?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
No. Well, yeah, right, no day is typical. It&#8217;s interesting. I think for me and my team, there are a few things. One, we work really hard to try to package our meeting times to a very specific timeframe. So between the hours of 10:00 and 14:00 are when we try to make sure that our hours&#8230; this is when we have core meetings. One, it&#8217;s to accommodate for multiple time zones. But it&#8217;s also to make sure that the other times outside of that are considered flexible and should be focused on getting the work done. And so, that&#8217;s a practice that we are all trying to employ and adhere to, or live up to.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
On a day to day, there&#8217;s probably logging in in the morning, attending some meetings. There would either be team meetings. There might be critiques for the design team. They&#8217;re usually planning meetings, some meetings that are about the work that we&#8217;re going to do in the future. And then there&#8217;s usually heads down working time. And yeah, I think some of the meetings if you&#8217;re getting together with a team you might be working on a project, you might be in a sprint, so you&#8217;re working at some point in the sprint process like you&#8217;re ideating or maybe brainstorming. And so, we&#8217;ll be doing some sort of remote activities, collaborative exercises to arrive at some outcomes there with teams. There&#8217;d be multifunctional teams, so product managers, designers, engineers, even folks from marketing, and obviously content and research. But yeah, now it&#8217;s mostly online, whether it&#8217;s collaborative or heads downtime. I think that&#8217;s how I&#8217;d sum it up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You mentioned earlier about the challenge with building culture and maintaining joy. How have you been able to do that with your team specifically?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I think I have two teams. I see myself as a part of a group of peers. I partner with other product managers and engineers and folks that are cross-functional. And so, I do what I can to create somewhat of a culture there. And then I have my working team, my team of designers and design managers. But in terms of design and design managers, some important things are maintaining my one-on-one. So I have weekly one-on-ones with all my direct reports. I have two team&#8230; They&#8217;re not critiques, they&#8217;re really focused on having the team share their work at earlier stages to get coaching. So it&#8217;s less about giving direction and telling someone to make it blue instead of agreeing and more focused on changing the arc of their thinking. So pressure testing their strategy and the questions they&#8217;re asking and the answers they&#8217;re coming up with. So those, I would say, are two review meetings where leaders are giving feedback to the design team.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
And then there are monthly meetings. We have a team monthly meeting. We&#8217;ve opened that up as open format to make it&#8230; We let folks from the team lead it. And so, there&#8217;ll be someone who&#8217;ll volunteer and sometimes they&#8217;re workshops. Sometimes they&#8217;re about learning. Sometimes they&#8217;re about problem-solving. Sometimes they&#8217;re about bonding or connecting, but there could be a range of things. But really the meeting is the operating system or the lever you have to create culture.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I mentioned that other team and the other team is those cross-functional peers. And a lot of what I try to do there is really break the frame of your standard meeting format. When I&#8217;m leading meetings, I&#8217;m trying to make them interactive and make them conversations. I want them to be generative, so a lot of times I&#8217;m asking people to use the right side of their brains, folks that aren&#8217;t necessarily used to doing that. So giving them really solid provocations and asking them to think big with real big boat-like, &#8220;How might we,&#8221; statements?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
And then also done even some silly things like role play. I played Lori Greiner who&#8217;s one of the sharks from Shark Tank. We asked cross-functional teams to create concepts, and then I played a shark and evaluated the concepts, and they had to pitch those ideas to me. So even just trying to bring some humor into an otherwise what can be a, I would say, less than exciting format to computer screen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you wear a long blonde wig too?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I actually had a cut-out of her face. [inaudible 00:20:49]. And then actually before they came, I got them excited about it. I told them that we were going to have a guest actually, that Lori was coming. And so I&#8217;m a VP, so everyone thought, &#8220;Wait, maybe he knows her, maybe she&#8217;s coming.&#8221; They really got their pitches together for that, and of course, yeah, they got a big laugh when I came on with the mask.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. No, that&#8217;s good. I mean, that&#8217;s one of those ways that you bring joy is to just shake it up a little bit, you know?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, and not take yourself so seriously. We can&#8217;t do that, right? We have to have fun and remember that we&#8217;re human beings.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think more so than, I mean, just being human beings, we&#8217;re all human beings that are now going through this shared kind of traumatic experience. And so, I think anytime that when you&#8217;re at work, when you can let that facade down of it being so serious and just open up and be human, I think that&#8217;s what everyone just appreciates that now more than ever, I think.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right. Yeah, be authentic, your authentic self.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when you initially booked the interview, and people that have listened to the show noticed this, that I always ask this question about what do you want people to take away from the interview? And one of the things that you had mentioned early on was that UX is a field with limitless possibilities. Of course, you&#8217;re AVP of UX at Zillow. Can you expand on that for me? How, from your perspective, is UX a field of limitless possibilities?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
For those that know me, they know I&#8217;m really into self-actualization. I really come to the realization that my purpose is to create user experiences that help people become who they hope to be. And those would be experiences that end customers or users would use, and obvious industries are healthcare, education. In this case, it&#8217;s finding a home, right, finding a home is both existential for people, but it&#8217;s also aspirational. You can change the arc of someone&#8217;s life in finding a home. And then it&#8217;s also through my teams, right, creating experiences for them that help them become the vision of who they see in the future. I develop over the years, and I can talk a little bit more about that later. So I think humans have a limitless possibility, and I think that the design field is really the perfect platform for that. It&#8217;s a perfect sort of Petri dish at least for creative people to discover who you are, who you want to be.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s because of a few things. I think, one, it&#8217;s really, really broad. It&#8217;s open to so many different kinds of talents. So we mentioned content, so people that are writers, people that are researchers, that are inquisitive and empathetic, people that are artists, and people that like to make and create, and people that are builders and people that are analytical. And so it&#8217;s just so open to the array of skillsets that it&#8217;s so welcoming, I think, to so many folks left and right-brained that I think it&#8217;s an incredible career. I started out as a graphic designer, but UX really is this thing that is multidisciplinary. Yeah, I think it&#8217;s a really rich field.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I think some of the skills that come to mind for me are there&#8217;s research, there&#8217;s synthesis, there&#8217;s storytelling, there&#8217;s facilitation, there&#8217;s interaction design, there&#8217;s service design, visual design, prototyping, right? These are all things that a user experience designer might be asked to do. And that doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to be an expert in all of them, but chances are you are going to bias us towards one or two of those, and you&#8217;re going to become an expert. You can have a team that has certain expertise in any one of these dimensions or two or three, I think is incredible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s really been interesting how really UX has exploded as a field over the past few years. Of course, you&#8217;ve got General Assembly and you&#8217;ve got other types of boot camps and other programs that are really cranking out UX designers into the industry at the same time as the design industry has gotten more lockstep in with tech. Companies have went from being just strictly visual designed and now being more product-based. And so, the market has changed, and to that end, the workforce has changed to go along with that. So I can see how those possibilities are really there because a UX designer can be called six different things for six different companies.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They could be UX, they could be product, they could be-</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; like you mentioned before, content, things of that nature. And so, it&#8217;s really flexible in that way.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
It is. Yeah, it&#8217;s incredible. And like I said, it&#8217;s welcoming, right? That means it welcomes folks that are the anthropologists and ethnographers. It&#8217;s just a really diverse field. I don&#8217;t know of another one that is as diverse. One other thing it&#8217;s really important to note is there&#8217;s real symmetry between the design process and new ways or progressive ways of learning. The field of education right now is really embracing the design process. You have a question, you go out and get answers to that question. You form a hypothesis, right? You answer that question. You experiment with your solutions. You validate them, and you learn from it. That is the basis of learning, and here is a field that you can do that every single day. Every single day you are applying progressive learning, and you&#8217;re following basically this process. You&#8217;re continually learning throughout your life. And that&#8217;s one thing that I just find really fascinating is that they&#8217;re really the same thing. That&#8217;s incredible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, you&#8217;ve mentioned before about being a graphic designer. To that end, I want to really go back and learn more about your origin story. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I grew up in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. East Side.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;ve got a lot of Ohio folks, specifically Cleveland, on the show. I&#8217;ve even got some family, they&#8217;re in Cleveland, they&#8217;re in Youngstown, they&#8217;re like right around that area. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yes, that&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Cleveland&#8217;s a great design city too.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I think so, yeah, and we always represent. It&#8217;s an incredible town. Well, I grew up drawing. I loved to draw. I loved comics. I grew up creating characters and writing comic books and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh cool.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I think my parents put me in some classes at the Cleveland Institute of Art. They have an industrial design program, so it&#8217;s the first time I saw these models of people making, basically, the cars of the future. I mean, Cleveland Institute of Art is a pretty top-notch school. It&#8217;s affiliated with the Cleveland Museum of Art, which is one of just a handful of world-renowned art museums, something that I was exposed to really early too. So, yeah, it&#8217;s a hidden gem in the Midwest, and a lot of talented people come out of Cleveland.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was first there&#8230; When did I first go to Cleveland? I mean, aside from family stuff, but as a designer, the first time I remember going was in 2014. Yeah, 2014 I went. I spoke at a conference there. Damn, that was seven years ago, Jesus. But I spoke at a conference there. There&#8217;s a local studio there called Go Media, and they had this event called Weapons of Mass Creation. I don&#8217;t know if they still have the event. I don&#8217;t think they do, but every year they would have a number of different panels. It was a multi-day event. They would have live painting. They&#8217;d have break-dancing. It was a whole thing, and that&#8217;s how I really got introduced to Cleveland as a design city. I was like, &#8220;Man, this is great. This is wonderful.&#8221; And got to meet other designers from nearby, from Chicago and from Detroit and stuff like. So it was great. I want to go back to Cleveland once all this pandemic madness stuff is over. But, yeah, sounds like your parents really kind of introduced you to design and exposed you to that early on.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I mean, they knew it was ordained that I was going to do something creative. I mean, I had been drawing since I was maybe two years old, and I would spend hours and fill up sketchbook after sketchbook. I just loved to be creative. Yeah, they just did what they could to expose me to different things. I didn&#8217;t want to be &#8220;a starving artist&#8221; artist. Obviously a stereotype, but I didn&#8217;t know what design was. But I applied to a graphic design program in Cincinnati when I was coming out of high school. So it&#8217;s the University of Cincinnati in graphic design in School of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning and-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, it&#8217;s a mouthful.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
&#8230; really&#8230; Yeah, it is. DAAP is the acronym. But it was an amazing program. I think like many of my experiences, it was serendipitous. I just followed a calling, but I didn&#8217;t know what it was going to turn into. One, it was a five-year program, and two, it had a&#8230; First year was foundation, so you spend that first year with architects and industrial designers and fashion designers all doing the same thing, learning the same fundamentals. And then you break off into your expertise. And two, it had an internship program or a co-op program that wound up being six quarters in the field. So every other quarter I would-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
You wind up working the equivalent of a year and a half before you get out of school. And so that was an incredible experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not saying this to date you, but this is-</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s okay, you can date me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, but I mean, this is in the early nineties, this is really prior to the advent of the personal computer and design really coming into its own through things like CorelDRAW and Photoshop and stuff like that. It sounds like, I mean, that sort of hybrid program of work plus in-class instruction was really good.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I would say anyone looking at design programs should choose or take very seriously programs that have internships, right? Just the amount of autonomy and independence and the amount of clarity I got on what I wanted to do and what I didn&#8217;t want to do was incredible. The other thing is as part of that program you move from city to city. I worked at the National Park Service working on the publications and brochures that they use in the national parks. I worked in St. Louis at a retail doing design for retail. I worked in Dallas, Texas doing environmental graphics at an architectural firm. And then I worked at a small but cutting-edge design studio in Boston. Every quarter I was moving to a city, finding an apartment, and either living with other students or living on my own and had a full-time job. I mean, it was incredible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s really any design program like that now that really put you out there as a working designer while you&#8217;re still in school in that way.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, I think there are a handful, and they&#8217;re definitely worth you tracking down. I&#8217;ll any day hire someone from Cincinnati as an intern or full-time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How was your early career post-graduation because it sounds like you&#8217;ve managed to gain a good bit of work experience while still being a student?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. I definitely didn&#8217;t want to stay in Cincinnati. I came out of high school in &#8217;90 and from 1995 was an undergrad. When you&#8217;re from Ohio, you do a few things. You either stay in Ohio, you move to New York, Atlanta, or Chicago. And so, I started applying to jobs in Atlanta and Chicago. I had some family in Chicago. I actually wound up a conference for The Organization of Black Designers. It was the first one, it was held in Chicago. Through that, I think I wound up landing some contract work in Chicago. So I went ahead and moved to Chicago. And then while in Chicago, I attended at a conference, and that really got me connected to a number of opportunities. But that was a really pivotal moment for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The Organization of Black Designers, wow. Revision Path and OBD kind of have a&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t want to say a history, that makes it sound contentious. But since I&#8217;ve started the show and I&#8217;ve been talking to people, the organization has definitely come up several times. I&#8217;ve tried to get David to even come on the show. But we&#8217;ve had other past folks that have been on the show, we did a whole oral history of OBD back in&#8230; Wait, when was that? 2018, I think, something like that. I mean, it&#8217;s just amazing hearing about how that organization came about it and really how many people it helped out because it&#8217;s something that I don&#8217;t think a lot of black designers even know about because it&#8217;s hard to really pin down-</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; that history. It&#8217;s not a story that&#8217;s like AIGA or something like that. I mean, you tell me because you were around, was OBD for the black designer back then?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
For me, I mean, one, I was probably maybe one, maybe two black students in my cohort, right? At least I would say I identified as black and that I was making it really clear I&#8217;m black. I kind of led with that. But very few in the design program in Cincinnati, very few&#8230; In all the internships, I was probably the only black person in all the internships, maybe one that I interacted with in the corporate environment. And then moving to Chicago and working at these firms, just seeing so few black designers. So this is the first time in my life I stood in a room and saw hundreds of black people that were creative that were just like me, and fashion, art, graphic, industrial design, you name it, architects. To do that for the first time is transformative. You just realize you&#8217;re not alone.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
So I think that&#8217;s what it did for me, just make me feel a sense of belonging in a way that I had never felt before and realize even if I do go back into these other spaces and I go to my nine to five at this company over here where I&#8217;m still the only black person, I know we&#8217;re out there, and I&#8217;m validated by that. I know I have a lifeline to them. I can always touch base with them. A lot of what I was doing was taking the people on that list and calling them up and saying, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m looking for work.&#8221; So a lot of it was pre-Linkedin, just using that network to see if you can make inroads and either get a job with them or have them refer you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But right around that time, you also got involved and helped co-create something called Project Osmosis. Can you talk about that?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, this is part of the oral history of OBD. I think I had the fortune of meeting some of the folks that after that initial conference in Chicago, there are designers there that convened themselves on a regular basis from that point on and kind of became the Chicago chapter of OBD. And that was led by Vernon Lockhart. You met with him before. He really helped coalesce a team of folks that we call ourselves OBD, Chicago, and we were representing OBD and that chapter. And so I was attracted to that group, so I joined them and had other friends that joined. And so, we got really close and just really bonded and tried to carry on the legacy of the larger org to both network, but then also to try to do some more outreach to the community and primarily to younger folks.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
And so, that outreach was through University of Illinois Chicago. We were doing programs either with students there or through local high schools, middle schools. I also did a little bit of internal visioning and journeying and we together came up with this idea of more like an outreach, like a consistent outreach to creative youth that would eventually enter the design community. And so, the idea was we know that there are creative folks out there that have this innate talent and they probably don&#8217;t see any pathway for themselves, right? They don&#8217;t see that there are these fields out there, these roads to success that they could take, and using their talent something that they could have fun and in joy every day.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
We wanted to expose more and more creative kids to these fields, to industrial design, fashion design, graphic, architecture, et cetera, and so we decided to create a program around it. There was this woman named Lisa Moran, Keith Purvis, Vernon Lockhart, Marti Parham. There&#8217;s a number of other folks, I don&#8217;t want to leave them out, but we basically came up with this idea of Project Osmosis. And that was, of course, these kids learning from the design professionals, and that was the genesis. We actually converted OBD Chicago into Osmosis. And that was its next incarnation; we were no longer OBD.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And shout-out to Vernon Lockhart. I mean, he is still keeping.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Oh my gosh, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; Project Osmosis going to this day.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
To this day. Shout-out to him. Wow. So you were working for a few different design studios back then doing a lot of graphic design work. What do you remember the most about being a working designer from that time?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny you mentioned the adoption of computers. I would say I was in my second year in college when we were using Mac computers and Adobe software. I was using those all through college and in my internships as well. And so, yeah, most of my work then going out, I would kind of&#8230; I think the first year or so I was a freelancer and I would use my network to see who&#8217;s looking for a designer, and I would join these small studios. There was a studio called Metaphor. There&#8217;s a number of others I can&#8217;t even remember right now. Pivot Design. I would just go work with them for a few months and work on mostly corporate communications and things for whatever local restaurants, whatever, doing mostly print work. But I wound up working at a small web design shop for the first time. They were working on websites, and that&#8217;s when websites and web marketing was just taking off. So this is 1997, &#8217;96, &#8217;97. And yeah, that&#8217;s when I started learning web design at this place called Streams Online Media. No longer around. And then I wound up joining a company called Giant Step, which was the digital arm of Leo Burnett, a larger ad agency, and so made my way into web design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s hard to overstate just how much of&#8230; There was nothing back then of web design.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
True. True.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There were maybe a couple of books, but even those felt like they were being written on the fly. There was just a lot of view source and figuring it out.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely, especially when it came to digital design. Digital design, it was a gamble, right? The paradigm for designers was you&#8217;re a graphic designer. You either work at either a large graphic design agency or you work at an advertising agency. And then you eventually become a creative director, right? Your Paul Rand was the prototype for your career. But I think digital, really those larger agencies didn&#8217;t have experience in that. So it was really the small tech companies and webshops and things like that that were really starting to hire designers and do groundbreaking work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because they could move faster because they were smaller.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember, let&#8217;s see, &#8217;97. I was in high school in &#8217;97, and I remember that&#8217;s when I got my first HTML book. We had went to a&#8230; Was it a Walden Books?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Walden, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It was Walden. We went to Walden Books in Montgomery. I&#8217;m from Selma, but Montgomery&#8217;s 50 miles away, so we went to Walden Books and got this big HTML book. It was orange. It was like a thousand-page book. I don&#8217;t know, back then, they had a bunch of books like this for different languages. There was one for HTML, one for ASP, different things like that. And I remember this big, huge thousand-page book, and I would carry that around with me at school. And whenever I got a chance to go to the like&#8230; We had a supercomputer lab in my high school, and we had computers in the library. Whenever I had free time, I would just go in with that book and I had a Tripod account, and I would just start trying to figure out like, &#8220;What does the blink tag do? What does the marquee tag do?&#8221; Just trying to figure out how it works. Because it&#8217;s one thing to see it in the book, but then to actually do it on the web and see how it works in real time, to me that was just such a transformative time in learning design. Because really there were no rules.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You really could do what you wanted to do.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. And this is also when so many of those other roles were starting to enter the field, right. You might be a graphic designer who was usually doing comps and mock-ups and doing layout for, let&#8217;s say, posters or books or write other corporate communications that was like a&#8230; we&#8217;ll say layout, but then there were people who were technologists, right? There were people who are anthropologists who were becoming information architects. And so yeah, just sociologists and cognitive psychologists. So that now as a designer, you&#8217;re starting to interact with these people. They&#8217;re also people with backgrounds in motion design and film design, and so they were starting to come together at these companies. And so that was really interesting, was just now interfacing with such a range of creative people, whereas as a graphic designer you might interact with a photographer and maybe an illustrator. But yeah, really interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I would say for of those of us, like designers that are probably 40 and up, to really see how the entire design community has changed from those early days in the nineties to now, it&#8217;s been really inspiring to see just how much things have changed.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. That is why I also say that UX or user experience is such an amazing field is just because it is really on the cusp of that Moore&#8217;s Law of continual transformation and change. It&#8217;s almost as if design is becoming something new, and UX is sort of, I think, on the forefront of that. So the fact that it&#8217;s, yeah, it&#8217;s constantly growing and changing it&#8217;s really exciting. It has a continual frontier, right? There&#8217;s a continual green field in front of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now even with all the design work that you&#8217;ve done over the years, you also have your own side business, side project that you do that&#8217;s called Properganda. How did that come about?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a great question and great timing for that question because what we&#8217;re talking about right now, this moment for me was a time when I stopped doing that kind of work. So when I was an undergrad, I kind of&#8230; Really short story here, when I was an undergrad, I did really well my first year, my second year in school I started to get really just uninspired and really had a hard time understanding how&#8230; I was this black kid. I&#8217;m pretty much the only one in my program, there&#8217;s one every year in the program. Really felt isolated. How is Gestalt psychology and semiotics, and how are these things&#8230; Will they have anything to do with me, all these Western theories and things?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
And so, I even had a professor approach me and say&#8230; I had a really hard end-of-year review, and he pulled me aside and said, &#8220;I look around the city, and I see so many black folks basically. But then I look in the program and you&#8217;re really the only one. I would think that you would want to essentially represent your race&#8230; or represent your race better.&#8221; One, he was not black so I had no [inaudible 00:47:33].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Of course.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
[crosstalk 00:47:33].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s pretty wild to say. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I mean, it was a jaw-dropping moment for me. And from that point on, I was singed by that, like really burnt by that. But we had a project shortly after that where we had to take a word and manipulate it and have it mean something else, a typographic study. Something clicked at me and for some reason, I chose the word Thanksgiving. I started playing with the letters in the word.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I started with red letters, and I changed one letter to white and another letter to white and another one and then started making the red letters disappear, and it started to simulate population. I started thinking about the reds and the whites and how whites move in and reds start dying off. And at the end I added, I just added an E to both words and wound up with the words take and give. And there was white take and red give at the end. So it was really just repeating the word Thanksgiving and changing the color of one letter each row. So the statement was obviously about colonization, about gentrification&#8230; well, not gentrification but genocide essentially and the Holocaust, American colonization, and was through a typographic study. And that was the first time I realized, &#8220;Oh, I can use the tools they&#8217;re teaching me to make the statements I want to make.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
And from that point on, it took off for me. I really loved visual pun. I really loved to use really simple graphics to make a really hard-hitting statement. And so the rest of my career there in undergrad was really making really cutting, really socially critical statements in my work. And that was my way of pushing back on that professor and basically on my cohort.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
It was really liberating for me. That&#8217;s what got me excited about design, was that I can use this craft to make a statement. Most designers, you&#8217;re meant to be objective, you&#8217;re not meant to make a statement. You&#8217;re meant to channel, right? This was my ability to communicate. So of course, I graduated. I went into the workforce, entered corporate America, and I stopped doing that kind of work. And that was around the time we talked about when I moved to Chicago and started working in health. So fast forward probably 15 years, I was working at a startup. I was a lead of design and really uninspired. I was really unhappy. I was burnt-out. For those years, I knew that I was not fully self-expressed.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
One night, I took out some of the old pieces that I worked on. The first one I took out was Thanksgiving, and I just updated it. I redesigned it, refined it. And that was really me getting in touch with that old self through the craft of just reworking those pieces. I picked up another one and started reworking and kind of updating it. And then from there, I started making new pieces, and they were usually some critical statements. An obvious, easy target is social media. That&#8217;s one that I have a love/hate relationship with. So started making lots of pieces around social media and its impact on us.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
That was it. I just was creating for the sake of creating, and it really breathed life back into me. I was up until 3, 4, 5 o&#8217;clock in the morning, multiple nights just not being able to stop creating. That was kind of the genesis and coming back to that idea of Properganda. I had come up with that nomenclature in the nineties, and so I decided to bring it back and say, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to build something around this.&#8221; So Properganda it was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Properganda, I like that because, of course, back then, proper was part of slang back then saying something was proper. I&#8217;m curious, have you heard of the book Visual Puns in Design?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Eli Kince.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yes, yes. Yeah. Tell me, how&#8217;s that top of mind for you?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, God, a few years ago, I was really seeking out design books by black designers.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Wow. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I got his book. Saki Mafundikwa has a book called Afrikan Alphabets that is super hard to find, and I managed to get that. And yeah, that&#8217;s how I first found out about it.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s my jam. When someone can use the visual image to break expectation or to change perception and change meaning, I just think it&#8217;s so brilliant. He&#8217;s actually a University of Cincinnati alumni.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah, so he went to my school, he went through my same program, and he probably had that same instructor. Yeah, I love that sort of compendium of work that he collected there. I actually reached out to him maybe a few years ago when I picked Properganda back up. I was compelled to reach out and try to meet him. I think we chatted for a little bit through email. But, yeah, that&#8217;s so interesting you bring that up because that&#8217;s a really, I think, a great north star for me. Really impressed with this brother who, who was from my neck of the woods, basically,</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m going to try to get him on the show. I reached out to him a few years ago too, and I think we were trying to get something going but he was busy at the time. So I&#8217;m going to try to pick that back up because that is a really good book. And for folks that are listening, you may be able to find it on eBay or Etsy. Because I don&#8217;t even know if it&#8217;s still in print, but I know that there are some copies of it floating around if you&#8217;re trying to find it.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yes. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it sounds like having Properganda as that side project really helped fulfill you as a creative, even as you did your regular nine to five work.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I think it was I became really aware that my full-time work was not enough for me to be fully self-expressed and be fully self-actualized, and it was only going to be through doing that work that I would be my whole self. So from that point, it&#8217;s been a great ride. I mean, it&#8217;s hard. Like I said, I was compelled to do all that work. So I created a lot of work and lots of hours. I&#8217;m a full-time parent and have a full-time job. And so to do this as well, it&#8217;s a commitment. But yeah, it&#8217;s a part of me that has to be expressed otherwise I&#8217;m not fully myself.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
A lot of it is really not only just I have to create, I want to have that experience of creating. Because as a design leader and a manager, I create so little nowadays, right? I create success through teams, and my design is really people and their careers. And so then it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, but I still want to make things.&#8221; And so this gives me ability to do that. I call myself and this work the armchair activist, the person who walks through life, knowing that things aren&#8217;t quite right and just knowing something&#8230; It&#8217;s that whole matrix, right? You know that things aren&#8217;t right, but they need that tipping point. They need something to say, &#8220;Hey, look,&#8221; like nudge them and say, &#8220;You should be questioning this phone that you&#8217;re staring at for 10 hours a day. You should be questioning the things that you&#8217;re consuming. You should just think critically about your own behavior and how these things shape your behavior. So that what that&#8217;s based on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a designer I had on the show a few years back, his name is Andre Hueston Mack. He is a designer who had some experience in the financial industry but then later became world-class sommelier and now has his own brand of wines. They&#8217;re called Mouton Noir or Black Sheep Wines. His design, I don&#8217;t want to say it&#8217;s something similar to what you&#8217;re doing, but he also does these visual pun sort of designs as well. His design studio is called the Get Fraiche Cru, but fresh is spelled F-R-A-I-C-H-E like creme fraiche, and then cru is C-R-U, as in a vineyard because he does the wine. Actually, for people that are listening and for you too as well, if you all want to go to Bon Appetit&#8217;s YouTube channel, I know that that has had its own controversy, but if you go to Bon Appetit&#8217;s YouTube channel, he&#8217;s done a series of videos where he talks about wine and stuff so you can get to see his personality and stuff like that. But if folks want to check him out, I think he&#8217;s episode like&#8230; I want to say 313 or something like that, Andre Mack. It&#8217;s in the 310s from what I remember. I tend to remember pretty well who does what when. It&#8217;s a weird quirk, but if folks want to take that episode out, 313, it&#8217;s pretty good.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Thank you for sharing that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So between Properganda and the work that you do with Zillow and everything, and even, I guess, throughout your career, how have you worked to stay your authentic self?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Well, I think Properganda is part of my authentic self, so even manifesting that. One, acknowledging it, &#8220;Hey, I need to pay attention to this aspect of my personality, and two, I need to feed it, and I need to make it public and build it around it.&#8221; Acknowledging that in myself, and I think that&#8217;s advice I would give to everyone, listening. I do a lot of internal listening. I usually do visioning exercises at least once every two years. And that&#8217;s to check in with myself on, &#8220;Okay, what experiences you want to be having and what skills do you want to be developing?&#8221; And so, Properganda is a manifestation of that. It&#8217;s like that happened in order for me to be whole.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I think at work, a lot of it is around&#8230; Working from home was a milestone, something that I wanted to achieve. I just had the good fortune of things making that the case. For me, going into an office, commuting for three hours a day or four hours a day is not sustainable even though I&#8217;ve done it for 15 years. And so, having a better integration of home and life because home is the authentic me, so integrating that, that puzzle piece has fall fallen into place but that&#8217;s been important.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I think also you talked a little bit about the last two years and not just the pandemic, but all of this sort of&#8230; I don&#8217;t call it social up upheaval, but it was just folks tired and pushing and being vocal. Whether it&#8217;s the protest or the election or whatever, but they&#8217;re the real issues about equity in our country and race. Those issues now have become part of the discourse at work and/or on in day to day. Now people are talking about things that they would rarely talk about or in spaces that they would rarely talk about. And so that is really important to maintain that. Now if I&#8217;m at work, we will talk about being a black designer or a black design leader or being a black male or a black woman or a black trans person, all of the diaspora and all of the issues that go with that, those are now part and parcel of the things that we talk about in work in our daily lives.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
So being authentic to that and putting words to that is really essential. I think I spent many years compartmentalize my blackness from work. And so, now that&#8217;s what part of being my authentic self and bringing that authentic self to work is that we can talk about aspects of my identity, other people can talk about aspects of their identity, and then we can talk about these things that go along with that. One thing is also working on things that are relevant to my own interests. Zillow is really pushing to create a social impact agenda and initiatives that are focused on changing paradigms in the housing industry and the fact that housing is kind of key center point around inequity, especially in [inaudible 01:00:47] communities. So being able to participate in work and help steer work, that&#8217;s focused on creating social impact, like doing that also is a part of my full-time job. It&#8217;s not just about paying the bills but being able to move certain boulders that are important to me in my life and then also being more and more myself. Those are the things I really push for, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Do you feel satisfied creatively these days?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I do. I do. I think my biggest challenge right now is probably I want to do so much more and there&#8217;s just so little time. The last year was tough because the kids were home during the day, so we were working and we were parenting. And so by the end of the day, it&#8217;s just like, &#8220;I&#8217;m done like toast.&#8221; And so, there wasn&#8217;t a lot of bandwidth to do other things. Now the only thing that limits me in terms of my happiness with being creatively expressed is just time. But I now have the things that I know I love to do. And so, yeah, I would say the answer is yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you want the next chapter of your life to be like? Where do you see yourself in the next few years? What kind of work do you want to be doing, projects, stuff like that?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
I think in the future I want to work to live, not live to work. And so that means that I want to work smarter not harder. I want to work on things that I&#8217;m really good at and do that with ease. And then I want to be able to take advantage of the benefits of my accumulated knowledge and expertise. So if I&#8217;ve worked for 25-plus years, I should be able to take the foot off the gas. And so, to be honest with you, it&#8217;s less about what new kinds of work I want to do and more about the balance I want to strike between work and life. I want to do less of busy work and logistics and administration and less churn and more generative and creative, and then also connecting with my family. I know that doesn&#8217;t directly answer your question, but, yeah, that&#8217;s the goal.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
They can find me on LinkedIn, so Eric Bailey. I think you&#8217;ll share some links there. I&#8217;m Properganda1, the number one, on Instagram, and then propergandadesign.com is a website for Properganda. Yeah, and there&#8217;s zillow.com. So you can obviously connect with Zillow and all the great things we have there for folks that are looking for a home, whether they&#8217;re renting or buying. And let&#8217;s see. Yeah, I think that&#8217;s not a huge digital footprint, but those are the things I keep it to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Eric Bailey, I want to thank you just so much for coming on the show. Thank you for, I mean one, sharing your story about how you really have become a designer and have made your way up in your career, but also really sharing how you&#8217;ve been able to balance these parts of yourself, whether it&#8217;s doing Properganda on the side, whether you&#8217;re building your teams. It sounds like you&#8217;re continually striving to have that sense of balance among the creative and the professional and the personal aspects of your life. And I think that&#8217;s something that all of us listening can really learn from. So thank you so much for coming on the show, I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Eric Bailey:</b><br>
Maurice, my pleasure. Thank you. I&#8217;m really honored, yeah, just to be a part of a illustrious cohort of interviews, so thank you so much.</p>

<p>This week on Revision Path, I&#8217;m sharing my conversation with visual storyteller Fred Noland. You might have seen <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/fred-noland" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">his recent illustration work in <em>The New Yorker</em></a>, but he&#8217;s been featured in newspapers, magazines and museums throughout his extensive career.</p>
<p>We talked about navigating work and creativity during this pandemic, and he spoke on an ongoing project of his ‚Äî a graphic novel about professional cyclist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Taylor" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Major Taylor</a>. We also discussed representation in comics, his artistic influences, and his podcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOxEVwG64aCeRvY7O97iowu7ZVPK2K08Y" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Serious Moonlighting</a>. Fred&#8217;s voice and his work are an important addition to the world of visual storytelling, and I hope we&#8217;ll see and hear more from him in the future!</p>
