Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>While the current creative industry tends to favor specialists, multidisciplinary creators like Reggie Perry Jr. know that being a generalist is what truly helps you stand out. He does it all &#8212; graphic design, photography, video and audio production, motion graphics and 3D, and a whole lot more! </p>
<p>Reggie told me about his work as a media experience designer at The Home Depot, and from there we talked about showcasing his skills through his own agency (Phox and Phoe) along with NYC-based creative and design studio The Future In Black. We also discussed some of his early career work for agencies, and he shared his tips on balancing creative work with family, as well as how he handles burnout and stays motivated to create so many self-initiated projects. </p>
<p>According to Reggie, with a plan and hard work, you can accomplish your creative goals. Now that&#8217;s some great advice!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
My name is Reggie Perry. My day job is Media Experience Designer at The Home Depot, and I also have a design agency that I do a lot of my freelance work through. That work includes a lot of motion graphics and animation work, video editing, photography, things of that nature. Pretty much across the board, creativity, even sometimes music production as well. Just a lot of different things that I do and have my hands in and kind of keeps it interesting for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s 2023 been treating you so far?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
2023 has been pretty good. A lot of good opportunities coming my way, which I&#8217;m grateful for and been working towards for several years now. So far so good and looking forward to seeing what the rest of the year brings.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have any plans for the upcoming Summer?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I do have some projects that are going to be released later in the Summer that I worked on earlier in the year. The people that I worked on those four, those should be coming out mid-Summer. I&#8217;m really excited to see where those go and what they do. Other than that, my day-to-day work and creating my own projects as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Let&#8217;s talk about your work at The Home Depot as a media experience designer. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve heard that title, but then again I feel like there&#8217;s a lot of titles these days that are, I guess they just represent different facets of design. When I came up, it was like you were a graphic designer, web designer, web developer, et cetera. Tell me, what is a media experience designer? What do you do at The Home Depot?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
In my role, I&#8217;m within the learning department, which is under the HR umbrella. Pretty much anytime someone joins the company, whether it&#8217;s in the store, whether it&#8217;s on the corporate side, supply chain, pretty much across the board, they have their training. It might be the orientations, it might be how to drive a forklift, it might be how to ring up a customer. Our responsibility is to work with the SMEs and the instructional designers to create the visual aspects of that. That&#8217;s photography, that can be shooting interviews, that can be motion graphics and animation, that could be creating job aids and just graphic design work. It pretty much touches on a lot of different aspects of design and just to basically support those associates across the organization.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. We just had someone on the show a few episodes ago, I don&#8217;t know if you might be familiar with them, but I think he also worked in education, Brandon Campbell-Kearns. Does that name sound familiar?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, the name sounds familiar for sure, but I&#8217;m not completely familiar.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Not that I expect all black designers at The Home Depot to know each other. I was like, &#8220;Well, he&#8217;s in Atlanta. He&#8217;s kind of worked in education.&#8221; But no, that sounds really, really interesting. So you&#8217;re kind of part of this overall education that&#8217;s responsible for, I guess, getting people onboarded and just learning about different parts and facets of working at Home Depot, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, that as well as just ongoing learning. Whether it&#8217;s compliance training or if it&#8217;s a new best practice that rolls out, whether it&#8217;s surveys, it could be pretty much anything. We just work with all these different aspects of the business to create the visual aspects for them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does the team look like? You mentioned there&#8217;s some subject matter experts, some content people. What does that team usually look like?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I&#8217;m a part of the media team, so basically there is four of us and we&#8217;re all responsible for creating those visual assets. Then, an instructional designer or SME will come to us and say, &#8220;Hey, we have this project, we want to have these deliverables. What do you think would be best? What can it look like? What&#8217;s possible?&#8221; Then we kind of work with them to figure that out. Then we&#8217;ll schedule the shoots, or if I&#8217;m doing a motion graphic, it&#8217;s like, okay, they&#8217;ll send me the script, we&#8217;ll go over the scripts, figure out what assets we need, and then I build out that motion graphic. It pretty much just depends on the ask that we get. Then once they ask us, we kind of interface with these different people to create the final deliverable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like you probably have a steady stream of work that&#8217;s coming in because you&#8217;re doing it across the organization for a number of different initiatives or reasons or things like that,</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
It also ebbs and flows. For instance, this time of the year when people start going on vacation and stuff around Christmas time, it&#8217;s a little slow, and then sometimes it&#8217;ll be just nonstop back to back projects. It does ebb and flow, but there&#8217;s always consistent work. It&#8217;s cool because we actually get to see the work that we do out in the field. If we go into a store and somebody&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I just did this training, you did that? That&#8217;s pretty cool.&#8221; Or something like that. If we should an interview in a supply chain facility, and then that&#8217;s on the internal TV channel that&#8217;s on in up in all the facilities, that&#8217;s also cool as well. There&#8217;s a lot of different ways that our work gets out there and a lot of different aspects that we touch.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;ve been there for what, almost eight years now it looks like. How did you get started?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
2015. When I was working for this company called Digital Sherpa, they actually got bought out, I forget the name of the company. Yes, they&#8217;re actually in Atlanta, but oh, it&#8217;s CoStar. They got bought out by CoStar, so they closed down this whole section of the business. I was just looking for my next opportunity, and I had actually got into photography that Spring, so I was just shooting and shooting and shooting. Then actually my wife, who was my girlfriend at the time, her coworkers uncle was at Home Depot and they were looking for a content creator. I applied and she kind of did the introduction and then the rest is history. That&#8217;s kind of how I got on board. And that was within Crown Bolt, which is a subsidiary of Home Depot. They do door hinges and handles and shelf brackets and things like that. That&#8217;s where I started. Then after two and a half years I transitioned over to the learning team.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
As a content creator, were you doing pretty similar things to what you do now?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Basically, around that time was when there was a huge push for Home Depot to get all of their skews to have lifestyle photos and to have alternative angles for the images and to have videos on how to install these things. A lot of my work at that time was say if there was shelf brackets, here&#8217;s all the shelf brackets. We actually had a wall that was built with the drywall and everything, and we&#8217;d set everything up and then I would take pictures of it and then we&#8217;d change out the brackets and take pictures of that, and those will all be up on the website under the skew so you can see different angles and closeups and how to install it and things like that. That was more of the work I was doing at that time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a lot of, I guess now is this instructional work, because you mentioned this is on the website, so it&#8217;s under different products as well. Right?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Especially if you go to any e-commerce site and you look and they have seven or eight different images. One might be a video, one might be some of the directions, and then two or three may be different angles or different color options. I was creating those images basically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Okay. I think it&#8217;s good to sort of hear that this is a position that people actually do. I think when you look at different big box retail type sites, say maybe a Target or a Walmart, you might not think that all of those different photos and things like that are done in house. I think it&#8217;s good that people know that this is a type of position that you can do that&#8217;s still kind of in the realm of design at least.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
And even with Home Depot, there&#8217;s like a facility that&#8217;s south of Atlanta and pretty much most of the products that are sold in Home Depot, say it&#8217;s a Samsung refrigerator, they may send one of those refrigerators down there and they have this whole studio with cameras that&#8217;s going to capture images from 360 degrees. And then it&#8217;s like, have you ever seen those images of where the drawers would come out or the doors were open and you can kind of rotate it? They do that kind of stuff there as well. Even with that of building out a studio and shooting these products and then make turning them into 3D models and all that kind of stuff, there&#8217;s a lot of different positions and jobs around basically e-commerce and the imagery around it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Product imagery in general, I think in tech design, retail, et cetera, a lot of that is super important. And I think it&#8217;s good to know that one, it&#8217;s an in-house type of thing that you do, but it also sounds like it can be never ending because there&#8217;s probably always new products or like you said, the work you do now filters out into education within the organization, so there&#8217;s no shortage it sounds like, of work to do, which is a good thing, especially in this age of job security right now with layoffs and stuff. It sounds like you&#8217;re pretty set.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, it is never ending for sure. I remember in 2015-16, and I&#8217;m sure all the designers who are familiar with Photoshop will understand this, but it was like at that time I had to shoot every piece of plumbing hardware. If you go into Home Depot and there&#8217;s an aisle and it&#8217;ll have a thousand pieces of all these different just hoses and just all these different metal pieces and stuff, and I had to shoot all of those, and it was right before the AI got good enough to do the selection on its own without the pen tool. I had to go through and use the pen tool on like 2000 images/used the pen tool on 2000 images.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh my God. Wow. It also kind of entails, I guess a bit of bit of production design too, because like you said, you&#8217;re doing this at a time before the tools really were sophisticated enough to be able to make this a easier type of task.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
If I did it now, I would probably just create an action or a script and just run it [inaudible 00:11:43] in an hour.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of which, what is the most challenging thing about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I would say just managing expectations, honestly, because there are limitations to some of the deliverables that we do because a lot of these things will go out to stores across the country. Some might be in more rural areas and may not have the fastest internet, so we have to make sure the files are a certain size or we have to make sure you want to shoot this, but this might require a budget. You don&#8217;t really have a budget, so we need to scale it back. It&#8217;s just kind of figuring out and problem solving, but that&#8217;s kind of what design is anyway, so we have to figure out what&#8217;s the best solution for the learner that&#8217;s going to get the point across in the most efficient way within the tool sets or the parameters that we have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We just talked a little bit about how the tools have gotten more sophisticated. How do things say AI and machine learning and things like that, do those sorts of things factor into the work that you do?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
They do, yeah. Some of the stuff, I&#8217;m actually doing a shoot on next week that we&#8217;re basically recording someone who does product videos and stuff so that we can turn them into an AI avatar. We have to record them with certain specifications and we have to do 15 minutes of video, like HD and all those kind of stuff. We&#8217;re just now starting to get experimenting with it. Some of the videos that we do, they&#8217;ll have AI voiceovers, things like that. For the most part it&#8217;s still kind of low key right now. We&#8217;re just now starting to get into it as far as Home Depot goes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I know we&#8217;re recording this right now at a time where there&#8217;s this big writer strike going on. WGA Union is striking and a lot of writers are striking. One of the sort of things that they want to be addressed by the industry, and I think this kind of maybe spills over into design a bit as well, I just haven&#8217;t seen that many conversations about it, it&#8217;s how do AI tools, et cetera, how do they reshape the work that we&#8217;re doing? Is it replacing it in some way? Is it making it better? Is it making it worse? And just even what you&#8217;re mentioning with this AI avatar and things like that, do you see a future where AI is going to play a more pivotal role in the work that you do?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Honestly, it&#8217;s been around for a long time and it&#8217;s been in a lot of the programs that a lot of us designers are using. Anyway, a year ago I learned Unreal Engine and with the MetaHumans and doing a mesh to MetaHuman and all this stuff, that&#8217;s AI, machine learning that&#8217;s building all that out. You can take a picture of your face and turn yourself into a 3D avatar. There&#8217;s a program that I use called Cascadeur I believe it&#8217;s called, yeah. You basically set your key frames and then it will use AI to interpolate the motion in between it, but also to add the physics to it, realistic physics and things like that. Things like that to me are very, very useful. I think with as far as the image creation and everything, it&#8217;s great for coming up with ideas, but I can also see that it definitely has a look to it, so everything&#8217;s going to kind of start looking the same. You just got to figure out your own way to use it and make your workflow more efficient.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think certainly now with the fact that these tools are so commonplace to use a Midjourney or DALL-E or things like that, and you&#8217;re starting to see larger companies kind of dip their toe into it as well. Microsoft has a tool called Microsoft Designer where you can just sort of put in a prompt and it will generate some AI images. I tried it. Not that good, to be completely honest. It wasn&#8217;t that great. I was like, oh, this is trash. I wasn&#8217;t expecting Rembrandt level work, but I mean, interns could do better work than this. Adobe does something similar. They have Adobe, I think it&#8217;s called Adobe Firefly. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Adobe Firefly that does a similar thing. I agree with you about the look. A lot of the AI art and stuff I&#8217;ve seen has a specific look. Granted, I know that those looks have been cribbed off of actual artists and such, so it&#8217;s not even original in that respect.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how AI plays out with, I think things like say interface design and stuff like that, where there are more set patterns and things that you could probably create complete UI toolkits or something like that just based off of a prompt. I&#8217;m interested to see where this goes. I would love to see more of the digital design community talk about it. I haven&#8217;t seen a lot of talk about it. Maybe I&#8217;m not looking in the right place, but I would love to see more talk about how this sort of influences the work that we do because I&#8217;ve gotten some people that I&#8217;ve had on the show where freelancers, for example, they&#8217;ll say a client may come to them with an image or something that they created in AI and expect the human artist to change it or to make it better or to improve it in some sort of way, which is like, is that what the future&#8217;s going to be? I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s still, I think, a little early to tell kind of how this will really play into the work that we do.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, I did see a video last week, I think it might have been on Vox, and it was this AI artist, which he was doing it in a way that I thought was really cool because what he would do was he would create images, but he would do several different passes of these images and do the in painting and out painting and all this stuff. He was basically putting himself in all these different locations, like he was taking a selfie of himself. He would then take all of these images and put them in the Photoshop and he&#8217;d take different sections of them and mask stuff out and add stuff to it, and then do all the color grading. At the end of it looked like a totally different image, and I thought that was pretty cool and a very unique way to actually use it instead of just saying, &#8220;Here&#8217;s some prompts, here&#8217;s an image, I&#8217;m going to throw some text over it and I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Right now I think we&#8217;re seeing AI start to flood the workplace in different ways. I mean this will affect what we do as creatives ostensibly, but I&#8217;m just going to be interested to see how this plays out because I think the point of mainstream adoption is probably still a bit a ways away, but seeing what&#8217;s happened within the past nine months around the explosion of AI in layman type tools has been just astonishing to see. It reminds me a lot of the early, early web and how those early days in, I don&#8217;t know, early two thousands. Innovations were just happening left. Trying to keep up was wild. You might have been doing something now, but in two weeks that&#8217;s going to be obsolete because now there&#8217;s this new way to do it. It&#8217;s really amazing to see how it&#8217;s changing things now.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, along with this full-time work that you do at the Home Depot, you have this design agency called Phox and Phoe that you started right as the pandemic started in 2020. What brought that on?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, so basically I&#8217;ve always been doing some freelance work for the last 10 or 12 years, and I wanted to just create my own design agency and entity and build that up and build client lists and everything like that. Basically at the beginning of the pandemic, a few clients had hit me up. So that&#8217;s kind of when I started it, just so I can have everything, my paperwork right, my bank account, all that kind of stuff. I named it after two of my kids, Phox and Phoenix, so Phox and Phoe Agency. Basically when I was going into the office, I&#8217;d be getting up at 4:45 because I live a little bit North of Atlanta, and I had to drive all the way an hour to work. So I&#8217;d just get up, go to work, come back, I&#8217;d get home at 5:30, and then I would really wouldn&#8217;t really have any time.</p>
<p>Once the pandemic started and I was at home, I was like, oh, I&#8217;m getting back three or four hours of my day. Let me really dig into this and start to build up my portfolio and build up my client list. At the same time as well, literally probably a month before the pandemic started, I started getting into 3D design. I was like, oh, I got all this time. Let me really dig into it and build and build and build. Now, three years later, three and a half years later, there&#8217;s a lot of opportunities that have come my way. There&#8217;s stuff in the works that I&#8217;m working on right now that it&#8217;s pretty big and it&#8217;s pretty cool to see an idea that I had four or five years ago be a reality in current time. So it was just something I always wanted to do. I just wanted to have my agency and design and make music and shoot videos and photography. So I just made it happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s that been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going pretty good. It&#8217;s pretty consistent for the most part. Of course, it ebbs and flows. It&#8217;s just kind of the nature of freelance. I also don&#8217;t take on work just to take on work. I&#8217;m kind of intentional about the work that I do. I worked really hard over the last 10 or 12 years to be able to ask for the rates that I ask for and all of these kind of things. It&#8217;s like I just don&#8217;t take on any work. For the most part, it&#8217;s pretty good. It&#8217;s an extra stream of income, it&#8217;s a good stream of income. So I have no complaints about it. I think that I&#8217;m about ownership, I&#8217;m about entrepreneurship. That&#8217;s just kind of how I grew up. A lot of the people I grew up around own businesses and things like that. It&#8217;s always just kind of been in me anyway.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think it&#8217;s a great thing to have your own side business, especially when it&#8217;s not something that you&#8217;re 100% completely reliant on. You&#8217;ve got exactly your full-time gig, and so you can be a lot more, I guess picky is probably the best word, but you could probably be a lot more judicious with, as you mentioned, the projects you take on, the clients you work with, because you don&#8217;t have to have this in order to survive. You can pick and choose the type of work that you do.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve definitely been in the position before of trying to grow business and it needed to support me and I needed to survive from it. That could be a very, very stressful. I&#8217;ve been in positions when I had a job and my side stuff started going well, and I quit my job, and then the side stuff wasn&#8217;t going so well. You know what I mean, I&#8217;ve done it. I&#8217;ve pretty much ran the gambit on all that kind of stuff. I could can pick and choose on what I work on. I still pretty much keep the same schedule when I wake up and go to sleep anyway. I don&#8217;t have to commute. I don&#8217;t have to get ready for work, I just walk downstairs. Instead of just sleeping in or doing whatever, I&#8217;ll just work out and then sit down at my computer and use that time where I would be sitting in the car to create and work on side projects and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve definitely been there with my studio before, so I know what it&#8217;s like when it has that kind of ebb and flow. In some years it&#8217;s good, some years it&#8217;s not. I think even with how the industry changes, I&#8217;ve recently kind of started getting back into doing more freelancing because I worked in tech roughly for about the past five years I&#8217;ve worked with different tech startups. After this last layoff, I was like, &#8220;You know what? Let me try to dip my toe back into freelancing and see what I can do.&#8221; I&#8217;m still taking on some projects kind of here and there. It&#8217;s a lot different now doing it in my 40s than when I did it in my twenties.</p>
<p>The good part about it is I can be a bit more, I guess, cautious about who I decide to work with, the types of projects I do, and really sort of what I put my name on. Because that&#8217;s another thing, especially I think with Black creatives is the work that we&#8217;re doing. What is it sort of speaking to in a larger sense? I&#8217;m there with you. I know exactly how you feel.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Definitely. Definitely. Yep.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I was poking around on your Instagram, and I saw this is fairly recently too. You&#8217;re also a part of a agency called The Future Is Black. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
A lot of the stuff that I do that&#8217;s on my portfolio on my Instagram is self-initiated. I basically created a portfolio for the type of work that I want to attract and do in the future. A lot of that&#8217;s just around black culture, specifically around I like the sixties a lot, Malcolm X, James Baldwin, people like that. Just kind of focusing and building around that. Then Joy, who was the owner of The Future Is Black, actually reached out to me maybe about six months ago. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I love this Malcolm X piece that you did. I would love to talk to you more. Let&#8217;s kind of stay in touch. I&#8217;m building something.&#8221;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s been building this and she&#8217;s actually a former makeup artist. She&#8217;s done a lot of different movies and TV shows and fashion design shoots and stuff like that. She&#8217;s kind of getting more into the design agency aspect of things. She reached out to me and was any clients that I have or bring on, would you want to partner with us and you do any of the 3D or motion graphic work? I&#8217;m like, yeah, sure, let&#8217;s do it. She just launched about a week and a half ago and started pushing it out there, and we&#8217;re going to see what&#8217;s going to happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Oh, I appreciate that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you balance all of this? You have the outside freelance work, you&#8217;ve got your 9:00 to 5:00, you also mentioned you have a family and kids. How are you balancing all of this?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
To be honest with you, I just really focus on learning the tools and being efficient, and then also just idea generation. James Altucher actually, I listen to his podcast a lot, just write down five ideas a day or 10 ideas a day. And the more you write them down, the better your ideas will get and the easier you&#8217;ll be able to come up with ideas. I don&#8217;t actually write them down, but I&#8217;m always kind of thinking of stuff, what 3D project can I do? What piece of music can I make? What graphic design or motion graphic project can I do? I&#8217;m always just kind of thinking about what would be cool to make and thinking through it. I kind of think through things in my head before I even sit down at the computer. When I sit down at the computer, because I do have limited time, because I do have a full-time job and I do have children and everything like that, it just kind of pours out.</p>
<p>I might be doing other things like cooking or cutting the grass and I&#8217;m thinking about it so I&#8217;m not thinking about it in front of the computer and getting frustrated. So that&#8217;s kind of how I approach most of my work, to be honest with you. Also, I&#8217;m not going to just take on work for the sake of taking on work. I do want to take on good projects that I&#8217;m excited about. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve been there, you might have taken on a project that you&#8217;re not really excited about, but you just want the money or need the money. It&#8217;s like second day in you&#8217;re like, &#8220;God, I just want this to be over.&#8221; You know what I mean?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s another thing too. If I&#8217;m excited about the project, then the energy comes. Right? If I&#8217;m not, then it kind of drains me and I just don&#8217;t want to be drained. I want to keep my energy up. I want to be working on things that I really want to be working on. That&#8217;s another reason why when I mentioned about building up a portfolio of the kind of work that I want to do, that&#8217;s kind of the purpose behind that. So when opportunities come my way, most of the time there&#8217;ll be things that I&#8217;m actually excited about and want to do instead of things that I have to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I have a hundred percent been there. We can talk about it after the interview, but I have definitely had some projects where it&#8217;s like, look, I got to pay rent, I got to get these bills paid. I might not be excited about it and doing cartwheels in the street, but I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;s work. I&#8217;ll do it. Yeah, I&#8217;ve been there, totally. Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit because I want to learn more about your backstory. You mentioned to me before we started recording that you&#8217;re kind of right outside Atlanta. Are you from just the metro Atlanta area?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I grew up in Hall County, so in Flory Branch, Gainesville area.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
That&#8217;s where from the time I was three until my twenties I was there. I lived out in LA for about three years, but then I came back. Most of my background, most of my history is here in Georgia.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Growing up, were you sort of a really creative kid? I mean, you&#8217;re doing all this stuff now. I imagine that probably started at an early age.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, I was always drawing and stuff, and my dad actually was into computers and stuff when I was growing up. I was on the computer since I was six, and this was before Windows, so C prompts and all that kind of stuff, running MS DOS, putting in floppy discs. I&#8217;ve always been into technology, into art, drawing, taking art classes pretty much my entire life, to be honest with you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You went to Georgia Southern, and then after that you went to the University of North Georgia. How were your college experiences? Did it sort of help prepare you for the work that you do now?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I would say not at all. Georgia Southern was cool. The reason why I transferred, because like you said, you&#8217;re in your 40s. I just turned 40 last year, so if you remember those early 2000s days, if anything about Georgia Southern, it was known for a party school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I was just like, no, I got to try to focus. I was really into music back then and I was like, I just want to just focus on this and not flunk out of school. That&#8217;s why I kind of transferred out. I did learn a lot about networking and meeting people and I&#8217;m just by nature an introvert. So to be in an environment where everybody&#8217;s just like, Hey, what do you do? Or where are you from? And stuff, that was kind of helpful when you first go to school. Because everybody there doesn&#8217;t know anybody. Then I actually linked with a bunch of different people who had similar interests and within music and art and things of that nature. That was helpful. When I went to North Georgia, it was pretty much just go to school, go to work, come home and make music every day. That&#8217;s pretty much all I did.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Were you kind of more into music back then than design?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, I got out of design and creating for maybe about seven or eight years. I was just focused primarily on music. Then around I want to say 2009, 2010 is when I really kind of started getting back into design and digging more into Photoshop and Illustrator and just learning the tools and trying to become more efficient at those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Prior to that, you were just kind of doing music production stuff?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Pretty much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That was a, look, I was in Atlanta during that time. The music scene here was blowing up, really becoming known. I think Atlanta kind of has always been known as a big music city, particularly a big black music city. I just remember during that time there were so many artists coming out of Atlanta across all genres too. I could see how, shit I was actually a musician myself back then and I&#8217;m talking about it. I was a session musician, I played trombone, and so I would sometimes play in some clubs, play a gig here or there. I was doing this kind of alongside my day job. In 2005, I was working for the state of Georgia. Then from 2006 to 2008 I was working AT&#038;T, but then at night I was either doing stuff for school, because I was in grad school or I was playing a gig somewhere. Just the energy in the city, I would say probably that extends out probably throughout the metro area, but certainly in the city. The energy around just the music scene here was so big back then.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. Definitely. The conferences and then it used to be Atlantis and then eventually A3C kind of stemmed from that. Just stuff going on at Apache Cafe and the beat battles and the showcases and stuff. Those were good times for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I played Apache a few times. Yeah, great times. I remember that. Yeah. You were kind of getting into music production, but then you said you got back into design around 2009, 2010. What sort of prompted that shift?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Well, I mean, throughout that time when I was making music, I would need some design work or need to make a flyer or something. I would dabble here and there, but I was never really serious about it. When I started, and I know you mentioned you wanted to speak about this, anyway, so when I started Project Generation D, I started creating all of my own marketing collateral and stuff because the reason why that whole project even came about and company came about was because of 2008, I had just graduated two years before, I had a young child needed some money.</p>
<p>It was almost like now, everybody&#8217;s getting laid off and jobs are hard to find. I had to do something so I created this company to teach kids music production, video production, graphic design, all this kind of stuff. I didn&#8217;t have money to pay anybody to make my logo or marketing collateral, and I had enough knowledge to do it myself. That&#8217;s how it started. Then I would start getting a few freelance clients here and there. I just kind of stuck with it and started building it. I was like, oh, this is going to be a good stream of income and a good way to build upon what I have going on with music. That&#8217;s just kind of how I got more serious about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m looking at the website now for Project Generation D, which is dubbed an afterschool program for children and teens, ages 12 to 17, dedicated to providing students with a positive environment to flourish in the creative digital arts. Yeah, the 2008, I think that was right when the recession happened then. I remember that year vividly because I quit my job that year and started my studio. I was working AT&#038;T, hated it, hated it to the point I thought I had Crohn&#8217;s disease or something because I would physically get sick going into that place to the point where I was like, I can&#8217;t do this anymore.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been there before too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I quit and started. I started my studio in oh eight and we started picking up work in &#8217;09. I continued it since then, but that time was really kind of an interesting time just in terms of opportunity as well as I think particularly I think if you were working in design, it was an interesting time because so much of what was happening in the country around one Obama getting elected, well, I&#8217;d say mainly with Obama getting elected is a lot of his work, I want to say, kind of played to the fact that that great design went into it. If you were a designer kind of working in that space, not even in the political space, but just in design during that time, so many people wanted that same type of polish or execution or diversity to be completely honest around the work that they were doing because they saw what Obama was doing. And this wasn&#8217;t just in politics, this was a cross design. I&#8217;m pretty sure the folks that made the Gotham font probably had dumped trucks of money because everybody wanted to use that damn thing everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Certainly. Yeah, it was definitely an interesting time. Yeah, when times get hard, you have to do what you have to do. If you have those skills, you got to kind of lean on those skills and build what you can to survive. That&#8217;s basically what I did and built upon that since that time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now you mentioned earlier Digital Sherpa, which is where you worked in 2014. When you look back at that time, this is sort of after the Project Generation D time, what do you remember? What were you going through at that time?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
A lot. At that time, so yeah, we got laid off. It was very interesting time because I was producing music all throughout pretty much mainly until 2011, 2012. I actually had a song that blew up and it blew up overseas and had 50, 60 million views on YouTube and all this kind of stuff. it was like I had signed a publishing deal, but it&#8217;s like I didn&#8217;t see any checks yet or anything like that. The business basically shuttered, had $40,000 of debt, moved into an old department, was just looking for job all the time, couldn&#8217;t get a job. I actually ended up getting a job at Sherpa, and then I was also tutoring at the same time. I&#8217;d go to work 8:00 to 4:00, 8:00 to 5:00, and then I would go get a snack or something or a quick meal, and then I&#8217;d go tutor from 6:00 to 9:00 PM every day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I was kind of just doing that, just trying to build. At that same time too, is when I started really digging into After Effects as well. It&#8217;s like, oh, I think this After Effects thing has some potential, if I can really figure it out and learn it, because it&#8217;s a little bit, it&#8217;s graphic design, but it&#8217;s like motion. I like the motion aspect of it. At that time, I ended up getting that job, and it was when blogs were really, really big still. Companies were like, &#8220;I need a blog. I need a blog. I need blog posts.&#8221; So basically the first position I had was, I think it was content manager. We contract out writers and then they would write blogs and I would proofread them and make sure they were good to go for all the clients that we had.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s mostly small businesses from around the country. Then I moved over to account manager, which was just kind of interfacing with the clients and things like that. Pretty much most of my day to day was just kind of overseeing content, making sure the blogs were getting written, they were correct, and getting posted and dealing with any issues that the clients had. It was just 2014-15 was really just a time of hustle for me, to be honest with you. I had the job, but I was also tutoring and I was also trying to design more. I would come home if I wasn&#8217;t tutoring at night and be trying to make art pieces and stuff and figure out Illustrator more and Photoshop more. During that time, it was kind of like a blur, but it was a hard time. It was, in retrospect, kind of a good time because it really laid the foundation for my life now 9 or 10 years later. Man,</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Much of what you are mentioning is my story as well. I had my studio back then, but I was also teaching and I was writing and I was consulting. I was doing multiple different things to try to keep the income coming in, keep myself creatively kind of satisfied and stuff. And it was also really coming at a time where the industry was changing. I would say roughly about 10 years ago might have been the start of when we started to see so much UX. I feel like that&#8217;s when we started to see UX and product really begin as a viable option for designers. Like you said, we&#8217;re roughly around the same age.</p>
<p>In the early two thousands, even say mid to late two thousands, you were either a graphic designer, a web designer, or a web developer. Then as the industry matured and changed, you have all these different type of design that pop up. Different titles go with it. There&#8217;s different titles with different companies. If I tell people I&#8217;m a designer now in 2023, they might automatically think I&#8217;m a product designer or UX designer as opposed to say a visual designer or something like that. So yeah, that time there was a lot about hustle, but the hustle came because there were just so many opportunities to do different things because that&#8217;s what the industry allowed you to do. It allowed you to wear a lot of different hats in that way.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
No, I remember 2015 or so going to the general assembly open house for the UX course, I was considering that at the time. It was a very interesting time. There was a lot of different avenues that you could take. Now a lot of these positions and jobs are commonplace, but at the time it was like, &#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s UX? What exactly does a product designer do?&#8221; That was where I was at at that time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when you look at what you&#8217;re doing now compared to what you kind of did then, I&#8217;m curious how do you handle creative burnout or periods of low motivation? Because I would imagine all of this, like I said before, takes its toll. When you look back then and then you look at what you&#8217;re doing now, have you managed any sort of strategies or ways to pull yourself up during these times of burnout or low motivation?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, honestly I think that it&#8217;s okay to have low motivation. You&#8217;re not going to be going at a hundred percent all the time. Instead of forcing it in those moments, usually what I&#8217;ll do is just step away. If I don&#8217;t feel like making some 3D piece, I cook a lot. Cooking is a form of art. I&#8217;ll do that or exercise, or I&#8217;ll just catch up on a TV show or play some video games, and then I&#8217;ll see something in a TV show or a video game, or I&#8217;ll come across something and it will just spark some creativity and then I&#8217;ll go back and build off of that.</p>
<p>At this point, after creating for so long, I just try not to force it. It&#8217;s going to come in spurts. You&#8217;re going to have times of very high productivity. You&#8217;re going to have times where everything you make, you just want to just smash your computer because you hate it. It&#8217;s just part of the game. I think that&#8217;s just kind of how we are as humans. Everything we make isn&#8217;t going to be great, but you just have to learn how to manage what works for you and figure out some routines or steps that you take to get out of those funks to get back to creating again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a really good piece of advice I think for folks now that might be trying to figure out what is the best way to manage themselves through all of this. Because you know mentioned you started your agency at the beginning of the pandemic. I feel like that pandemic period, particularly with people working at home kind of unlocked something in them to say, &#8220;Oh, wait a minute, I could also do this.&#8221; I think so many folks started getting on TikTok really back then, and now they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, well you know what? I was doing this nine to five, but I could be a content creator.&#8221; Which I kind of have beef with that term in general because I feel like it glosses over so many different skills and specialties within the realm of content creation. Sometimes it can even be used as a misnomer. If you tell someone you&#8217;re a content creator, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, wait, so do you do a podcast? Do you do OnlyFans?&#8221; What does that mean if you say I&#8217;m a content creator? It&#8217;s such a broad kind of term.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, I&#8217;m glad you said about a pandemic, because I viewed it that way since pretty much day one. And I mean, I&#8217;ve told my wife, and I&#8217;ve told a lot of my friends as well, I&#8217;m just like, I&#8217;ve been waiting for a time, not for people to be sick or to pass away or anything like that, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but as far as the opportunity to invest a massive amount of time into something to grow a skill, because you got to think when the pandemic started, you got to think of all the phases that people went through just on a broad level. There was GameStop and then there was Crypto, then there was the Metaverse. Now there&#8217;s AI. Know what I mean? It&#8217;s through all of that, I&#8217;m also, there&#8217;s time and the time is really our most valuable asset. What am I going to do with this time? So I took that time and added another skill. Cause I&#8217;m all, I&#8217;m really big on a unique skill set or a skill stack.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just like if someone were to come to me and say, &#8220;I want to do a short animated music video or film, and they need the music for it, and I need to have the poster created and they need to cut a trailer of it and have all these different aspects.&#8221; I could do all of that. That&#8217;s because I utilized that time to really put in those hours. I do hear you about the content creation. It&#8217;s almost like it cheapens the value of people who&#8217;ve spent the time to learn the craft and the skills. Right? Because I just post videos on TikTok and I&#8217;ll make money off of that, whatever. It&#8217;s like, what if TikTok goes away? That&#8217;s not really a transferable skill, just posting on TikTok. If you can design, if you can create an application, if you can do all of these different things, you&#8217;re going to be able to figure out your next move from that. That&#8217;s what I wanted to use the pandemic for was I have this time, let me add more skills that&#8217;s going to future-proof me moving forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. We&#8217;re using TikTok as an example here. I mean, I do think that there is a skill to that, but the problem that I see is that the skill is so closely tied to the platform that it&#8217;s hard, and I see this with some TikTok folks too. It&#8217;s hard for them to take success that they&#8217;ve made on one platform because the platform locks them into a specific way of maybe delivering content that doesn&#8217;t translate into a similar type of medium. For example, TikTok to Instagram or TikTok to YouTube, there are people that have millions of followers on TikTok and have 45 followers on YouTube because it just doesn&#8217;t translate. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s them not being able to transfer the skill to the platform because the skill is so tied to what the TikTok app allows you to do within its creation tools.</p>
<p>I remember this was back when I started my studio, my friend John, who had started a business together and he had found me through Meetup. They were like these web design meetups in the city, and he had just graduated from UGA, this white boy just graduated from UGA. We had met at a Panera Bread up in Buckhead, and I remember one of the first questions he asked me because he was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m looking to get into web design. Should I learn HTML or should I learn Dreamweaver?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, well, the language itself is probably better than learning the tool because the tool is just a tool that&#8217;s like saying, should I learn carpentry or should I learn how to use a hammer? It&#8217;s a difference in that.</p>
<p>I think sometimes with the tools like TikTok for example or things like that, you can get so locked in creation within that particular toolbox that you can&#8217;t transfer it over into something else. You can&#8217;t take the success that the platform or the algorithm or whatever TikTok gives you and transfer that into a magazine article, a blog, a long form video, a podcast, et cetera. The tools and the algorithm I think can sometimes lock creators into a box that is hard for them to get out of.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s why even a few years back, if you look at Desus and Mero, they were actually able to translate from Twitter to a podcast into a TV show. There&#8217;s plenty of other people who were funny online or on their YouTube channels who try to make the jump to TV or the radio and just bombed. It&#8217;s kind of the same concept.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It can be tough to make that leap, to make that jump, especially if you&#8217;re just not able to transfer the skill that you have outside of the confines of the platform that you were kind of initially on.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I noticed that you refer to yourself as a creator over referring to yourself as a designer. Is there a specific reason behind that?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I just like to create. Right? I wouldn&#8217;t say there&#8217;s a specific reason behind it, but I do a lot of things. If I make a motion graphic, for instance, I&#8217;ll go create my own music for it. That&#8217;s kind of, I guess where that comes from. I create meals, I&#8217;ll have friends over, I have family over, and I&#8217;ll be on the smoker for five hours and create an experience in that way. That&#8217;s why I kind of look at it as more of a creator than just strictly a designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Do you think it&#8217;s hard to, well, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s the best way to kind of frame this question, but I notice a lot of designers now are strict specialists. The work that they do is only within a specific type of design. They can only be a product designer or a UX designer or something like that. Not pick on product or UX folks, but they can only do what they do within that particular realm. I feel like designers like us, older designers, I think because we came up during this period where there was just so much opportunity because we were learning at the same time that the industry was learning and sort of discovering new things that we know how to do a lot of shit.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I was doing, &#8217;97, &#8217;98, I was making cash money websites on Geo City learning HTML.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I remember teaching myself HTML. I remember teaching myself Photoshop off of a cracked version of Photoshop, and then going to Barnes and Noble and looking at those $50 Photoshop tips and tricks books and just taking photos and bringing them home and using them on my cracked version of Photoshop to figure out how to make that sort of pixel and pin Diamante kind of cash money design or something like that. We know how to do a lot of things because the industry and just, I think the time period we were in allowed us the opportunity to do multiple things. It&#8217;s almost like now people want you to be more specialist.</p>
<p>Generalists and designers from our age group I would say we just know how to do a lot of stuff. You do audio editing, you do video, you do 3D, you&#8217;re a photographer. All of this is kind of wrapped up into what you do as a person and as a creator. I think sometimes in the industry, that can be hard for people to understand. &#8220;What do you do?&#8221; And you&#8217;re like, &#8220;I do a lot of stuff. What do you need?&#8221; You know?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Also too, from my perspective with starting the agency, if the agency continues on a good trajectory and it continues to grow, obviously I can&#8217;t do everything myself. Right? If I need to outsource, I want to know what to look for, and I want to be able to speak the language. If I&#8217;m talking to a photographer, I&#8217;m just going to be different from talking to a video editor than talking to a graphic designer. I want to be able to understand and explain and to lead and to coach and say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s try this instead of that, or let&#8217;s do this instead of that, or maybe we should use these file formats instead of these file formats.&#8221; That&#8217;s how I look at it having knowledge of all these different areas is because then in the future, when I&#8217;m working with my own team that I hope to build, I&#8217;ll be able to speak their language and to be able to break it down and to communicate with them on their same level, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, no, that makes sense. How would you say your creative style has evolved over the years?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
It&#8217;s kind of hard to say because even musically over the years, I&#8217;ve never really had a definitive style. If it moves me or if it feels good, I like it. But I feel like over the last three or four years that it&#8217;s definitely started to form into something more concrete. I just like clean design for one. Yeah, I just like clean, sophisticated, something that can draw emotion, especially with the 3D work, if it can take you into the world building those worlds and bringing the viewer into that. I would always say that the underlying aspect of all of that though, is really the storytelling. If you have the visual aspects of course, but the key parts for me is what&#8217;s the story that&#8217;s being told and does it evoke emotion? I think that&#8217;s what I focus on is more than what it looks like. Hopefully it always looks good and people like it and I like to experiment a lot, but my style I guess, would really be more of a storyteller just using all these different mediums to tell different stories.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you do a lot of self-initiated projects as you&#8217;ve mentioned. We can look on your website or your Instagram and see these little video vignettes and other things that you&#8217;ve done. Do you have a dream project that you would love to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Actually, I think I&#8217;m working on it right now. I can&#8217;t really discuss it right now, but yeah, I think I&#8217;m working on it right now actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. We&#8217;ll keep it vague so once it comes out it&#8217;ll be a big surprise, but no, that&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Yeah, I got to keep it vague because the NDAs and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, I feel like the work that I&#8217;ve done over the last three years has been definitely, like I said, I&#8217;ve been very intentional about the work that I create for myself to attract the kind of clients that I want to work with. So I think that since I&#8217;ve done that, I have actually, even The Future Is Black, that comes from me creating work that I want to do in the future. It&#8217;s all been very intentional and I think that now a lot of that stuff that those dream projects and the type of people that I want to work with and the type of projects I want to work on are showing up in my inbox.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What keeps you motivated and inspired these days?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
Not to sound dark, but death, to be honest with you. We&#8217;re not going to be here forever, so we got to use our time wisely. Last year I actually lost my dad, so that kind of just lit an extra fire under me that was already under me. As we get older and you start seeing people that you&#8217;ve grown up on, even to see something like Jamie Fox having a medical emergency or something, you&#8217;re like, dang, we really are the middle age now. Half our life is done. It&#8217;s like we have to really figure out our legacy and what we want to leave behind and that kind of motivates me to keep going and to keep getting better and just try to be the best, not just creator but human I can be in the time that I have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If you could go back and talk to your college age Reggie, if you could go back and talk to him, what advice would you give him about just being a creative?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
It&#8217;d probably be the same advice that I&#8217;ve given myself throughout the years anyway. It&#8217;s just keep going. It&#8217;s going to take time, and I&#8217;ve always knew it would take time. People always say it takes 10 years or whatever to be an overnight success, so I always knew whatever I wanted to do would take time and I would have to have the discipline and keep motivated to get to those goals, but also just be open to the possibilities and the opportunities that come your way. You might have a specific vision in your mind of how you want things to turn out or how you want things to be, and it might not turn out that way, and when it goes in a different direction, it might actually be better than what you thought it would be. You just have to be open and you just have to keep going and stay focused on what you want to do. For sure. You got to have a plan, you got to execute that plan, but don&#8217;t close yourself off to other opportunities that may open up even more doors for you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want that next chapter of your legacy to be?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
My goal right now, especially with the 3D, is to tell Black stories through a medium that is traditionally not Black.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out just more information about you, more information about your work? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
My website is reggieperryjr.com and then my Instagram is @nobodyfamous. That&#8217;s pretty much it. I don&#8217;t really mess with Twitter or anything else, but yeah, if you want to see some of my work, you want to connect, I guess the best place would be through my website, via email or my Instagram.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Reggie Perry, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. One, I think just thank you for just kind of detailing your creative journey. I had mentioned before so much of what you mentioned has been kind of neck and neck with things that I&#8217;ve experienced. I really kind of know exactly where you&#8217;re coming from with your thoughts on just content creation and just creation in general and using the skills that you have to put your mark on the world.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s important that people see that you can have a long career in design and creativity and whatever you want to call it, as long, like you said, you sort of put in the work, stick to the plan that you have, things will kind of work themselves out. Basically, from what I can see from your work, you definitely have put in the long hours, you&#8217;ve done the work, you&#8217;re continuing to do the work. I&#8217;m excited to see what you do next. I think certainly what you&#8217;re mentioning about telling Black stories like that through maybe kind of a non-traditional medium, I see that definitely in the future happening for you. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Perry Jr.:</b><br>
I appreciate you having me. Thank you very much.</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Hey, first, thank you for having me, Maurice. Really been digging the platform since I&#8217;ve been introduced to it. Once again, thank you for having me, man. My name is Chris Charles. I am a photographer, creative director, designer. I just try to bundle it all up into&#8230; As a creative designer or art director.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. How are things going so far? I know it&#8217;s just the start of the new year, but how are things going for you?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, so far so good. I was very intentional about taking some time off leading into the new year, so I can kind of rest a little bit, spend time with family. So, thankful I have been able to get that time in and spend time with the kids and the fam. But yeah, so far so good. It&#8217;s kind of taken me a day or so to still get into the flow again of work, and consistently checking emails and communicating again. But yeah, I&#8217;m ready to get it popping.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I told myself this year that I&#8217;m going to start turning my phone off one day of the week. So I&#8217;ll turn it off Saturday night, turn it back on Monday morning. And I tried that, actually, a few days ago, just so people know we&#8217;re recording this at the top of the year, but I did it over New Years. It was so peaceful. That Sunday was so extremely peaceful. Monday was super productive, and it was so peaceful that I didn&#8217;t remember to turn my phone on until Monday afternoon or evening. And I turned it on, and I mean the flood of notifications. People were like, &#8220;Are you all right? Is everything&#8230;&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m fine. I just turned my phone off for 36 hours.&#8221; It&#8217;s good, the world can wait.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
You are much better than me. So I have measures implemented to where my phone isn&#8217;t as invasive as I know people who have all the alerts on, the lock screen thing. And so what I&#8217;ve done is I turned off notifications on my lock screen, the one that kills the battery. I keep my phone on silent with the exception of a few key numbers; my mom, my partner, my daughter, people who they will need to get to me just in case something happens. Other than that&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know if I can just turn my phone off. I think for me, it&#8217;s easier to just have it readily available so people can reach me in the event that they have an emergency. But kudos to you, man. I don&#8217;t know how you did it, but you did it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s an experiment. I just tried it once. So we&#8217;ll see if it sticks.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I&#8217;d have to send a mass email or text message to everyone to let them know, hey, I&#8217;m out the loop. I&#8217;m not communicating for X amount of time, so don&#8217;t expect a response but in the event of emergency, call this other number. I have to have an emergency contact person in place just for that, but.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I might end up doing that too because certainly I turned my phone back on, and I guess the way that my phone is set up too, I can get text messages on my computer, I can get some notifications, but it just wasn&#8217;t on my phone. And so I still was able to do some things, I just couldn&#8217;t or didn&#8217;t respond back to people right away and stuff. But let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;m paying for that today. I&#8217;m having to do a lot of catch up today.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, a long day of responding to folks, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But that Sunday was so peaceful. I was like, I&#8217;m doing this again. I can&#8217;t stress how no pings or nothing. That whole Sunday, I cooked breakfast, I listened to some jazz, I was chill all Sunday. I&#8217;m like, I want that feeling every week. I&#8217;m going to try to see if I can stick to it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I think you can do it. I think you can do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at last year, what do you want to change bringing into this year? You mentioned taking some time for rest.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m part Jamaican so I don&#8217;t know any other thing than to work all the time. Running my business but also working another job across town, and I just left that job before the new year, just because it just didn&#8217;t make sense commuting that far several times a week. But yeah, I think for me, working smarter not harder for 2023. I think 2022&#8230; And most of my career, I spent a lot of it doing all of the heavy lifting. I&#8217;ve had assistants in the past who helped manage communications and emails and I&#8217;ve worked with tons of young artists who volunteer their time, and some I&#8217;ve actually mentored and was able to get them going with their businesses. But I think it&#8217;s time to build a team. And I think it&#8217;s time to start delegating versus me being the lead communicator, the lead invoice generator and the lead key artist on set and then the key editor. Time is so much more important to me, I&#8217;m realizing, especially now that I have a young baby, six months old.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow. Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you, thank you. His name is Cerulean Amir, and he&#8217;s amazing. But yeah, I think moving into 2023 I definitely want to facilitate me being more present, and the way these knees are set up, doing all the squatting and getting all the angles, I would rather be able to guide that process through other people who are under the umbrella of my business.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hear you.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the goal.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s talk more about your work in your studio, Chris Charles Co., which you&#8217;ve ran now for 15 years, so congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me a little bit more about it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So, ultimately, and this kind of plays into the vision for this year and moving forward. I&#8217;ve always kind of been a multidisciplinary artist, I mean with roots in obviously photography, design, music. I produce music as well. I&#8217;ve worked with a few artists and I&#8217;ve always felt that the three words that I&#8217;ve used to encompass my business are style, creativity and soul. And for me, that&#8217;s kind of the type of person when it comes to aesthetic that I always wanted to be. Even when I was a kid, I just wanted to be cool. And that being influenced by music and jazz and seeing how cool those people were.</p>
<p>I always wanted to have whatever business I ran encompass those kind of things. Just like a cool energy, a cool vibe, some fly music going on, some fly art, whatever it is. So yeah, I think my business, while I also focused on trying to strive to be technically proficient, but it was also about creating a vibe or a feeling to the point where whatever I put out in the universe via the internet, it&#8217;s a reflection of those three things, style, creativity and soul. So I&#8217;ve just kind of ran with it and it seems to have helped me find my voice over these years. So that&#8217;s pretty much&#8230; Be it design, photography, music, show-making, those are the things that I&#8217;ve really pushed to have come to the forefront.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So given all of that, what are the best types of clients for you to work with? I know you mentioned musicians, but are there other types of clients that you find you work best with?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Honestly, I work just other artists in general. DJs, musicians, visual artists. I&#8217;ve worked with other photographers doing portraits and collaborating with them, painters and also high-level business people. For some reason, it&#8217;s more like a, wow, this person is amazing. I could learn so much from them, and they hired me to do this work. You know what I mean? So it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s feeding my desire to learn more and have goals based off of what I&#8217;m seeing this person has done, and I&#8217;m actually doing what I love to do while learning. So yeah, I would say anyone in the arts, like I said, high-level business people. I&#8217;ve worked with district court judges, I&#8217;ve worked with mayors, mayoral candidates, city council people, attorneys, high-end real estate folks, and all of these people have great lessons that I can pull from to use at some point in my business. So this is great. I love that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So given that variety, how do you approach creating a new project or working on a new design project? Because I would imagine with each of those types of clients, the setup might be a little different, I&#8217;m guessing.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah. One thing I used to struggle with&#8230; Well, I won&#8217;t say I struggled with it, but one thing I had to really understand was find a way to maintain whatever vision or artistic integrity I had while still fulfilling my clients&#8217; needs. And sometimes those things don&#8217;t always align, and I&#8217;ve had to adapt and adjust in order to facilitate my client being happy and just doing the work. But yeah, I think for me, I just like to assume that people who have hired me, it&#8217;s not like sight unseen. They&#8217;ve seen examples of my work and they&#8217;ve seen&#8230; Or other people who I&#8217;ve worked with and they&#8217;re like, hey, I want that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve had some clients who have no&#8230; Whatever I do, whatever they want was the opposite. So that I think has been a big challenge over the years. But ultimately, it&#8217;s just about adapting and adjusting, interjecting those three things, style, creativity and soul while still keeping whatever format my client wants to maintain their brand and push their image forward. So it&#8217;s a lot of, I&#8217;d say, adjustment. I don&#8217;t want to say shape-shifting, but it&#8217;s more like a, yeah, I can do this, but I can still slide some of these elements that I always kind of hearken to for this person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like that&#8217;s a common thing with multidisciplinary folks. It&#8217;s like we know that we can do a lot of different things, and sometimes the client is aware of that and sometimes they just want the one thing that they want, but it is a lot of adjusting to try to make sure you&#8217;re fitting in with the scope of the project, their involvement in terms of how things are going. It is a lot of&#8230; It&#8217;s a constant adjustment, I find.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, it is. And I don&#8217;t know, I think by nature, just based off of my travels, even as a child I&#8217;ve always been very adaptable, but I&#8217;ve always tried to stick to a certain thing that, okay, well I&#8217;m going to do this but I&#8217;m going to do it this way. And it kind of made me a rebel. When I say that, I mean I&#8217;ll follow the rules but up to a certain point that I&#8217;m just going to just do it this other way because I think it&#8217;s more efficient. I kind of relate that to working with clients and just adapting. And yeah, I hear what you&#8217;re saying. I know you want the logo with the money, the dollar signs raining and all of that, but maybe we can simplify it a little bit. Here, let me show you this. So I found using examples of other brands within that person&#8217;s market helps kind of dial those things in for me too, so I don&#8217;t have to really have too much conflict.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you handle the business side of everything? Because the work definitely is the creative part. That&#8217;s what you specialize in. But, when it comes to marketing and contracts and finance, how do you balance that with the more creative aspects of your work?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It took me a while to actually find a rhythm with managing all the things outside of the art and creating, but eventually I was able to figure out a way to say, for example, automate my booking process so I don&#8217;t have to have these conversations and these email threads that just lead to dead ends. Usually if someone clicks and books, they&#8217;ve already made their mind that they want book me. So that saved me so much time. I&#8217;d also, say, having an assistant, I had a really great assistant and then she moved on to greater things. But I really learned to appreciate how&#8230; For one, she was really good at what she does, and she actually is based in Atlanta, so she was working virtually. But that type of communication, I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m a horrible communicator, but sometimes I&#8217;m too busy out working to communicate in a timely manner.</p>
<p>And having someone who that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re doing for me made it so much easier. But other than that, it&#8217;s just kind of trial and error. It&#8217;s like, hey, I&#8217;ve gone through so many phases with trying this invoicing system or trying this business bank account to see that works in payment gateways and figuring out the most seamless, easiest way for a customer to pay a deposit and then book it online without having to have conversation, after conversation, after conversation. So yeah, it&#8217;s been a journey. It&#8217;s definitely been a journey, but I&#8217;ve been able to figure it out just based off of trial and error and kind of doing what works, but also evolving, being open to evolve. There&#8217;s a few things I want to add into the mix this year. Definitely want to get someone to do the actual books and have an accountant, or someone who I can contract to have to do the accounting. Because I&#8217;m pretty much doing it all of that myself as well, so.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now outside of that, being in the arts and being self-employed, that&#8217;s a lot to balance, I think particularly with just the way that our attention economy kind of works. What are some of the biggest challenges that you&#8217;ve had to face staying independent and doing this for as long as you have?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Dealing with the economy. I think managing&#8230; Be sustainable, which is every business during economic downturns, and that&#8217;s another challenge. I&#8217;d say just dealing with the ebb and flow. My business is a cash flow-based business, and most businesses that, but fortunately I don&#8217;t have much overhead, so that makes it a lot easier. I&#8217;m not producing a physical product that requires me to buy inventory and surplus. So that in itself has really helped me manage the challenges of an economic downturn and keeping clients and being able to have clients who just keep coming back. And some of my best clients are those repeat clients. But ultimately also over-saturation. Over-saturation. When I started doing photography professionally, there were just maybe a handful of really, really great photographers in my area who I looked upon for inspiration, and I saw they had things established. They did great work.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now, it&#8217;s like you can just close your eyes and point your finger one direction, and you&#8217;re probably pointing at a photographer. You know what I mean? So staying relevant, being open to new ideas is kind of, like a lot of artists, I think specifically more with musicians and kind of trying to grow their art and their craft while still maintaining that voice that put them on in the first place. So for me, I don&#8217;t want to look at it as competition. However, it is somewhat of a competition. This is a free market. So if I want to be competitive in this market, I have to pay attention to what other people who are 20 years younger than me are doing. And if I have a client and suddenly I see my client shooting with this 20-something year old, I&#8217;m like, oh okay, great. Yay. But also, I&#8217;m like, huh, how&#8217;d that happen? What do I need to do to where I can keep this particular client or clients? So yeah, it&#8217;s a few challenges.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know when I was actively having clients and doing client work, one of the biggest challenges, aside from what you mentioned, is just making sure that they still keep you sort of top of mind with what they do. Because I think, like you said, there&#8217;s over-saturation sometimes in the market and there&#8217;s a number of different people that folks could choose from to do kind of the same work. And so I think it&#8217;s really important also to just have those relationships. The relationship building part is so important with so many other people out there, because the benefit I think that we have, you and I, and probably others of our age group, is being able to build those relationships as opposed to just putting out whatever the newest, hottest, latest, fastest tool or product is that can get the job done.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it&#8217;s about relationships. You mentioned one of the clients you&#8217;ve had has been a mayoral candidate. I did a mayoral race back in 2009. The person didn&#8217;t win, the candidate didn&#8217;t win, but she ended up working then for a nonprofit organization and I had that organization a retainer for five or six years. And then every place that she ended up going, I kind of followed her in some aspect in terms of like, oh yeah, I could do this work, I could do this work. Or just keeping top of mind so they know, oh, well I know someone who could use you. So then that relationship building really comes into play because your name gets mentioned in rooms and other places that you&#8217;re not necessarily available.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Exactly, exactly. And yeah, I think I&#8217;ve definitely been fortunate to have had several of those types of clients where I&#8217;m talking about 10, and you mentioned the foreign exchange. It&#8217;s almost like 10 years we&#8217;ve been working together. And then of course, with Nikolai individually and with Phonte individually, it&#8217;s been like I&#8217;ve been their go-to guy, and I appreciate that. I have some clients who, once again, are in the political scene and some musicians who, there&#8217;s no question they will call me, and I don&#8217;t take that for granted. But also it&#8217;s because we can sit down and kick it after we do a long shoot. We go grab some food, we have a couple of beers, and we kick it for a little while and just decompress and catch up. I value that.</p>
<p>Because to me, that&#8217;s connection. And for me, especially when it comes to doing portrait work and photographing people, it&#8217;s important that I established that rapport, which could potentially lead to a cool relationship and friendship. But I can&#8217;t get a good picture of someone if we&#8217;re doing a session, if we haven&#8217;t had a conversation that kind of face-to-face, and that way we can feel each other out. I can see where I need to go, how I need to handle this particular photo shoot. Yeah, I&#8217;ve been able to, like I said, make some really great, great friends because of that relationship aspect that you mentioned.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I just started back doing some client work through my studio now, and one thing I&#8217;ve been doing is going back through my old contact list of clients. And the first of the year, best time to do it, best time to restart a dormant relationship or a dormant former communication. Just hit them up, Happy New Year, how are things going? This is what I&#8217;m doing. Because people just kind of have that energy at the top of the year to want to do something new, try something new. So it&#8217;s a good time now to make those relationships happen or to try to at least begin to forge them.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Absolutely. Yeah. Just before Christmas, I sent out some tests, newsletters with some things just to see, once again, updating that client list and seeing do I need to remove or add some things and change and seeing the response and looking at the numbers. So yeah, you nailed it, man. Definitely going to be doing the same this year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to get more into your work and some of the clients that you work with. Of course, you mentioned foreign exchange, which we&#8217;ll talk about later, but I want to hear more about your origin story. I know you&#8217;re in North Carolina now. Is that where you&#8217;re from? Is that where you grew up?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
No, I actually grew up in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. ell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Spent my formative years in Brooklyn, but also going back and forth between Brooklyn and Jamaica. We usually go every summer, or every other summer. And Brooklyn is a melting pot of West Indian and Caribbean culture, anyway. So yeah, growing up in New York was such a great experience for me. I think I tell people I grew up, I think in during the best era to grow up, which was the late &#8217;70s going into the &#8217;80s. Because once again, I literally would&#8217;ve had a Irish neighbor across the street. Their neighbor was Italian, who was my first babysitter. We had a Puerto Rican family on the corner. We had the Haitian family right there. You had my family, which was a mixed ethnicity. You had people from Aruba, people from Barbados. It was such a melting pot of culture. So I was exposed to a lot of different languages and a lot of different foods and energies. And thankfully, my parents and I, we traveled.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d get on a plane and go somewhere, go to LA, go to Jamaica, and my dad had family in Pennsylvania, so we&#8217;d be in the mountains. Just being in that type of environment or those types of environments where I&#8217;m surrounded by so many different things, it influenced me and grew up in a very musical household and very artistic household. And I played guitar, took formal guitar lessons for years, and my household was the type of household that always had music playing, be it jazz or reggae music. So my parents loved to dance. We do the New Year&#8217;s Eve party at our Puerto Rican friends&#8217; home, and they&#8217;d be dancing salsa all night. So I just love music and culture. So, I couldn&#8217;t help but be influenced by all of that growing up during that time in New York. So went to high school, did that. Played football in high school, actually. So I wound up going to college initially at a Kentucky Wesley College with a partial scholarship to play football. And that was a disaster because that was my kind of first time away from home.</p>
<p>Being in Kentucky as a New York dude was kind of different for me. I made it through football camp, and I was like yeah, I&#8217;m not feeling this, and I went back home. So I had to regroup, and my parents were looking at me like, okay, so what are we going to do? You can&#8217;t just be laying around here. You know what I mean? You got to do something. So I said, okay. Always loved architecture, always loved art and clean lines and drafting. I took drafting in high school, so I pursued a degree in architectural engineering, the New York Institute of Technology in Farmingdale, it&#8217;s a [inaudible 00:24:32] entity, and that was great. But I also have a military family. All my uncles were in the military. My dad was a Marine, my brother was in the army, and that&#8217;s also something I always knew I wanted to do. I was a boy scout and I loved wearing a uniform. I was one weird kids who just loved putting on a uniform and being fresh. So yeah, I did college and then immediately joined the Army.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So this is, what, &#8217;93, &#8217;94. And wound up getting a job doing surveying, but it was for artillery. So I kind of got hoodwinked. I kind of got made switch with you have engineering background. Yeah, this could be a great job for you. But I&#8217;m sitting next to a [inaudible 00:25:18] blowing up stuff, you know what I mean? But ultimately, it was good. I had a good time, did a couple of overseas tours, and I made sergeant. And so now I had to manage a team, and that kind of taught me leadership and politics when it came to, not just the military, but corporate, I came to find out later.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s where corporate gets it from, so that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Structures, politics of it all. They parallel each other. So anyway, I decided maybe I want to change jobs. So in the military, they have what you can do as reclassifying. So I reclassified as a communication specialist, and more specifically a network switchboard engineer. So like an internet guy, basically. And that was great because it basically helped me transition out of the military eventually with those same skillset sets. And I was able to apply them. But meanwhile, I was also a paratrooper, so I was jumping out of airplanes and went to jump master school. So I was jump master qualified. I was aero [inaudible 00:26:16] qualified.</p>
<p>So I was propelling out of helicopter, jumping out of airplanes, doing all the cool stuff, even though I had these technical jobs, because that was kind of that guy who just wanted to do the hard stuff as much as possible while I still had the young legs. So yeah, eventually 2003, after my last deployment in Iraq&#8230; Well, 2004 is when I began&#8230; I came back, I think April, and put in my paperwork to get out the military because I just felt it was time. My daughter was very young at the time. She&#8217;s 21 now. But I just didn&#8217;t want to be away from her and missing her grow and potentially not being able to see her again, not making it back from the deployment is very real.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Especially right around that time in the early 2000s. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah. 2003, 2004, maybe going in 2005, &#8217;06 was a rough one because the warfare over there with the IEDs&#8230; And it was really bad at one point. And I was there for that when you never knew if you were going to get blown up in a convo at some point. And that hit me. That was real, that was real to me. I said I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m a smart guy, I think I&#8217;ll be able to figure something out, especially with the skillsets that I gained in the military. And that&#8217;s what I did. So I got out of the military in November, 2004, and haven&#8217;t looked back since. I transitioned almost immediately into a corporate IT job.</p>
<p>And that was great. I did that for about five years. And then 2009, the 2008, the bubble burst and the economy tanked, and I wound up getting laid off. So here I am, had a corporate job, great benefits, great pay, and now I got laid off. Never happened to me before. I didn&#8217;t know what that felt like. And it was horrible being called into the operation manager&#8217;s office with all of us who got laid off. It wasn&#8217;t just myself, walking back to your desk and you see all your stuff packed up in a box on the table with a security guy waiting to walk you out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It was embarrassing. You feel powerless, you just feel like, wow, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing? Wound up getting laid off. And I had to really, really sit on it for a minute. And then I realized that was a universe kind of pushing me in the direction of becoming an artist full-time. Now keep in mind, when I was working at this particular company, I became good friends with the art director there, and he knew I was kind of dabbling in photography, and he invited me to drive to Boston to shoot a wedding because I guess he&#8217;d seen some of the work I was doing just for free. And he thought I had an eye. So he took me, and that was the first paid gig I ever had as a photographer shooting that wedding. And that&#8217;s when also the light bulb clicked.</p>
<p>Was kind of already getting over the job, it was very stressful as far as just the IT and networking, dealing with clients, having to take the blame for other people&#8217;s mistakes or whatever. So when he says, hey man, I&#8217;m going to cut you a check for $1500, just drive to Boston in my Audi. I was like, oh shit. Okay, let&#8217;s go. Hey, maybe I can just keep doing this. And then a few months later, I wound up getting laid off. So it was all serendipitous how it happened, even though I wasn&#8217;t seeing that at the time. But it definitely helped guide me into the direction I kind of eventually went. So I took my GI bill and took a little bit of time off. Because I did get a bit of a pension, not a pension, but a severance day. So I was able to survive and pay my bills, but eventually enrolled back into college and wound up getting a degree in graphic design while slowly building my business and getting to know the community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So that was a very big transformative time for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And in hindsight, like you said, it worked out in the end. Something I want to just touch on, you mentioned though that time between, I would say roughly the mid 2000s, 2004 to 2008, 2009, that was such a&#8230; And I can&#8217;t stress this enough for designers that were not around during that time. That was such a wild time in terms of just design, I guess you could lump tech in with it, but particularly web design, graphic design. So many things were changing in that just five-year span that you were lucky if you could stay at the same place for that long because the technology was changing, the browsers were changing, the actual hardware itself was changing, the software was changing. There were so many changes that took place that it would be hard to keep up with everything that&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. And I don&#8217;t know, for me I think what helped me was being in school&#8230; And at the time I was still using Windows, for example, but we had iMac Labs where I was able to kind of&#8230; I was like, oh, this is nice. Okay, cool, cool, cool. But not only the technology, but I guess you said the design language, right? Like I said, I loved architecture, I loved clean lines. I loved a certain minimalist aesthetic. And I started noticing design shifting to that versus heavy drop shadow and beveled fonts. And a lot of overly-designed things that have, and I attribute that to Apple, actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I think Apple&#8217;s brand pretty much influenced the design world when it came to aesthetic and minimalism. Being able to be able to sell something and tell a story as cleanly as simply as possible and maybe using really great imagery overlay with text. So that whole look&#8230; Like when I started seeing that and I realized that that&#8217;s kind of how I love that, that&#8217;s what it was for me. So it made my transition fairly easy. Because I just wanted to stick to that aesthetic. It was just, like you said, learning the technology and learning in Design and Illustrator and all those things. I was pretty good in Photoshop already. But those other Adobe products, they were kicking my butt for a while. But I think I got a handle of them now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember the macro media stuff when it switched over to Adobe. I used Fireworks a lot in one of my old jobs. And then Fireworks pretty much became obsolete. Adobe bought Macromedia and changed a bunch of stuff over. And then I was a web designer at the time. There was the whole switch from table-based layouts to CSS-based layouts. Which then changed the browser because the browser then was less about just display and it became more of a canvas. It became more of somewhere you can create things just on there and not have to transpose. I remember cutting up tables in Dream Weaver and exporting them over and making sure everything was right. But now you could use CSS and you could float things and create divs&#8230;</p>
<p>And it was just such a big shift&#8230; It was a really seismic shift, I think, in design online during that time. And yeah, also the switch from the nineties style of design, especially with tables and things like that because they borrowed a lot from print, to more clean lines. Because it&#8217;s just based on what the browser did, because the browsers then had to catch up. This is after the whole browser wars of the late &#8217;90s and stuff. But browsers became less about, oh, this is just a place you can view a website. It&#8217;s like, no, this is a place where you can build a website. There&#8217;s technologies, there&#8217;s like a stack in the browser where you can make things. It was just such a&#8230; I look back at that time fondly, but also in hindsight, there was a lot going on.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t think&#8230; for me, I wasn&#8217;t aware of it at the time. I was just like, oh, okay. This is cool. Oh, this is&#8230; Okay, cool. This is cool. That&#8217;s cool. I even look at&#8230; I use Photoshop a lot, for example, and I look at Photoshop from back then to now and how much I can do that I really couldn&#8217;t do without having to download a plugin or something. And the same thing with everything in the Adobe Suite. I was using Premiere for a while and I just couldn&#8217;t, didn&#8217;t jive with me. So even now transitioning over to Da Vinci Resolve has been like, my head explodes every time I use it. So it&#8217;s so phenomenal. And it doesn&#8217;t bog down my CPU. I don&#8217;t have to open up a whole nother program to do as much. I can do it all in here. I can do audio the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
This is awesome. For 300 bucks, I don&#8217;t have to do a subscription, a yearly subscription. I [inaudible 00:34:48] with it. So I&#8217;m just really thankful for it. I love technology, so I&#8217;m thankful for technology. I&#8217;m kind of a computer nerd. I was as a kid, backtracking real quick, I used to write programs on the old&#8230; Gosh, it wasn&#8217;t an IBM computer. It was a Commodore.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, the Commodore 64?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. Definitely showing our age. Because that one [inaudible 00:35:12]. Yeah, I&#8217;d go to the library and rent and take out these coding books and you&#8217;d spend three hours writing code just to make the colors on the screen. And that was fascinating to me. Just learning syntax. And anyway, so it helped me, even in corporate. When I was working in corporate, I had to&#8230; The company I was working for, it was a proprietary voiceover IP network, one of the first in the country. So I would have to be able to trace a call from London to California, and I could literally look at the numbers on the screen and see the nodes as the signal is&#8230; Well, the communication is traveling and seeing where it breaks. And that always remind me of when I was a kid. Wow, this looks just like when I was programming my Commodore 64. But yeah, I&#8217;m just nerding out a little bit on the tech. But it&#8217;s a great timing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it was. Even visually with&#8230; Flash was just everywhere. Flash was such a huge component of creating experiences online. And now in 2023, really years prior to that, I&#8217;d say probably as early as maybe 2020 or so, Flash is just a distant memory.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
During that transitional phase when I was going to school, I actually gig doing graphic design and marketing for a local recording studio. And I had to do Flash. And I was like, what the hell is this? I&#8217;d never really had much experience with Flash and I thought it was kind of an antiquated technology, even back then. But they insisted on using it for their banner ads and whatever. But me being at that job was also a big turning point for me because of just where I was. And then being around musicians and kind of transitioning into connecting with artists who needed photography and design. You know what I mean? So yeah, that was a good time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s bring it back to your studio, then. So you had that spark to start your studio then after doing that photography gig, you&#8217;ve kept it going now for 15 years, and your client list is extremely impressive. Just some of a few, I&#8217;ll name off here. Moleskine, which are the notebooks, the Italian leather notebooks, Apple Music, Spike Lee. And of course, musicians, The Foreign Exchange. They&#8217;re one of my absolute favorite groups. I&#8217;ve been a fan since Connected. I&#8217;ve been such a fan. This is complete fanboy moment at this point. How did you get involved with them?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of a funny story. So back in late 2009, I was kind of slowly making a name for myself as a photographer. I&#8217;m a music nerd, and I was dating someone at the time, time who knew Phonte.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Actually, I think they dated years before she and I met. But anyway I was also on&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if you remember the Okayplayer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, I remember them.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I was on Okayplayer, and I go into the, what do they call it, the rooms or whatever, the chat rooms, I guess, and just nerd out on music. And at the time that&#8217;s pretty much how the product exchange met on Okayplayer. And they recorded their whole album by just sending tracks and vocals across the ocean, because Nicolay was in the Netherlands at the time, living there. So anyway, so it was cool being able to connect with these artists like Little Brother and Questlove, and kind of just being involved in conversations and casts happen about music. And the person I was dating at the time would randomly post my photography into the forums. Like hey, my boyfriend did this picture, blah, blah, blah. And apparently Phonte was paying attention. So one winter, like I said, I think late 2009, we went to a gig.</p>
<p>It was a Red Bull event, and it was a battle of the bands featuring The Foreign Exchange and a punk rock band. And it was brilliant because what they had to do was play each other&#8217;s music and interpreted however they saw fit based off of the genre. Right? So it was cool hearing The Foreign Exchange&#8217;s band, which was amazing, playing these compositions that the punk rock band made. And then vice versa, you know what I mean? Really good time. Of course, I brought my camera, took some really cool photos of the bands. And then as we were leaving, I hear someone calling me and it&#8217;s Phonte. He and I had never met, but he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey man, you Chris Charles? I saw you coming you up here. We got a new album coming out, man.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Word? Okay. Hit me up, man.&#8221; And that was it. That was the beginning of that relationship. I just loved the process. So I worked with almost all the artists under the, not just The Foreign Exchange, but their record label.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So Median when he was on the label, just finished working with, well last year, last summer. BeMyFiasco, who is Phonte&#8217;s prot√©g√©, musically. And yeah, pretty much have done every project after Leave It All Behind.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So did all the photography, the design. Think the first one was Love in Flying Colors. That was the one. And yeah, did all the pre-flight, the layout, the photography, excuse me, and then yeah, all the way up to their last one. So it&#8217;s been a great journey with those guys. And we just did a photo shoot a few months ago, actually. Because they have some things that they&#8217;re going to be doing here. So it was good reconnecting with those guys again. But yeah, it was just, once again, those types of circumstances that the relationship building aspect of it is what&#8217;s important. And we&#8217;ve always had a great relationship. Really great guys. So yeah, those guys are cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m trying to think how I first found out&#8230; I think I found out about Foreign Exchange either through&#8230; It was one or two ways. One, there&#8217;s a music store here in Atlanta called Moods Music.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, I know it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Darryl.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a hot spot, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s the spot. That&#8217;s the spot. I&#8217;m gatekeeping a little bit now that I&#8217;ve told the whole world on the podcast, but that&#8217;s the spot though. That&#8217;s the hot music spot in Atlanta. But I either found out about them. It was either through there or through this website that a couple of friends of mine founded called SoulBounce. I can&#8217;t remember if it was through one of the two. It was one of those two that I remember first hearing about it, because like I said, I&#8217;ve been listening. I&#8217;ve been a fan since Connected. Leave It All Behind, still gets rotation in this house to this day. &#8220;House of Cards,&#8221; oh my god, love that group. And even all the other stuff that Phonte did. I know Phonte and Zo! did this &#8217;80s cover album. That was really good.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It was Percy Miracle, and I forget the other name. But yeah, Phonte had the Jerry Curl wig on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, they did Stepping Out. They did Africa from Toto. Yeah. That was&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Those guys are so talented, man. Even now with&#8230; What&#8217;s that show? I know Zo! and Phonte been writing a lot for this new kind of musical skit comedy show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, is it Sherman&#8217;s Showcase?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Sherman&#8217;s Showcase, yes. And then of course, I designed the Eric Robeson Phonte record, Tigallerro. I did Phonte&#8217;s last single. Any visuals that came out pretty much revolving around the phone exchange or Nicolay&#8217;s or Phonte individual projects, I also had the privilege of working on. So, such a good time, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, man. I think of all that. You mentioned Eric Roberson and now I&#8217;m thinking of all the soul music that was also just kind of in and around during that time. That was such a&#8230; When I think on that time, that was late 2000s early 2010s. That was such, for me, that was just such a pivotal time. I think I was just turning 30 right around then, too. I was like, oh man. Such good music. And that&#8217;s so cool that you were just a part of all of that. And you get to work on it all. Do all that stuff.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It&#8217;s still surreal. It&#8217;s still surreal. Whenever I see&#8230; When President Obama had one of their songs on his yearly playlist, I&#8217;m like, what? I&#8217;m looking at a photograph and design I did and now President Obama saw that, word? I mean, that&#8217;s cool. It&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Can you give me a sneak peek on whether or not they have a new album coming out?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I&#8217;m sworn to secrecy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. All right.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s just say we did a&#8230;.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You mentioned a photo shoot, I thought I would ask.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m sorry, that&#8217;s all I can say. But yeah, stay tuned, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;re talking about Foreign Exchange and Phonte too, but Nicolay is super talented as producer. I have some of his solo albums, too. One of them&#8230; I forget what it&#8217;s called. Something with Shibuya in it, I&#8217;m not remembering&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, no. The City Lights. City Lights Volume II. Oh man. That&#8217;s one of my favorite, favorite just chill out albums. One of the songs on there is&#8230; I forget the&#8230; I have to go back and remember the name. Because I know the song when I hear it, I can&#8217;t necessarily think of the name of it, but it&#8217;s like some song. I don&#8217;t know. I call it my getting home from the club song. When you get home super late and the sun&#8217;s about to Rise, it&#8217;s like that kind of song.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I forget the name of it. But they&#8217;re all super talented. That whole clique is super talented</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
And super nice. Whenever I get to catch up with Nicolay. The guy&#8217;s really, really smart. He has a degree in musicology. He&#8217;s not just like self-taught. He&#8217;s really formally trained, but also humble and tall. The guy&#8217;s like seven feet tall. He&#8217;s like about six foot seven. He&#8217;s huge. But just the nicest guy. Same thing with City of Lights Volume too. Those guys are always gracious whenever we connect. What&#8217;s another one I did? Not the Shibuya one. I did the next one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Soweto.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yes. I did the graphics for that one as well, as well for [inaudible 00:45:08].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been lucky, man. I&#8217;ve been lucky.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you do to stay motivated and productive with your work?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Just constantly evolving, actually, as far as what I do. For me, sometimes it&#8217;s just if I&#8217;m editing photos, I run into a creative block with where to go with a certain edit. I&#8217;ll put it down and I&#8217;ll step away and indulge in another media, be it a short film or looking at some art books that I have. But I know for me, staying inspired revolved around kind of exploring the balance between what&#8217;s in my head and what I see that catches my eye out in the world. And also music. A lot of my photography and design, I feel it&#8217;s so connected to musical energy. And at least to me, I always like to think of a song whenever I present a certain edit or if I do a print.</p>
<p>So for me, sometimes I&#8217;ll be inspired by music, or if I&#8217;m producing music and coming up with a theme and a rhythm, and I&#8217;ll start to see colors and I&#8217;ll start to say, oh, okay, maybe I think that&#8217;s rare. Then I go back to the edit and it&#8217;s like yeah, I add that touch of red to it. So, it varies. But mostly I&#8217;d say music and using contrasting mediums to kind of offset each other. So if I&#8217;m doing design, I&#8217;ll stop and do some photography or look at photography. If I&#8217;m doing photography, I&#8217;ll listen to music. It&#8217;s weird. I kind of traverse these different medium when I need inspiration from something else, from another place. So yeah, that&#8217;s one of the ways I use medium.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say your artistic style has evolved over the years?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
When I first started doing photography, especially when I was in design school, I was implementing design elements within my photography a lot. And it was just how I saw things. I would do a portrait and find a creative way to add text to it or add texture to it using overlays. I think as I&#8217;ve evolved as an artist, I think my style has&#8230; It&#8217;s gotten a lot simpler. So I&#8217;ve simplified it. I&#8217;ve been able to deconstruct it in a way that there might be some texture, or I&#8217;ll just use a textured backdrop or a textured setting, versus actually adding the texture in post.</p>
<p>But also just kind of continuing to try to master fighting in the technical aspects of photography. And then getting into filmmaking and learning that technology and learning how to edit and just being a one-stop shop. Because I just love all those mediums, so why not learn how to do them? And then eventually that became another aspect of my business. So I think expanding, going from this photography, to design and photography, to dabbling in web design. And then, oh, short films, and then doing promo spots for clients and doing commercials for schools and things of that nature. So yeah, learning new technology is pretty much how I think I&#8217;ll be evolved over the years, specifically</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Overall, is there a piece of art or a specific project or something that you&#8217;ve done that you&#8217;re particularly proud of? Like the crown jewel in your portfolio, or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
There are a couple, actually. I think most recently I got commissioned by a really amazing local candle making company, Black-owned, to design a signature candle to be distributed through the NBA, the NBA 75th Anniversary candle series. And they gave me full autonomy to design it within the specs of the candle. And with that, I was given access to seeing what the candle kind of smelled like, and taking hints from the notes of the candle and then implementing that into the design. That to me was very exciting, very exciting. And for that to be connected to the NBA was just mind-blowing. I&#8217;d say another one is probably the Spike Lee project that between&#8230; It was joint project between Spike Lee and Moleskine where they were doing these cheap, got-to-have-it books, Moleskine books. So that&#8217;s where that connection happened.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh!</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I was able to connect with Spike Lee and his team and come up with a&#8230; I had to shoot a short film of a local artist, a Black woman artist who embodied the whole image, the vibe of Nola Darling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nola Darling, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
It was cool because Spike Lee, huge inspiration for me. One of my favorite movies is near all of them, but I say from an aesthetic standpoint, [inaudible 00:49:37] blues, the way he used colors and contrasting colors to point out personality differences, and music and jazz. I think another fun time was shooting Martin Lawrence and his daughters&#8217; graduation party. And that was interesting and totally random. One of actually, it so happened that his daughter, her hairdresser was my client. They needed a photographer. And she graduated from Duke University. And I&#8217;ll never forget this, this was Mother&#8217;s Day a few years ago. And I remember going to brunch with my mom and then having to leave and drive to Duke University to their private banquet thing, golf club. And I&#8217;m looking at Martin Lawrence and his family. Oh, and Emmett Smith. Because they&#8217;re all connected. Emmett Smith, who&#8217;s one of my favorite running backs of all times for the NFL is Martin&#8217;s ex-wife&#8217;s new husband.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m looking at Martin Lawrence and his family, the kids, Emmett Smith, and I&#8217;m just there to take pictures and you&#8217;re paying me to do this. Are you kidding me? It&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s living the dream. So yeah, I&#8217;ve had some really amazing&#8230; Gosh, I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s times like these, and I&#8217;m thankful for you to these great questions because it really makes me think about&#8230; For one, if there was any time where I didn&#8217;t, or if any people didn&#8217;t respect the craft of image-making, be it photography or design, and the times that I&#8217;ve doubted it as well. Like oh yeah, people don&#8217;t take this stuff seriously. But then one day I&#8217;m in Venice Italy, because I was commissioned to be there by a client. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s like, wow, I said that but I&#8217;m actually overseas right now, and my whole job is to just be cool and take fly pictures. So yeah, I&#8217;ve had a few instances of really amazing experiences and being in rooms and work and opportunities. So yeah, I have a few, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying, I just can&#8217;t pick one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think once again, all of that really speaks to the power of relationships.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It really speaks to being able to know who, not just know who certain people are, but to maintain those relationships enough where people are advocates or sponsors for you in places where you&#8217;re not available. Especially with what you just mentioned with shooting Martin Lawrence&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s graduation, like you said her hairdresser is one of your clients, and so that&#8217;s how that all happened. They could have picked any photographer. Martin&#8217;s a celebrity. They could have picked any photographer.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
What&#8217;s so funny about that, she just called me randomly and she was like, &#8220;Hey, I got a gig for you. Just say yes.&#8221; I was like, what? She wouldn&#8217;t tell me who it was until the day before. She was like, oh, by the way, this is the Lawrence family and Smith family. Like, &#8220;Lawrence who?&#8221; [inaudible 00:52:29] I was like, oh, okay. Yeah. Relationships, knowing people and doing good work in this treating well manner.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And the Spike Lee Moleskine, I have the Spike Lee Moleskine. It&#8217;s still in the plastic. I refuse to open it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Oh, nice. Yeah, that&#8217;s definitely a collectors&#8217; item. Definitely a collectors&#8217; item.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve had a few people on the show that have done work with Spike, either presently or in the past and stuff. It&#8217;s amazing how he pulls in other Black designers to work on his projects, whether it&#8217;s like Art Sims doing projects, whether it&#8217;s you on this notebook project. I think most recently he did some work with this black typographer I had on the show, Tre Seals for his book, like design the font for the book and everything. Spike is really good about pulling in other Black creatives into his work, which I really appreciate that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
And I honestly believe, I think it should be like that. It&#8217;s always great to see and I always appreciate it. But how else are we going to continue to spread and learn about each other&#8217;s talents without actually giving each other shots and [inaudible 00:53:34] opportunities?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
I love to see it. Love to see it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice do you have for aspiring creative directors or artists out there, particularly those that want to be self-employed like you are and be able to kind of forge their own path?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;d say do your homework. And when I say that it&#8217;s great to go out with passion and present it, but you have to have a plan. And that could be, do you want to be a generalist? This could be applied to a couple of different mediums, of course. But yeah, do I want to be a specialist? Do I want to be a generalist? I&#8217;ve gone back and forth between that as well. For me, it&#8217;s about also diversifying, right? I don&#8217;t just solely rely on photography or I don&#8217;t just solely rely on consulting or design, or filmmaking. It&#8217;s about building a brand based on those three words. Like I said, style, creativity, and soul. And thinking about how you want your clients to feel when they work with you and after they&#8217;re done working with you, and will that make them want to work with you again? So it&#8217;s like a lot of soft skill stuff. I mean, of course, being technically skilled and talented, those are all great things, but if people don&#8217;t like you, you&#8217;re not going to go very far.</p>
<p>So I think learning how to maintain or establish and maintain relationships with people who align with the vision that you want to sell your artwork to, present your work to, and being able to manage that and navigate that and be in spaces and present yourself well, I think that&#8217;s really important. And then also, of course, the more technical stuff about managing business, establishing an LLC, your contracts, delivering, over-delivering at times, under-promising versus the vice versa. Because people will call you out. You said we were going to get 30 pictures, you only delivered 29. It&#8217;s like, oh, okay. Gotcha. But if I say I&#8217;m delivering 15 and I deliver 30, guess what? Now I&#8217;m a rockstar. And a lot of creatives take that for granted. And I also understand that there&#8217;s time and money involved with creating and running a business. So be mindful of that. Don&#8217;t kill yourself. Rest. Take your time to step away from it and reevaluate, reassess, learn, and then ask for mentorship from people who are already doing it that are in the game.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing, like future stuff or continuation of what you&#8217;re currently on? Where do you see yourself?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Yeah, ultimately five years&#8230; It&#8217;s funny because I&#8217;ve been actually writing out my tenure plan. And in the next five years, couple things. I definitely want to have a new physical space to run a shop and have a team, a dedicated team on payroll to where I can manage and be lead creative or a principal for projects that are being done by people that are working for me. But also, I have a really big passion for veterans&#8217; affairs. So I&#8217;ve been researching ways that I can somehow participate in helping veterans, be it they&#8217;re transitioning or trying to find their way out in the workforce. Or if they&#8217;re trying to start a business, there are so many benefits out there available to veterans who they don&#8217;t know they&#8217;re there and they&#8217;re just out here flapping and trying to work, but also might have some disabilities or issues that their workplace or workplaces are required to accommodate. So yeah, that&#8217;s a huge passion of mine honestly, in helping veterans, especially veterans of color, transition and live good lives after having lived through some really potentially horrible situations because of war. But yeah, having a shop and helping veterans.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Sure. So my main website is chrischarles.co. That&#8217;s chrischarles.co, not dot-com. The person who owns that domain name refuses to give it up, so I&#8217;m stuck with the dot-co and that&#8217;s no problem. That&#8217;s fine. So that has pretty much leads you to all of the other work that I do. I have a separate photography website, which you can also find once you go to chrischarles.co. But for people who are specifically interested in photography, it&#8217;s my full name, christophercharlesphotography.com. I have a Facebook business page, it&#8217;s Chris Charles Photo. My Instagram handle is the_chrischarles, so the, underscore symbol, Chris Charles. Those are the main places to find me. I&#8217;m there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Sounds good. Well Chris Charles, I want to thank you so much for coming on this show. I think certainly everything that you have talked about speaks to two key things that I think folks should kind of take in mind, particularly as we go into the new year. One is about being adaptable, and the second is about building relationships. I think everything that you&#8217;ve described about your career to date has been a testament to both of those abilities, and you&#8217;ve been able to craft and use both of those to be able to build a career for yourself, build a life for yourself, and continue to do great work out there in the community. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Charles:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me, man. This is really fun. Enjoyed talking with you, Maurice. And yeah, anything you need from me, just let me know.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of drive and determination to chart your own course, and no one embodies those qualities better than this week&#8217;s guest. As the creative director (and founder) of <a href="https://curvetheory.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Curve Theory</a>, Reggie Tidwell has provided beautiful and effective design, branding, photography, and videography work to clients for over 20 years. </p>
<p>We talked about the secret to Reggie&#8217;s longevity as a creative entrepreneur, and he shared his story about growing up in St. Louis, studying graphic design, and his early post-grad career as a Flash designer in the beginning days of the World Wide Web. Reggie also spoke about what brought him to North Carolina, and about his work in bringing an AIGA chapter to Asheville.

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Hey, I&#8217;m Reggie Tidwell and I am a graphic designer and a professional photographer as well as a videographer, which I do on occasion as well. I tell stories.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Wow, it has been a great year. Bought a house.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Thank you. I also have had my best financial career last year. Everything has culminated to that, and this year seems to be on track to even beat that, so that&#8217;s super exciting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, that&#8217;s real good. That&#8217;s real good. I mean, even with all of that, is there anything in particular that you want to try to accomplish before the year ends?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, once you own a house, there&#8217;s always house stuff that you want to accomplish, but professionally, man, things have just been falling into place and sort of a beautiful way that I feel just very excited. I&#8217;m going to be doing all of the photography for&#8230; So I&#8217;m a huge fan of the outdoors and nature landscape photography. I do a lot of that for Explore Asheville, which is our big tourism division here in Asheville, and the Gray Smoking Mountain Association has reached out and they&#8217;re going to have me do all the photography for their new book on Cade&#8217;s Cove, which is a really beautiful spot in the Smokies. So if you&#8217;ve ever been to Great Smokey Mountain National Park, it&#8217;s our biggest and most visited national park in the country and it&#8217;s absolutely gorgeous. But I&#8217;m super excited. I&#8217;m going to be doing all the photos for the book, so I&#8217;ll get a book cred.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. Congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about your company Curve Theory. Now, Curve Theory has been around for over 20 years, which I definitely have to tip my hat to you. I ran a studio for nine years and I know how much goes into that. So 20, over 20 years, I think. What, 21 now, right?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
21 years. 21. I&#8217;m in my 21st year. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What&#8217;s been the key to your longevity?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Quite honestly, it&#8217;s building relationships. I&#8217;ve never advertised. It really is a combination of building relationships and being passionate about the work that I do. I love designing photography, I love being a creative, I love people. And so it just makes sense that I would be able to maintain this business because it&#8217;s all the things that I love and things that I would be doing anyway. I&#8217;m always building relationships. I always tell people, and I always think it&#8217;s a funny little bit of a factoid about me. I don&#8217;t typically just add people on Facebook that I don&#8217;t know, and I&#8217;ve got 3000 plus connections on Facebook and every single one of them is someone that I know. I had either a meaningful conversation with and align somewhere, or they&#8217;re friends in real life or I served on the board with them, or whatever the case may be. They&#8217;re all real connections and when you think about that, that&#8217;s a lot of&#8230; Exponentially the more people, the sort of more you can grow your network. This business for me is really about being present and available.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s really good for Facebook. I think Facebook and probably a lot of social media networks now have really enabled this way to just collect friends, almost like you&#8217;re, I don&#8217;t know, collecting trading cards or something like that without really having any intentionality behind it. The way that you&#8217;re about connections on Facebook. That&#8217;s how I am on LinkedIn. I&#8217;m really, unless I&#8217;ve worked with you or I know you personally or something like that, we met at a conference or something, we&#8217;ve had a conversation. That&#8217;s usually the only way that I&#8217;ll add people. Although now, lately I have gotten a little lax and well, partly because I let them stack up. So I&#8217;ll go months without adding anyone on LinkedIn and all of a sudden I&#8217;ve got a hundred connections. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, I should probably go through these and see who I know.&#8221; And I tell people, write a note to let me know how we know each other. And I mean some of them are just sales calls and what have you, but&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So many of those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But in terms of the power of the network, I got laid off recently and I posted I think two posts on LinkedIn about it and I was flabbergasted by how my network showed up and spread the word and put me in connection with other people. And I&#8217;ve had some great conversations and such, so&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
That&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s this author Porter Gale who says your network is your net worth. I totally believe that. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Totally. Yeah. I get so much business from those connections on Facebook. I mean, quite honestly, it&#8217;s just doing stuff, especially from the photography side of my business. I&#8217;ll post a photo and I&#8217;m constantly posting photos and I do also on LinkedIn. Ultimately what ends up happening is because you&#8217;re constantly putting content out when someone thinks a photography and someone says, &#8220;Hey, do you know a great photographer?&#8221; You should be in someone&#8217;s very short list of their mental Rolodex. And that&#8217;s what happened. I get calls all the time. Hey, so and so&#8230; I mentioned on Facebook that I was looking for a drone photographer or a lifestyle photographer, a commercial photographer, whatever, and they mention you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What&#8217;s a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So for me, it&#8217;s nice being a designer and a photographer because on any given day, I never know it could bring me being out in a field on a photo shoot, it could bring me in a brand strategy session with a client, or a discovery session with a new branding client, whatever it is. It&#8217;s nice because my days aren&#8217;t always the same. I get to travel, I get to, for instance tomorrow I&#8217;m going to be in another area of North Carolina for a commercial shoot for pretty much much of the day, starting at Golden Color. And it&#8217;s nice. And then Friday I&#8217;m in the studio all day, probably editing photos from that shoot and rounding out a logo for another client.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you include your photography as part of your design service, so I guess company services, I should say?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Kind of. Occasionally the two will intertwine, usually the two intertwine when I&#8217;m doing web designing. So if I&#8217;m designing a website for a client, a lot of times because I know exactly what kind of images the client needs, I can add it as part of my service to do a lifestyle shoot of their company or their clientele, and then that can get baked into their website. And I&#8217;m working with my own images. I can control a lot more effort that way. But yeah, it happens. It doesn&#8217;t happen as much because I don&#8217;t do as much web design as I used to. I&#8217;m probably doing about two or three sites a year where I used to do quite a bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Back when I had my studio, I wound things down from the design end, I&#8217;d say roughly around in the mid 2010s because there was certainly a market for bespoke web design. They want, people wanted a particular website theme or something like that. But now with all these website builders out here, people are taking the design element, or at least the modular parts or the design process into their own hands. And it&#8217;s like, yeah, I don&#8217;t really need bespoke anymore. And so I ended up doing more consulting because you were able to shift like that. So it&#8217;s interesting now because I&#8217;m looking for work at the moment and people are like, &#8220;Oh, okay, you redesign a website?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, Ah. I mean I haven&#8217;t done it in a long time maybe.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I&#8217;m probably not your first choice for that, but I get what you mean. People, they hear design and of course if you have an online presence and a website, that&#8217;s the first thing they think about is, &#8220;Oh, can you design a website or can you redesign a website?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
I think depending on the client, I do still see value in bespoke. I feel like ultimately I&#8217;ll end up doing a completely custom website where I&#8217;ll get to work with a developer and I&#8217;ll design the front end and we can work beautifully and make something really amazing. But that doesn&#8217;t happen as often as I would like. But I do find the builders have actually worked for me because especially if you know them, there&#8217;s Divi and Elementor, there&#8217;s a handful of other ones I&#8217;ve been using Divi for a while, and though it can be a little bit verbose in it&#8217;s code, I find that the flexibility of me being able to do something completely custom using mostly you doing custom CSS to some of their built in modules.<br>
So I can build the content and lay out the content really quickly, then go in with CSS and really start to fine tune and make it exactly what I want it to be. That&#8217;s a nice, because I do work with very large clients and also small clients, that&#8217;s a really nice option for clients that don&#8217;t have six to 10 grand in their pocket to do a website. It&#8217;s just nice to have that as an option and for them to still get something that&#8217;s custom.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of which, what are the best types of clients for you to work with?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Quite honestly, I&#8217;ve got a soft spot for the mom and pop shops, either they&#8217;re startups or they&#8217;ve been around for a while and it&#8217;s time to change things up. I love that transition of being able to help them renew their own passion in their business through that process. I&#8217;m working on the branding right now for an auction house that&#8217;s been around for decades. They&#8217;ve been on Antique Roadshow, so they&#8217;ve got a presence, but their brand look is a bit dated and they&#8217;ve started resting on their laurels a little bit because everything is just so tried and true. It is what it is. It&#8217;s been what it&#8217;s been. And they realize this time to shake things up a little bit. They want to expand their market a little bit, they want to&#8230; And so going through that process with them, it&#8217;s so rewarding because they&#8217;ve been living with the same logo for 20 years, or longer.<br>
And to be able to see them embrace something that&#8217;s different, and it&#8217;s a fun process too with this particular client because they were like, &#8220;Yeah, we want some completely modern and avant garde.&#8221; And I went there, they were like, &#8220;Oh no. We love it, but we&#8217;re not ready yet.&#8221; And so, okay, that&#8217;s good. At least I know what your comfort level is. And so now I can dial it back and land exactly where we need to be. And then feeling them working through the resistance but then initially, not only acceptance, but oh my God, this is amazing. This is going to be really great for our company. We&#8217;re excited. That&#8217;s a great feeling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So when a project, let&#8217;s say, comes in your inbox or something like that, what does your process look like when it comes to starting on new work?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So I usually have a quick little meeting with the client just qualify whether or not we&#8217;re going to work well together and whether I&#8217;m the guy for the job. But then once that decision is made, I set up a discovery session where we really actually start to dig deep into the typical discovery questionnaire where you learn a little bit more about their business, their aspirations, what&#8217;s working, what&#8217;s not working, so I can better provide exactly what they&#8217;re looking for. I feel like, for me anyway, I feel like the key to being a good designer that makes happy clients and solves the right problems or solves problems in the right way is asking the right questions at the very beginning. So I&#8217;m all about being inquisitive. I want to know everything. And if you feel like it&#8217;s too much, it&#8217;s not.<br>
Because at the end of the day when I&#8217;m digging into sketching out logo concepts or I&#8217;m coming up with a tagline or whatever that information that I&#8217;m going to be so thankful that I have it because I can go through and dig in for inspiration to recheck the direction that I&#8217;m going to make sure I&#8217;m headed in the right way. But yeah, it&#8217;s all about the Q and A, at the beginning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I see here on your website that you do a lot of volunteer work. You worked also with Leaf Community Arts. Can you talk to me a little bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. So, Leaf Community Arts for me was a big part of, I did service work before that, but it probably to date was probably one of the biggest chapters in my life in terms of giving back. Leaf Community Arts is a nonprofit here in the Asheville area that they have teaching artists that go into the public school system and the neighborhood centers and basically recreation centers and they work with youth, teaching them poetry, dance, how to play the Djembe, how to do different types of art, visual art. It&#8217;s pretty amazing. And it gives kids this sense of ownership of something which I think is quite necessary, especially for the age range of students that they work with. But then they also have this other part that I was actually more aligned with was they do cultural preservation in First Nations, third world countries like [inaudible 00:16:38], and Uganda, and Rwanda, and Cuba, all these different places where there are cultures that have been around for ages and First Nations tribes that as the youth are becoming more westernized and the elders are dying off, these cultures are just vanishing.<br>
There&#8217;s no evidence of their songs, or instrument making, or costumes, or any of it. And so what Leaf Community Arts did what they were partnering with an agency on the ground that was trying to do that cultural preservation and help raise money to do things like build recording studios, or hire artisans that know the native language to native songs, the instrument making, the dances. And they actually make it really cool for the youth where they&#8217;re putting their phones down, and totally engaging, and dancing, and singing. And I found that particularly interesting. I love the beauty of cultures, and how different cultures are, and how you can learn something completely and different from a culture that you never had experienced before.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now are you still doing work with them? I know that now you&#8217;re also the new president of AIGA Asheville, the founding president, but have you waned your work with Leaf Community Arts?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
I have still a supporter of it. I worked all the way up to my presidency in 2017 and then my term ended. So I&#8217;m now board president emeritus. I&#8217;m still, the Leaf Community Arts people are family, they actually put on a huge music festival three times a year. I&#8217;ve met Arrested Development, Speech. Now we know each other by name. I&#8217;ve met, gosh, we&#8217;ve had Angelique Kidjo, and Mavis Staples, and Indigo Girls, and all these amazing bands that have come played. The Family Stone. But they put on this music festival in the spring and in the fall and this really beautiful place out in Black Mountain called, Black Mountain, North Carolina, called Lake Eden. And then they do one in downtown Asheville in the summer. And that basically raises money for all of the work that I mentioned before that they do with cultures and with the youth.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. Nice. And we&#8217;ll talk more about your AIGA Asheville work a little bit later on in the interview. With everything that you do through Curve Theory, what gets you truly excited about your work?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Man, I love to solve problems. Quite honestly. I love working with clients and trying to find out exactly what&#8217;s not working with them and helping come up with solutions that one, inspire and excite them. But then also they continue to propel me forward in my love of the work that I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now let&#8217;s dive a little bit into your personal story. You talk about this I think a bit on your website, but you grew up in St. Louis. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Born and raised?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So I grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. I was raised mostly by my grandmother, an amazing dad too, that was also in the picture. But most of my time was spent with my grandmother, who was an educator. She taught for 36 years and she was a huge supporter of education. And so in the summers where all my friends were out playing and running around, I had to do homework before I could go out and join them.<br>
And of course I hated it then, but on some level I understood the importance of it and it would come into play in many periods throughout my life, just being someone that is studious. I ended up testing the highest in the seventh grade in language and math in the entire school that I was in seventh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
In seventh grade. Which that said a lot about my grandmother&#8217;s dedication and how she worked it with me, but it wasn&#8217;t with a heavy hand. She just understood that she wanted me&#8230; I grew up in a very, I would say mean, just put it bluntly. It was a poor neighborhood, lot of gang violence, a lot of break-ins and theft. And I saw some pretty horrific things in my own neighborhood, just in my own alley. It wasn&#8217;t a place that I wanted to definitely grow up and grow old.<br>
And so education for me was the key of being able to get to a more ideal situation. So I wouldn&#8217;t say I was a first generation college student. My mother had a degree music, actually two. She had wanted music and art, possibly three maybe in education. But my grandmother, of course was educated. And so it set me on my path to discover who I really wanted to be in the world. I think you had mentioned very briefly what was it that made me choose this path of design? But all that didn&#8217;t come quite easily.<br>
I ended up pretty much blowing away my first couple years in St. Louis at a junior college called Florissant Valley. I think I had a 1.9 GPA because I wasn&#8217;t inspired. I picked business administration because I knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur. But you&#8217;re asking a 18 year old, 17 year old, 18 year old kid to decide what they want to do for the rest of their life. And yeah, of course I want to run a business. Oh yeah, business administration, that&#8217;s what you should do. But that&#8217;s such a broad topic. I wasn&#8217;t inspired.<br>
I actually went from that student, at one point I was the student in the back of the class nodding off, not very inspired. The teacher would call on me and not only did I not know the answer to the question, I wouldn&#8217;t even know what the question was because I was probably asleep. So I ended up taking a break after four semesters of that, I said I got to do better. This isn&#8217;t going the way I wanted to go. So I ended up taking a semester off and really doing some deep diving and soul searching. I talked to my counselor at the school. I really thought long and heavy about what I liked and the things that I knew I liked were being creative. I was always drawing from the time I could hold a pencil, I was sketching and doodling. And so I always loved art. My mom was an artist, is an artist. And so that was an inspiration.<br>
And so I went back to school. I decided at the time that I wanted to be an interior designer or a architect. And the path to both of those were mechanical drawing and a lot of drafting. And so that was all I needed to be inspired. I went from that student that I mentioned before to the student making the top score on every test in every class until I graduated. I went from a 1.9 GPA to a 3.2 GPA, graduated with honors and got my general transfer studies to go on to a four year college.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know there&#8217;s that saying that goes, sometimes you have to do things that you don&#8217;t necessarily want to do to try to get to do the things that you do want to do. But I think also to that end, just from what you&#8217;re mentioning, that whole period of high school going into college, there&#8217;s so much pressure to try to decide exactly what it is you&#8217;re going to do. And I mean we also, I think have to put this in the context of just where the world was at this time. Because I&#8217;m guessing this is around early nineties. Early nineties.<br>
And there was just this push, and I was mean I was in elementary school then, but I mean still there was this push to know exactly what it is that you&#8217;re going to do with your life at fairly early age. Look at the state of the world with what&#8217;s going on, what is it that you want to do? And for a lot of people it&#8217;s tough. I mean, even when I started out in college, I ended up switching majors because I thought I wanted to do one thing just based on societal norms and such. And then I was like, eh, I don&#8217;t really like it.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
I know. That&#8217;s a big part of it. I mean, thinking about it nowadays students take what they call a gap year. I am a firm supporter of that because I do feel like somebody that young needs to go out into the world a little bit and understand who they are. I mean, up to that point, they&#8217;ve just been a student studying all the basic electives. There&#8217;s nothing in that that would potentially produce career inspirations. Maybe you like math and maybe you like biology, but that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you want to be a mathematician, or a scientist, or a biologist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So yeah, I feel like that would&#8217;ve served me well. But thankfully I was able to make that comeback and find that inspiration.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You ended up going to Maryville, University of St. Louis and there you studied graphic design. Talk to me about that time.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So yeah, actually Maurice, I started, remember I said I was interested in just interior design or architecture. That&#8217;s what got me to Maryville because they actually had a nice interior design program. And I got there in those first two years I thrived. I was still inspired and I was still being a great student and loving the experience. But at one point I got, so the way Maryville&#8217;s program was set up at the time was you did all your art electives and got all those out of the way, and your art electives as well. You got those out of the way the first two years and then you dove into your concentration.<br>
Right as I was about to make that transition, I talked to my counselor, Nancy Rice, at the time and I was like, I don&#8217;t know if I want to do interior design. I like the sketching part, I like the conceptualizing, but then it&#8217;s all floor plans and elevations and it gets super technical and that&#8217;s the part that&#8217;s where I get lost. And this particular teacher who, it is funny because I&#8217;ll tell you this in a second. She basically told me, Reggie, you&#8217;re great at computers. You love computers. I&#8217;ve been working on computers since I was 15. My grandmother bought me a Commodore 64 and I was programming in basic, I was playing games. I became very comfortable in that computer world. The nerd, the invention of the nerd. I took that as a compliment. She&#8217;s like, yeah, you&#8217;re big in the computers. And then she said, and you also love art, so you should consider graphic design.<br>
And for me that was a new term. I hadn&#8217;t thought about it. And once I did the exploration and thought about it and understood what graphic design was and understood that I&#8217;d already seen it all around me all the time already and thought about how I could be someone contributing to that. Yeah, I was like, you&#8217;re exactly right. This is exactly what I want to do. And that&#8217;s where it started. I feel, I feel really fortunate that I&#8217;m someone who got a degree in something that I&#8217;m actually still doing.<br>
I guess it was a few years ago, I reached out to her because we&#8217;re friends on Facebook. I thanked her. I didn&#8217;t remember if I&#8217;d ever thanked her, but my whole career came from that decisive moment where she told me about something I didn&#8217;t know about. And then I ran with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m trying to think, I&#8217;m trying to place this in time because we talked earlier about early nineties. So this is mid nineties or so.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So this is mid nineties. Yep. Mid nineties. Actually&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. When you said&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
&#8230;ended up graduating with my BFA in graphic design and December of &#8217;97.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Tell me what it was studying design back then, because you also have the big advent of the personal computer. You&#8217;ve got the coming of the internet as we know it. What was it studying design during that time?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Man, it was wild. I mean, first and foremost, we&#8217;re working on Apple Performs 4500s I think was the model number.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
And I mean these things were tanks and dinosaurs. You could have Photoshop open, only, or Illustrator, but not both. And if, we&#8217;re talking 32 megabytes of RAM and I mean lots of crashes, so you had to frequently save your work. We definitely did some cut and paste stuff because that was just not too far out of the rear view mirror that people were still making the migration to computer. So there was still a lot of manual cut and copy and paste, cut and paste design, lot of assemblage, a lot of that stuff was still going on. So of course it was part of our curriculum.<br>
And I&#8217;ll tap into my photography side as well. I always find it a little bit of a, for me, I paid my dues. It was a rite of passage that I actually got to do photography. I got to take photos using film and understand the value of the frame and not just take in 450 shots and hoping there&#8217;s a good one in there. And then actually developing my film in the dark room, all that stuff was happening around the same time, which all feels of course very archaic now. But that was the start. That was what it was like back then.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean it sounds like it was just really hands on because the computer couldn&#8217;t do everything. I mean, it could do some things, but you still, like you said, have to do copy and paste, or cut and paste, or you still have to take photos and develop them yourself. It&#8217;s so wild now when I think about digital cameras, because I remember in high school having Fun Saver cameras. You go to the party, you have your Fun Saver camera, you take all kind of shots, you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re going to get back until you get it back from Eckerd or wherever that you got them developed at. But yeah, and I took a photography course back then too, so I know about developing in the dark room and stuff, which now seems&#8230; It&#8217;s funny. I&#8217;ll watch a movie or something and they always paint it as this, I don&#8217;t know, old school way of doing things. Developing. And it&#8217;s not that far away from now.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
No. No. And honestly it&#8217;s become of a niche for some people. I know a lot of people that actually I say a lot, but a handful of people that are still shooting film and still developing in that handful of dark rooms that are left. And it&#8217;s something, I think maybe they embrace it, not because they&#8217;re too stubborn to switch to digital, but it&#8217;s a craft for them. Some of them are people that have embraced digital, but they also still really love film. I admire that. I think it&#8217;s great. I don&#8217;t miss it. I don&#8217;t miss the smelling the smell of fixer and then and not knowing what you&#8217;re going to get until you are dropping it into the developer and hoping that you nailed it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I could imagine even doing design back then because computers were changing and software was changing and everything. Were there trends back then? I&#8217;m just curious because I feel like a lot of stuff still carried over from print, but were there specific graphic design trends that you remember from back then?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean I think there was a time where decorative fonts were really starting to become prevalent. And you started, I mean this was quite honestly, I think this was when fonts like Hobo were actually still being used.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Oh yeah, yeah. Papyrus. Yeah, I feel like there was a exploration&#8230; Fonts just exploded. And with the advent of the computer, fonts started off trickling in and then they exploded. And I think designers had to be really disciplined to not, I feel like most designers were going really far out and using all these crazy decorative fonts and still having their design disciplines about them. So they may only use one decorative font and a nice San Serif that balanced it. But those fonts were not elegant, at all. And it of course, depending on what you were trying to do with it. And I think what has happened, we&#8217;ve seen from a time where people were trying to get away from using the tried and true fonts, the Adobe Garamond, the Futura. People were feeling like those were overused or they were too basic and so they had to expand their typeface horizons. And then I find these days, man, some of the best brands go back to basics and are going back to some of those tried and true fonts and looking for things that are a little more elegant.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I didn&#8217;t even think about the proliferation of typefaces as something that was part of design back then, but it was. I mean really because you had, of course, greater displays that were coming out and you could just do more than what you could do with print in terms of the types of typefaces. You just had different things.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
I think that was it. I think it was so many people were used to doing manual print design and then all of a sudden you&#8217;ve got access to 3000 fonts. Hold me back.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
That&#8217;s exactly what it was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you graduate from Maryville. You&#8217;re out there in the real world as a designer. What was that early postgrad career like? Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So the first thing I did, so going back to that whole wanting to be an entrepreneur thing, that still was in me. I still definitely wanted to have my own business and I started actually working with clients before I graduated. I worked at Office Depot, so I met a lot of people and there were people coming in that needed business cards, but they were really awful designs that they had or they didn&#8217;t have one at all. And I said, &#8220;Well this is what I do.&#8221; So I started developing a clientele before I even graduated and then spent the first year postgrad being an entrepreneur, working in the basement of the apartment that I lived at in at the time, it was actually a townhome, doing branding work. And it was mostly just branding and identity systems that I was doing early on. But about a year into that, being someone that&#8217;s super social, I started to get that cabin fever and wasn&#8217;t around people as much as I&#8217;d like to be.<br>
And so I had a side job working at Circuit City. On one particular day I was venting about, man, I really think I want to work in an agency or a company. And there was a guy by the name of Mike whose dad headed up a division of Lid Industries, which Lid is a Fortune 500 company and they had a division in St. Louis called PRC. The acronym got dissolved, so I don&#8217;t know what it ever originally meant, but it was in PRC. Anyway, they were hiring a resident graphic designer and at the time, you&#8217;ll appreciate this, in terms of historical relevance in the design and web design world. They had a Macromedia authorized training facility and I got the interview, got the job. They wanted me to teach Flash and Fireworks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So I ended up being the only guy in St. Louis teaching Flash through a Macromedia authorized program. And so that really just kicked off all kinds of just awesome awesomeness in my career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, I know you were in high demand back then. Cause Flash was everywhere. Everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Everywhere and everything. And that was right at the onset of its popularity. So I stayed with that company for about a year, ended up, gosh, being in a big metropolitan area, teaching Flash was awesome. So I ended up getting hired away by a information graphics company called Xplain. And I ended up being their interactive team leader. That was pretty exciting. Did that, ended up teaching at Washington University while I was there because the Art and Design faculty at Washington University wanted to learn Flash. I did a summer workshop for the Art and Design faculty. They loved it so much they invited me to create a multimedia class as part of their visual communications curriculum based on Flash and other video and other multimedia applications. And that was amazing. And I ended up partnering with a lot of design agencies in the St. Louis area, fairly large agencies because they didn&#8217;t have a web team or division.<br>
So that was cool. I ultimately got laid off from Xplain. They went through four rounds of layoffs. I went in the last round and because they still needed the work that I did, they became my first client. So that&#8217;s how I started Curve Theory in 2000, and or in 2001. It was just one of those things. I was still popular, the work was still necessary, the company was needing to make some pivots. And that was a blessing on my end because I always wanted to have my own business business. And that&#8217;s how it happened. I started, I launched Curve Theory with them as my first client 21 years ago.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I mean, I can&#8217;t think of a better way to roll into entrepreneurship like that. You were already super highly sought out for your design work in another medium. The company you&#8217;re working with goes out of business. You start your own business. That&#8217;s perfect. That&#8217;s a perfect handoff.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, it was. And they didn&#8217;t go out of business, thankfully. They did go back to their original, I think they grew to like 45 employees at one point, but they went back to the original 13 and they&#8217;re still around a day and they&#8217;re still thriving. But yeah, it&#8217;s getting kicked out of the nest but then given a nice little mattress to land on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
It was great. And I really love St. Louis, but I definitely knew that at some point I was going to want to leave St. Louis.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So what brought you to North Carolina?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
So at the time, the woman that I was dating was also in that same head space that she was ready to leave St. Louis. I was still teaching in Washington University and then actually had just been encouraged by the design chair, the Art and Design faculty chair to apply for this tenure track position that was opening up in the Art and Design department. And so I was at this crossroads where in my heart I knew I really didn&#8217;t want to stay in St. Louis that much longer. Things&#8230; I had envisioned leaving St. Louis almost as soon as I graduated but things kept falling into place career wise, which was great because those things were setting me up. But at one point my partner and I, ex-partner and I, were having these frequent conversations about where we would ever relocate to and at one point I mentioned that a good buddy of mine had in passing talked about moving to North Carolina.<br>
And so I asked her, &#8220;What do you know about North Carolina?&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Oh my god, Asheville. Asheville is absolutely amazing. You would love it. Check it out.&#8221; And of course, since we had the web then, I looked it up and I mean, I think within 20 minutes I knew it&#8217;s where I wanted to be. It wasn&#8217;t landlocked. There&#8217;s a four hour drive to the ocean. Mountains, waterfalls, streams everywhere. Hiking trails, mountain bike trails, you name it. That&#8217;s the kind of guy that I was. I mean, thankfully had a father who raised me. In the time I spent with him, we would go camping and hiking. And so early on I garnered a love or appreciation of the outdoors.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so you had the job that allowed you to do this work from anywhere. So why not go to a place you really want to go?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Absolutely. I actually, I had to finish that first semester at Washington University and then I had the whole spring semester. So this was in 2023. Loved that semester, loved my students. Finished that semester, turned in my grades in May and the following weekend was Memorial Day weekend. I&#8217;d literally moved a week after I turned in my grades and never looked back.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. And you&#8217;ve been there ever since.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
And been here ever since.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. You&#8217;ve been a part of the Asheville design community now for such a long time. You mentioned your community work earlier and you&#8217;re the founding president of AIGA Asheville, a new chapter. What was behind bringing an AIGA chapter to Asheville?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a great question, Maurice. So for me, one of the things I did mention that I was on the board for the St. Louis chapter in the mix there. I think I joined the chapter while I was, might have been while I was still at Lid in PRC, but I know I did two or three years on the board as their web chair for the St. Louis chapter. And I really love that community of design, the comradery, the people that you surround yourself with understand your day to day trials and tribulations, they get it. So that was, I really appreciated that as it pertained to the design community in St. Louis. And I got to Asheville and we didn&#8217;t have that. As a matter of fact, I was trying to find designers just to connect with, just to network with and they just weren&#8217;t around.<br>
I think I had maybe three or four design friends at the time, but we knew there were more designers in and around the area, there just wasn&#8217;t anything in place to help bring them out. Out of the woodwork. And so we had a lot of early conversations about, I would reach out to these other designers that I knew in the area and tell them how much I wanted to have a chapter in Asheville, because the closest chapters were in Knoxville and Charlotte. It&#8217;s a couple hour drive each way in either direction. And so for me, just selfishly, I&#8217;m like, God, I want that here. I don&#8217;t want to drive two hours to have community. It took a while. Originally you had to have 40 sustaining members just to even be considered to have a chapter. And I think given the fact that we were having a hard time finding 20 designers in Asheville at the time, that was a tall order.<br>
So we ended up creating this thing called Design Salon, which ended up being a hang for designers in the area. And the more people gathered, the more the work got spread out, and the more designers you realized were here. The more you understood that there were some really talented people that were in Asheville. And because Asheville is such a draw for people all over the world, somebody that&#8217;s here now probably wasn&#8217;t here two weeks ago. That&#8217;s how&#8217;s how it works. There was a woman named Jamie Farris who&#8217;s also a really good friend of mine that took Design Salon and started adding programming to it, and that made it even better. And so the more program she added, the better. The more it had an actual format instead of just being a creative hangout, the more I saw that we were there, it was time.<br>
And so 2019 was when I had a feasibility meeting. I just called a bunch of people that I knew and they invited other people and I said, &#8220;Hey, I think it&#8217;s time to finally start a chapter.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t actually know the requirements had changed in my mind. I was still thinking 40 sustaining members. So half the way through, we learned that it was only 20 sustaining members, but we actually turned in our petition to become a chapter with 43 sustaining members, I think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh nice.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Just because we are a little bit of a smaller city and I wanted to show how bad we really wanted to be a chapter.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
And from that first meeting I was able to build our first board of really awesome and engaged founding board members. So yeah, we started literally the year before the pandemic and have thrived through the pandemic and we&#8217;re still kicking it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is amazing. That&#8217;s amazing to hear that. And now when you say sustaining members, is that members at a particular membership tier? Because I feel like they had that at one&#8230; I feel like sustaining was one of the, if not the top, but one of the top tiers you have to have.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, I think Design Leader was the one after that. I think the sustaining member was at the $250 giving level and then it went to Design Leader, which doubled to 500.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
And so that is, especially for a professional association, that was a lot to ask, but I was just elated that many people wanted it to and believed in us having a chapter that much that they signed up. We still have a tremendous amount of sustaining members. We probably have more sustaining members than we have in any other giving level. And they have changed the price structure and the names of the giving levels a bit. And so it&#8217;s, I think easier now than ever to join the AIGA and I feel like that was part of the reason behind just sort making it a little simpler, especially after the pandemic. But yeah, it&#8217;s quite wonderful to be in a city that now has a chapter. We have great programming. We&#8217;re putting on our first design weekend, which is a mini design week that&#8217;s coming up at the end of the month.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh. Very nice.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, first weekend of October, so it&#8217;s September 30th through October 2nd. Super excited about that. We got David Carson coming to speak at our annual meeting in November. That&#8217;s going to be pretty cool, Mr. Masterclass himself. So yeah, we&#8217;re happy to have a chapter and we&#8217;re happy to be able to have such a positive impact on our design community and that means everything for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at your career and all your experiences, is this how you imagine yourself when you were a kid in St. Louis?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
No, not at all. And it&#8217;s funny because I think being a kid in St. Louis and growing up where I grew up, I feel like my grandmother knew and saw my potential, but I didn&#8217;t see it because it&#8217;s hard. I&#8217;m surrounded by the things that I was surrounded by. And I think it&#8217;s hard to see the forest through the trees when you&#8217;re in that scenario. And for me, I don&#8217;t think, honestly, I still get surprised. I think at some point in your life, Maurice, when you&#8217;ve accomplished a lot, when you&#8217;ve done a lot, when you&#8217;ve had this longevity of experiences and learning, at some point you start to realize that people see that in you and they see all the experience and all the leadership and the guidance and they start to seek it out.<br>
I get called to be on boards, I turned down probably seven board positions last year. I&#8217;m publicly a leader. And so I think it still surprises me sometimes where, and I think it also surprises me that sometimes somebody asks me a question and I think I&#8217;m still that 25 year old in school and still on his path figuring things out, and learning, and discovering. But then I start to answer, I hear the question and then my head just gets filled with all of this relevant information that you don&#8217;t even really think about. You&#8217;re not just sitting around thinking about all the stuff, but when someone calls and asks for mentoring or it&#8217;s a colleague you&#8217;re just shooting a breeze with. You start to realize how much of that stuff is in there and it&#8217;s quite amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What gives you purpose to keep doing the work that you do now?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
I think for me it&#8217;s those relationships and experiences. I&#8217;ve always said that if I won the lottery and had all the money that I would ever need, I would still be a designer. I would still do design, I would just do mostly nonprofit work, and do it pro bono, and just take a select number of projects a year. I love the work, I&#8217;m passionate about the work, and I&#8217;m passionate about the people that I get to work with. I&#8217;m very particular about the clients. If a client doesn&#8217;t seem like they&#8217;re the right fit or I&#8217;m not going to have a mutually enjoyable experience, then I&#8217;ll pass on a project. And I&#8217;m pretty thankful to be in a place in my career where I can do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give for someone who, they&#8217;re listening to this interview, they&#8217;re hearing how you&#8217;ve come up throughout your career. What advice would you give somebody that wants to follow in your footsteps?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
I would say, and I talk to young people all the time, I actually mentor. And the thing that I feel like is the most important is to really keep exploring who you are and what you like, and don&#8217;t follow the money. I feel like it&#8217;s very easy to, I&#8217;ll talk back to a time in my life when I worked at Office Depot when I was Florissant Valley in Junior College, I was asked to get into the managerial track at Office Depot where at the time I might have made, once becoming a manager, I may have made $35,000 or $30,000, which at the time seemed like a lot of money. And that&#8217;s a very easy distraction. That&#8217;s a very easy temptation. And I had a friend at the time who also was a really, really talented artist. He also was wanting to go to design school.<br>
He ended up getting in that track and hated it. It just completely dominated his life. He wasn&#8217;t fulfilled. The money at some point wasn&#8217;t even relevant because he never had time to spend any of it because he worked so much. I turned it down because I knew, I think at this point I was already at Maryville University, so I was already in the graphic design program. I knew that that&#8217;s what I wanted to do. So in order to get to that point, you have to do some self exploration. You have to understand who you are, what it is that you really value and set your sites on being able to do that for a living. And don&#8217;t waiver.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What sort of work would you like to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Man, I would love to retire in five years. I&#8217;m 51. So that&#8217;s definitely a tall order, but in a perfect world, I might completely crush it for the next five, six years or so and retire early, or at least partially retire. But I do see myself in leadership. I do see myself still trying to bring positive change to communities in whatever way I can. Through social justice, through design leadership, through, I&#8217;ve hinted at the thought of being, it&#8217;s been mentioned and it&#8217;s been a internal conversation and conversation I&#8217;ve had with colleagues about the AIGA trajectory, and perhaps maybe serving on a national board at some point. I have friends on the national board. I love the organization and I love what the organization provides to the design community. And I always see its potential is limitless and to be able to serve in that world at a higher level, definitely. But yeah, that&#8217;s probably something that I would look to within my five year trajectory. And more than anything, I always want to make sure that the work that I&#8217;m doing continues to be meaningful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think you should definitely consider it. I mean, I&#8217;ve done work at the volunteer level, at the national level, and it&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s been great. I highly think you should do it. And I&#8217;m sure other people have probably mentioned this to you as well, but there&#8217;s a book in your story. There&#8217;s a hundred percent a book in your story.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Yeah, I don&#8217;t know if anyone&#8217;s outright said that, but I definitely know there&#8217;s stuff in there that I always find it intriguing to look back in my past and see where I&#8217;ve been, and where I am, and how I&#8217;ve been inspired, and how I&#8217;m now able to inspire. That all is important to me. But yeah, thanks for saying that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, no, there&#8217;s a hundred percent a book in your story. I mean, one, I think just because of how you have managed yourself through how design and technology have changed, but then also I think your personal story added in as a layer on top of that. And with the work that you&#8217;re doing now through volunteering and giving back, that&#8217;s the best seller. You might want to think about it. You might want to think about it. I&#8217;m just saying I&#8217;m putting it out there.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Thanks. You&#8217;ll get their first copy for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Absolutely. So curvetheory.com. C-U-R-V-E-T-H-E-O-R-Y dot com is my commercial website. There is a link to my print work on there, which yeah, prints are great, but if you want to see the bulk of my commercial photography, landscape stuff, nature, and cityscapes, that&#8217;s a good place to go. I also am on Instagram Curve Theory on Instagram. And there I don&#8217;t really put a whole lot of design work on. I do have a separate account that I&#8217;m hoping to start building up my, putting all my design work on, but really photography&#8230; Years ago I had a mix of photography and design and it always just felt all over the place for me. And one of the things I always noticed when I go to other Instagram accounts and I see these really nicely curated feeds that everything just, there&#8217;s something nice about the continuity and you&#8217;re like beautiful landscapes, and then there&#8217;s a logo. It just feels odd placed. And so I took all my design stuff off of there and it&#8217;s just my photography on my Instagram account. But those are the best places to find me. And I&#8217;m also on LinkedIn. Reggie Tidwell on LinkedIn.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, Sounds good. Well, Reggie Tidwell, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I mean, of course, like I just mentioned about there&#8217;s a book in you, your story and the passion and the service that you&#8217;ve given back to the design community is something that I think is really inspiring for a lot of people. Certainly your local community. But I hope that people that listen to this interview also pick up on that as well, because you mentioned being raised by your grandmother and her being a teacher, those values that she instilled in you, you&#8217;re continuing to give those back out to the community, which are really the basis of your success. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Reggie Tidwell:</b><br>
Hundred percent agree about my grandmother, and thank you so much for having me on, Maurice. It&#8217;s been a pleasure talking with you.</p>

<p>These past two years have been stressful for all of us in a lot of ways, but this week&#8217;s guest is proof that you can find a way to redirect those feelings into something positive. Meet Roneka Patterson, an associate creative director at Hawkeye in Dallas, Texas, and the co-creator of <a href="https://unwrittenrulesproject.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The Unwritten Rules</a>.</p>
<p>Roneka and I talked about adjusting to work from home life, and she shared a bit about her process and what it&#8217;s like to be a creative director. From there, we discussed The Unwritten Rules, including how the project was launched last summer with other Black creatives, and she shared how she got Hawkeye on board with amplifying its message. Roneka also spoke about mentorship and how she&#8217;s helping local high schoolers discover their creativity as well. Roneka&#8217;s motto &#8212; &#8220;keep going&#8221; &#8212; is one I think we can all adopt as we move forward and chart our own paths to success in this industry!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I&#8217;m Roneka Patterson. I&#8217;m an associate creative director with an art director background. I work at Hawkeye, which is an agency, an ad agency in Dallas, Texas. I&#8217;ve been at Hawkeye for about four and a half years, and I work on the Capital One account. So we do just basically a little bit of everything for Capital One, but a lot of CRM and direct mail, email messaging for them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now we&#8217;ve had quite a few advertising folks on the show, probably since the beginning of Revision Path, but certainly over the past year or so. How has it been adjusting to the work from home life?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s had its ups and downs. I think when we first started last year, there was definitely a lot of anxiety for me. I&#8217;m kind of an introvert and so I really relished having my time at my home with my family away from work. I think there was just a lot of nervousness on our team when we first went home. I was just getting pinged all night, 7:00, 8:00, 9:00 at night through our messaging apps. Finally had to like, &#8220;Guys, we still need to have some boundaries here even though we&#8217;re at home.&#8221; So that stuff has kind of leveled out, but there&#8217;s still I&#8217;ve three year old daughter and so there&#8217;s times when she&#8217;s at home trying to work and my wife and I are juggling who&#8217;s got her now. It&#8217;s been a challenge.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll say that from a creative standpoint, I don&#8217;t feel like the work for our team has dipped any. I feel like we&#8217;ve actually been a little bit more creative working from home. I don&#8217;t know. I think there&#8217;s a freedom of being able to work at your own pace with things, whereas if you&#8217;re in an office there&#8217;s a little bit more like, &#8220;Okay, how are things coming,&#8221; you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
But this has definitely been my most creative year in a while in terms of just the types of ideas that I&#8217;ve had, the thinking I&#8217;ve been able to do. I&#8217;m grateful for that. It&#8217;s been ups and downs, definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How long did it take for you to get into a groove where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, I can do this day to day.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Oh, man. I think maybe over the summer. Maybe the fall of last year, of 2020, I think that&#8217;s when things kind of started to level out. So it was a good six months of it just being very chaotic. Not chaotic in the sense like, &#8220;Oh, I wish we could go back to the office,&#8221; but just this is just a lot. And I know that it&#8217;s a lot more than it would be if we were in the office. I think that fall is pretty much when it started to feel like okay, I feel like I&#8217;ve got the handle of this and it just wasn&#8217;t as intense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about your work at Hawkeye. You mentioned you&#8217;re an associate creative director. Is the Capital One account the only project you&#8217;re working on or do you work with other clients?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah, I work with a couple of other clients just on project by project basis. I&#8217;m dedicated to Capital One. Our team that I work on, there&#8217;s about 30 of us. I think we&#8217;re one of the larger accounts in the agency and so we work pretty much primarily on them. But there are little things that come in the door that we can help out with for other clients. So I&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s about a 90/10 split.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So let&#8217;s say a new project comes in. Talk to me about that process. Where do you come in? How do you work with the particular client? How does that work?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So as an associate creative director, I&#8217;m a half manager, half hands kind of person, I think moving a little bit more towards manager. So basically when a project comes in, I&#8217;m helping staff the job. So it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, we think this project is going to need two art directors and a writer, or two art directors and two writers.&#8221; I&#8217;ll help with that and then I&#8217;ll just be providing oversight and guidance as those projects happen. So I&#8217;m helping out with brainstorming, helping check files to make sure that they&#8217;re built correctly per the standards of the client. Basically just oversight.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Occasionally I&#8217;ll still get in there and do some design work. If we&#8217;re a little understaffed and we&#8217;ve got some people out on PTO, I can definitely help out in those cases. But generally just providing oversight and guidance based on the experience that I&#8217;ve had working on the account.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so how long did it take you to get to that point within Hawkeye? Because I would imagine coming in you have to work your way up to that, right?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah. So I&#8217;ve been an associate creative director for a year and a half now. I think it&#8217;ll be two years in January. So prior to that I was a senior art director, and so a lot of what I was doing was the associate creative director level of things where I&#8217;m having to lead presentations and oversight on jobs. It hasn&#8217;t changed much, but yeah, a lot of it was just getting familiar with the company, getting familiar with the team, establishing a name for myself on the team. And then again, just starting to do that next level of work that finally they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, yeah, you should definitely be doing this job because you should be getting paid for this because that&#8217;s the job that you&#8217;ve been doing.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s a typical day for you working at Hawkeye?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So a typical day for me now, a lot of meetings. Whether it&#8217;s kickoff calls, like we&#8217;re kicking off new jobs, status calls just to see what everyone on the team is working with and help allot resources for the different projects. We do a lot of check-ins. Our account is very agile, so they love to meet. They&#8217;d much rather over communicate than things get dropped. And so we&#8217;ll do a lot of check-ins internally with our creative folks, like this is how the work is coming along. We&#8217;ll give feedback, we&#8217;ll do check-ins.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Capital One has their own robust creative department, so we&#8217;ll do check-ins with them to make sure that the work that we&#8217;re creating meets the brand needs. And then we&#8217;ll do check-ins with the client, the business managers who&#8217;ve actually requested the work. So a lot of meetings. In between there is time for brainstorms and occasional sketching, but a lot of it is just making sure that things are moving properly, that creative folks have the help they need so if they&#8217;re stuck on something or if they need an extra set of eyes on something, providing that support. But that&#8217;s pretty much how my days go nowadays.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s something that you think people underestimate about your role?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So when you&#8217;re at a CD level, and this may be me making assumption about that level, there&#8217;s a lot more strictly oversight. It&#8217;s understood that your job is to lead and to direct. With an associate creative director, you&#8217;re kind of in this in between area where there&#8217;s an expectation that if we get in a jam, you&#8217;re going to have to help out designing something or laying out something. Because of that, even though my workload, it may look like Roneka is only designing on a couple of things, I&#8217;m actually overseeing seven or eight things. So I think sometimes there&#8217;s the assumption that because you don&#8217;t see me doing the art direction stuff, that I&#8217;m not doing direction.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s one of those things, it&#8217;s not like a woe is me type of thing, but it&#8217;s something that I didn&#8217;t realize about the role before I got into it was just that there&#8217;s a lot of oversight takes time, to make sure to check in projects, to be able to switch on a dime to remembering, where are we at with this one? What kind of feedback can I give here that would be helpful? Presenting to clients, just being able to manage if something goes wrong and how do you talk to that? How do you speak to that in the moment? There&#8217;s just a lot of that kind of stuff that I think I wasn&#8217;t cognizant of before I got into the role.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve heard that from other folks that are in advertising as well, so what you&#8217;re saying definitely lines up with that. I want to go more into your background. I know you&#8217;re at Hawkeye, which is located in Dallas. Are you originally from Dallas?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m from Austin, which is about three hours south of Dallas, so I didn&#8217;t go very far. Yeah, most of my family is from the Dallas Fort Worth area and my parents just kind of branched down to Austin and had me. I just stuck down there while I grew up and then I ended up moving back to Fort Worth for school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you know early on that you were into design and advertising and all of that?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah, so I always loved art. I love to paint, I love to draw, I love sculptures. Always had a passion for that. I mean, I can do think back to grade school and just being super into that kind of stuff. So I didn&#8217;t necessarily understand how to make a career out of that in terms of what design was, what advertising, art direction, all that kind of stuff. But I knew that I was really passionate about that.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Funny, actually, when I was in middle school, I used to run track. Pretty good at it. We were city champions my eighth grade year, which was a highlight for me. When I got to high school, it&#8217;s a different ball game when you&#8217;re changing sports in high school. There was a lot of practice for running track in high school. And I remember going home with my mom one day and I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do this anymore.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I want to just focus on my art.&#8221; And my mom was like, &#8220;Well, whatever you do, just make sure you go a 100%.&#8221; So she let me get out of track and I really started focusing on art.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I was taking art classes. I got some AP credit in art that I was able to take to college with me. I loved to create, to draw. I used to joke that my favorite class in high school other than art was history class because it allowed me time to just draw. I&#8217;d sit in my seat and just draw during the class and I loved that. But that&#8217;s where that love started to really strengthen. From there I was like, &#8220;Okay, I want to go to school, to college, and I don&#8217;t know how to do this.&#8221; So I was able to find TCU had a really good graphic design program, so I was able to get into that and the rest was history.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s talk about that. Tell me what your time was like at TCU.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
It was good. It&#8217;s a small private school and there&#8217;s a lot of money that gets poured into that school. They&#8217;ve got a pretty good football program. The Black community there is pretty tight knit because I think there&#8217;s only like 8% Black students there out of the entire school. So created some camaraderie that was nice.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
In terms of the design program there, I think I was the only Black woman in my coursework, but there were other Black folks in the fine arts, studio arts degree path. So I was able to make some connections with them. Some of them I still speak to to this day.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So I think that overall, with all of the creatives that I&#8217;ve met through my career, I do feel like it was a really solid education, a really solid foundation. It taught me design fundamentals, an understanding of conceptual advertising thinking. I&#8217;ve met some folks that didn&#8217;t have one or the other, who went to an ad school or a design school. I just feel like TCU gave me a really good balance of the two things.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll say that that&#8217;s where I had my first design job. I had a professor who pulled me this side one day and he was like, &#8220;Roneka, the dining hall is hiring.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Excuse me? What&#8217;s that have to do with me?&#8221; He was like, &#8220;No, no, no.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;They have a marketing department and they&#8217;re hiring. They&#8217;re looking for a designer and so I think you should check that out. I think it might be a good fit for you.&#8221; It was great. I got to design posters and little logos for advertising around the dining hall. I got a free meal every day, which was amazing. And so that was my first design job was at TCU.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. In a way they really did prepare you for getting out there, working as a designer because you got a job working for the college while you were there.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yep. Yeah, it was awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. So when you graduated, what was your early career like? I see you worked for an agency called Sonus. Tell me about that experience.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah. So that was a privately owned small boutique marketing agency. And so I think when I got hired, there was one other designer there and then I think she left within a year so I was the sole designer there. We had an account person and me. It gave me a good foundation of these are all the things that are entailed with marketing, kind of had to do it all. I learned how to present to clients because I was the person that had to present. I did the work and I had to present the work. Timelines, budgeting, all that kind of stuff. I think I learned more in that experience than I think I would&#8217;ve learned just being dropped into an agency environment or a larger agency because there just wasn&#8217;t enough hands. I had to do a lot of it.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I left there to work at an ad agency, and I worked there for six or seven years. It was at Moroch in Dallas. That experience, high highs and low lows. I think that I got to work on a bunch of different clients. I got to do a lot of different types of projects. The range of work that I got to do there really was amazing. It was the aughts, the mid-aughts, the late-aughts, so there was a lot of&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, the reckoning that&#8217;s happened in advertising over the last year or so, that was not a thing back then. So there was a lot of just political, cultural things that just really just wore me down.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
There&#8217;s too many things to name. Just random things that happened that I think if you talk to any Black person who&#8217;s worked in corporate America, they could probably be like, &#8220;Yeah, yeah. That sounds about right.&#8221; After the time that I spent there, I left that agency and I said that I was never going to work in advertising again. I don&#8217;t care where I work. I&#8217;ll be a postal worker, I&#8217;ll work at the art museum. I don&#8217;t care. I can&#8217;t do this anymore and I don&#8217;t want to go back. This isn&#8217;t for me.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So I ended up at a greeting card company. So we did basically the B2B greeting cards, the type of cards that corporations send out during the holidays. So I worked in the marketing department there and got to lead and also just to see how things go from the business side because that&#8217;s another thing that you don&#8217;t really get to see when you&#8217;re working in an agency is just the business side of things. How are some of those decisions made? How are our agencies received? Because we worked with some freelance agencies, some of our projects and just sitting on the other side of the table, how are those things received?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So I did that for a little while and then I started to get the itch about potentially moving back into an agency environment. I&#8217;d said for myself it needed to be the right agency. It needed to be the right environment. I needed to feel safe. I don&#8217;t mean safe in the sense of boring, but safe as a Black queer woman, am I going to be safe in that environment? Am I going to have opportunities in that environment? So that&#8217;s how I ended up at Hawkeye. Actually, I got interviewed by two women who were creative directors and immediately I was like, &#8220;Okay, this may be it.&#8221; I&#8217;d never actually worked with a female creative director before in my entire career. So that was a very big reason why I wanted to work there. There are a bunch of other women creative directors at Hawkeye, which was really, really comforting for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is it that appealed to you about going back to work at an agency?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I missed the creative department. I missed having a team of other creatives that you could bounce ideas off of, that could help push you and help push your work. I missed that. I missed having writers that could help me generate ideas and say it in a way, a lot more concisely than I could say it. I missed all of that. I missed the direction and just opportunities to just solve different types of business problems for people. I missed all that.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I didn&#8217;t realize it when I left that first agency, but I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I definitely miss&#8230;&#8221; When you don&#8217;t have it, that&#8217;s when you realize, yeah, there&#8217;s some value in having people around you that are super smart and super talented and they can just help make your work better. Also, they get it. You&#8217;re not having to explain and reexplain why creative is valuable and why it&#8217;s important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s good that you had that break after working for two agencies for a long time. You can sort of separate yourself a bit from it. There&#8217;s that saying that hindsight is 2020. So you&#8217;re able to then look back and say, &#8220;All right, well, these are things I liked and this is why I want to have more of these things and maybe less of something else.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yep. You got it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you talk about encountering a female creative director and that&#8217;s sort of what made you decide to work with Hawkeye, but did you encounter a lot of Black creatives in advertising throughout your career?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
A handful, Maurice, a handful. when I was at Moroch I think there was about maybe five of us total Black creatives there. Traditionally in advertising, I met more Black strategists, account folks, relationship management folks. We had a few of those there. But creative, it was just few and far between really, and it was very discouraging.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I never saw anyone that outranked me. It was either a peer or someone that was a junior level. It gets in your head a little bit because you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, maybe this is not thing that women can do. Maybe this is not a thing that Black women can do to be leaders, to be creative leaders.&#8221; I know logically that&#8217;s not true. I keep an eye on the industry, I know that that&#8217;s a thing that happens outside of where I&#8217;m at right now. But when you&#8217;re young coming up, you just don&#8217;t know. I was like, &#8220;Maybe I have to move account side or move into strategy and that will allow me to grow, have advancement.&#8221; But yeah, it messes with your head a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you found now that you&#8217;re more into your career in terms of tenure that you&#8217;ve encountered more Black creatives?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely, definitely. I&#8217;ve gotten a lot more comfortable and confident with networking. Like I said earlier, there is a camaraderie that we have, those of us in this business, even if we don&#8217;t know each other. There&#8217;s just a little like, &#8220;Oh, yep, yep, yep.&#8221; You know you&#8217;re probably fighting some of the same battles and trying to champion some of the same causes. And so yeah, I definitely, any time I&#8217;m out and about, whether it&#8217;s an industry thing, an industry event or a conference or something, I&#8217;m definitely connecting with folks because you just never know.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
You never know when you&#8217;ll run into those folks again, there may be an opportunity that you can provide someone or vice versa. I see a lot more now and I&#8217;m able to connect with a lot more now, which is really, really nice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You created a project called The Unwritten Rules, which you did in conjunction with a former Revision Path guest we had on the show before, Alex Pierce, along with some other Black creatives. Talk to me about that. How did this come about?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah, so this came about last summer. Obviously we had just a period of months of just&#8230; It was like a drumbeat of violence against Black people. Shootings and police violence and intimidation and gaslighting. Obviously a lot of that, the feelings of that culminated with George Floyd&#8217;s passing, murder rather.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So Alex reached out to me and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m going to get some folks together to see if there&#8217;s just something that we can do or create just to get some of our feelings out about what&#8217;s happening.&#8221; And so I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yep, just invite me to the meeting. I&#8217;ll be there.&#8221; There was about 20 of us, and so mostly creatives, couple of strategy folks. And Hawkeye, like most agencies, it&#8217;s a predominantly white agency, but the Black creatives there, we all have a side group chat and we keep in contact with each other, check in with each other. It was Alex and myself and Adam Johnson who&#8217;s a Black copywriter formerly, at Hawkeye. He was at Hawkeye at the time. Couple of other creatives.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
We just talked, the Black folks on the team, we just kind of talked. We were like, &#8220;What are we feeling? What message can we say? What can we create? What can we do?&#8221; We did some brainstorming, we just did some really just brainstorming. What could we do? What could we create? We settled in this idea about these rules, these unwritten rules that Black folks all know that the larger population may not be cognizant of. In the conversation, it was just a little bit like, &#8220;What if we came up with an encyclopedia or just a foundry of these different rules?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
We talked a lot about tone because part of the thing last year that happened with a lot of agencies, immediately there was a lot of like, &#8220;Things are bad and here&#8217;s your black square and we need to do better. And we will.&#8221; Okay, great. It was like the universal we need to do better. Okay. We&#8217;ve been telling you that for a while, but okay. I&#8217;m glad you caught up. Tonally, we were like, &#8220;These rules are not melodramatic, trauma porny kind of stuff.&#8221; As a Black person, they don&#8217;t make me feel anything other than, yeah, this is just the way we have to&#8230; These are the things we have to know to stay safe and to avoid craziness.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
It was very similar, in a lot of ways, to we&#8217;re doing some research on The Green Book If you read The Green Book, or any of The Green Books, there is a very matter of fact tone about the fact that this magazine needed to be created to keep Black people safe. It wasn&#8217;t like a so and so got lynched yesterday. It was very much like, &#8220;Hey, if you&#8217;re going to be driving to El Paso, here&#8217;s a body shop that you can go and get your car serviced. They won&#8217;t hassle you.&#8221; Very matter of fact. That kind of tone resonated with us. It made sense to us as Black folks. Again, these are rules that we just have to know, and we thought it would be a great matter of fact way to present these rules.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
One of the main things that we really wanted to do with it was not just to say, &#8220;Hey, these are rules that Black people need to know.&#8221; But the so what. So what is here&#8217;s some data that backs up why this rule is a thing. Here are some things that you, person who&#8217;s reading this rule, can do to help make this situation better. For all of the rules that we have that we outlined, we came up with some different resources that we thought would help pay off. You read this rule, here&#8217;s something if you want to get involved, here&#8217;s a thing that you can do that can hopefully help make this rule not be a thing anymore, to erase that rule.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
And so once we solidified this idea, we did some design exploration. There&#8217;s a designer at our agency. Her name is Rosie Ulloa, I always mispronounce her name. But she helped create the visual, the color scheme, the fonts, the visual direction for this. And from there, we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, we&#8217;re going to build a website. We&#8217;re going to do a social media campaign. We&#8217;re going to start creating some things with this.&#8221; And so from there, we started developing the website and we had an interactive designer, a web developer rather, from the company who was able to donate his time to help us build this thing. From there, it was once we had the look established we started working on our social calendar, because we did want to do an entire social media campaign that&#8217;s tied to this website to help promote the website. We wanted to do some user generated content. We want people to write in about rules that they&#8217;ve experienced that we may not have covered.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
The website ended up being pretty robust just from a researching standpoint. We did the audio, we did audio narration of all the rules so you&#8217;ll hear my voice on the website in some spots. We really wanted to do a full audio visual kind of multidimensional thing.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s kind of the origin of it. We did this on our own time. I do think the pandemic helped make this a thing. I think had we been in the office it would&#8217;ve been a little bit more challenging to, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re meeting on the fourth floor at four,&#8221; kind of thing. It&#8217;s a lot easier to just, here&#8217;s a Zoom link. Let&#8217;s link up. Just a lot of nights and weekends and some holidays just turning on it and refining it and getting the content, the writing.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
We had some great writers that have helped flesh things out. Oversight is what I was talking about earlier, making sure that the tone is right and making sure that we&#8217;re not saying things that are improper. Yeah, it was a big thing. At a certain point we had to tell our agency, &#8220;Hey, this is the thing that we built.&#8221; And they were super supportive. It was really just a passion project that&#8217;s still going, still reviewing social posts once a week. But yeah, it was a side of desk thing that took a lot of love and heart and we wanted to do it for Black people so that when Black folks see it they&#8217;ll know we got you. You&#8217;re being heard. You&#8217;re not alone in that experience. And then we wanted to do it for the broader population so that they see in writing that these are things that Black folks have to be aware of and why.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You said something interesting in there I want to, I guess, learn more about. You said at some point you had to let Hawkeye know that this was something that you were doing. Why is that?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Well, we needed some support. I think part of it, we needed some legal counsel with some of the user generated content stuff, ideas that we were thinking about. We wanted to be clear with Hawkeye that, while we are all representatives of Hawkeye in our day to day, this was a separate thing. We don&#8217;t want this to be The Unwritten Rules courtesy of Hawkeye. Our CEO, Joe DeMiero, he&#8217;s a great guy. He was very much from the get go like, &#8220;Whatever you guys need, let me know. I will help provide it. We are here to support. So whatever you guys want to do.&#8221; They&#8217;ve been very, very, just the right kind of support.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
We did want to do some promoting. [inaudible 00:30:53] has 70,000 employees globally. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, can we get this on some of our inner agency communications?&#8221; They were more than willing to do that. So we got some articles in our inner agency ecosystem. Hawkeye social promoted it and they basically were providing some promotional support, which was really, really, really appreciated on our part. But yeah, that was the extent.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
One other thing that we definitely said we wanted to do from the get go is we don&#8217;t want to really submit this for awards. This is not just a how to fix racism from an ad agency. We just so happen to work at an ad agency and we&#8217;re going to use the talents that we have just because we work in advertising to do this. But this isn&#8217;t awards bait. This isn&#8217;t a play to get advertisers to care about this cause. We wanted it to be bigger than that. We wanted it to be for the general public to experience and react to. Yeah, that&#8217;s kind of how we ended up where we are now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see this project going from here?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So we have some things in the works. I&#8217;m not going to say specifically, but I probably should just to make sure we name it, claim it. Our social media calendar, we&#8217;ve got that planned out through next summer. And our social media, we&#8217;re basically taking the idea of the encyclopedia and kind of expanding it a little bit. We have a rule breaker series. These people in history who&#8217;ve broken rules, broken some of those unwritten rules. We&#8217;re doing definitions like defining what do we mean when we say defund the police? What does that mean? Sometimes just putting it in writing for people, making a record of it. We&#8217;re not the first people to talk about the unwritten rules. We&#8217;re not the first people to try to define defund the police and why it matters. But those are the types of things that we feel like The Unwritten Rules should talk about. That&#8217;s the big thing that&#8217;s continuing to happen. And like I said, we&#8217;ve got a couple of other things that we&#8217;re working on down the line.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s been the feedback so far from the project?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been positive. The best feedback I&#8217;ve gotten I think was from my family, who I&#8217;ve got Black Texans. Grew up in West Texas, East Texas, for them to be like, &#8220;This is amazing,&#8221; that says it. It says it in it&#8217;s beautiful. It says it in the right way. That&#8217;s been the best feedback for me. It&#8217;s been very, very positive, very, very affirmative. And it definitely does make the time and the love&#8230; There&#8217;s this moment when you send stuff out where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how this is going to be received. Is this going to work on Black Twitter?&#8221; Yeah, it&#8217;s been overwhelmingly positive and I think that&#8217;s part of why we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s keep going.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s good. The reason I was asking that before about why get your employer involved, because it sounded like this was something you really were all doing as a labor of love. I&#8217;m not saying this to cast dispersions on Hawkeye specifically, but I could see how an agency, particularly during this sort of time, would look at a project like that and try to claim ownership over it in some kind of way, you know?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;m sure there was probably a little twinge because there was some things that were presented to us where we had to turn it down. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, we have this newsletter.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;No. It doesn&#8217;t really align with what we&#8217;re trying to do.&#8221; It was like, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re thinking we can create a training module that&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221; Like, &#8220;No, nope. It doesn&#8217;t really align with the time commitment that we have for this, for that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I know that if it had been a specifically Hawkeye driven project, I think definitely the rollout would&#8217;ve been different. And that&#8217;s just the nature of they&#8217;re in the business. They&#8217;re trying to get clients, they&#8217;re trying to show their clients that they&#8217;re a different type of agency than they are in a lot of ways, hence the support that we got for the project. I know it&#8217;s a fine balance, but they were all very, very respectful. Our executive leadership folks, they were very, very respectful and very grateful that we did this and just very supportive of whatever you guys need, we&#8217;re going to do it. We&#8217;re going to help you make it happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. That&#8217;s really great to hear, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, in your spare time, I noticed from going through on your website, you&#8217;re quite the photographer.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you first get into photography?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve always loved photography, even back to when I was in high school, picking up, figuring out what kind of art I wanted to create. I got my first camera in college. I&#8217;d had to take some photo classes to get my degree, and love it. I love being in the lightroom. I shoot all digital now so just love the ease of that.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
But I really got more serious about taking portraits when I was working back at the first agency that I was working at. This business, it&#8217;s a grind. And so I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll meet a single person in advertising, creative, who doesn&#8217;t have some type of side hustle or is like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I do murals. I paint.&#8221; And so that just ended up being the side hustle that I really gravitated towards.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
And so I started shooting with my friends and then that had started to lead to some actual work, some paid work. And it&#8217;s something that I love to do. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve kept up with. I take classes and tutorials. I&#8217;m a part of the Black Women Photographers group. They have speakers speak to us about working photographers who talk about the business. So I&#8217;m always just soaking in all of that stuff. I hope, as I get older, that that&#8217;s something that I can retire into. I would love to do that full time in my golden years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at your career, and even to where you are right now at the moment, talk to me about mentorship. Has mentorship been something that has really helped you out throughout your career? Is this something that, at the level you&#8217;re at now, you feel you have to give back? Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
So mentorship has always been valuable to me. I feel like I&#8217;ve only in the last maybe four or five years been able to adequately provide it to others. I had to get over my issues with advertising and be able to view it in a way to where I could actually impart words of wisdom or good vibes on someone who wants to make it in this industry. But I love it. I&#8217;ve worked with the Marcus Graham Project last summer to&#8230; I had a couple of guys that I was mentoring. Anytime I&#8217;ve been around Black creatives, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s network, let&#8217;s talk. How can I connect you with something?&#8221; So it&#8217;s definitely something that I&#8217;ve pushed.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
This year, my group at Hawkeye, the team that I work on, we started a mentorship program with Dallas ISD. So there&#8217;s a school here locally, a high school, it&#8217;s mostly predominantly Black and Brown. And we wanted to teach them about advertising. We basically figured out that part of two twofold issue that&#8217;s happening with Black and Brown folks in advertising, it&#8217;s recruitment and retention, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Retention is how do we make this environment inhabitable for Black and Brown folks? Make them feel like they have a sense of community and safety. And then with recruiting, do kids know what advertising is? A lot of us backed into it. If you had asked me in high school if I wanted to work in advertising, I probably probably would&#8217;ve told you no because it sounded like, I don&#8217;t know. It sounds like suits and briefcases, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I didn&#8217;t know that it was something that I could do and still have creativity and also pay the bills every month. So we partnered up with a high school in Dallas, and so we meet with them once a month and we just tell them about advertising. At the beginning of each meeting, we have rotating people that are hosting each meeting. They&#8217;ll explain how they got into the business.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Our session that we had the week before last, we used the Apples Shot On iPhone campaign to talk about all of the different roles in an agency that would help contribute to an idea like that, to help execute a campaign like that. It was really cool. We do quizzes with them to see what kind of things did they want to be? Do you want to be a strategist? Could you see yourself being an account person who manages relationships, client relationships? Could you see yourself creative or a production role?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
And so it&#8217;s just an opportunity for us just to impart some knowledge and hopefully make some connection so that in a couple of years, when those kids are in college, they&#8217;ve got a connection with us and we can help link them up with someone. We do internships at Hawkeye, provide some opportunities for them. It&#8217;s something we&#8217;re really, really excited about. I love working with kids, so it&#8217;s just definitely fulfilling for me.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I just recently stepped down. I was the co-chair of my Delta&#8230; I&#8217;m a Delta. We have a group that we work with with middle school girls and I&#8217;d been doing that for 10 years. Finally I was like, &#8220;Okay, chapter president, I&#8217;m going to have to step down because I&#8217;m exhausted.&#8221; But picked this up just in time and so it&#8217;s just fun working with them and they&#8217;re open to learning. And hopefully we&#8217;re planting some seeds that will grow into an understanding of the business and hopefully some pathways for getting into this business.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. See, I think that&#8217;s awesome on multiple accounts. One, it goes back to that old adage of you can&#8217;t be what you don&#8217;t see. So the fact that you&#8217;re able to expose them to these career paths so early on gives them a sense of knowledge to know that this is a possibility for them to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, and I feel like also that&#8217;s the best way that you learn is by teaching. By showing other folks what it is that you know, and it can help you become more effective communicator and things of that nature. I think that&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I talk with a lot of companies and they&#8217;re always like, &#8220;Well, we have to establish a pipeline and how do we do this pipeline and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.&#8221; I never liked the term pipeline because to me pipelines always strip resources away. It&#8217;s not about putting things back into the place where you have discovered them, it&#8217;s always about take, take, take, you know?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s very kind of like Western paternalistic in some kind of way, doing that sort of thing. What you&#8217;re doing though is establishing this connection. It&#8217;s almost like you&#8217;re planting flowers in a way, you know?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Because you&#8217;re not recruiting them directly from middle school or elementary school or whatever to come work for the agency, but you&#8217;re letting them know this is what I do in case you&#8217;ve never seen this as a position. This is the work that I do and if it sounds interesting to you, then this is how you can do it as well. That opportunity is what we&#8217;re really looking to give to the next generation.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah. We took a vote. We were like, &#8220;Do we want to focus this on high schoolers or colleges?&#8221; Because we&#8217;ve got a couple of HBCUs in Texas. We could work with Paul Quinn over in Dallas. And we said there is something really nice about talking to high schoolers who are still trying to connect some of those dots, as you said, planting those flowers. Let&#8217;s say, okay, the goal of this is not to&#8230; You guys are going to be interned at Hawkeye sometime, but if we can figure out this framework, we can hand this to other agencies. Hey, you&#8217;re in Chicago. This is something you could set up with a local school in Chicago. I think we felt like there was a void. And not to say that there aren&#8217;t other people doing this elsewhere, but we knew that here in Dallas it wasn&#8217;t being done, or this way rather, because I&#8217;ve definitely worked with some other agencies before.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
But is there something unique and special that we can do just to drop some knowledge? Because there&#8217;s a big push for STEM and business. That&#8217;s great, but we&#8217;re STEAM. That A, that art. What if people have the creative? There&#8217;s this little creative nugget. Black folks are hella creative, Brown folks are hella creative. If we can make that connect connection, you that are supremely awesome at editing TikToks, that&#8217;s a production role. You could make a lot of money doing that. If we could start to make some of those connections for kids, I think we felt like we will have done our part. Obviously we&#8217;re going to do more than that, but this is definitely how we wanted to start that kind conversation with them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of that mentorship, who are some of the mentors that have helped you out in your career?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Oh, man. Honestly, I&#8217;m kind of on an Issa Rae thing where it&#8217;s been peers that have really helped me along the most. Fellow creatives who were in the trenches with me that gave me encouragement. I&#8217;ve had a couple of creative directors where it was just like, &#8220;Okay, this person is definitely&#8230;&#8221; I had a creative director when I was at Moroch that I still keep in touch with today. We&#8217;ll occasionally have lunch together. He was just super brilliant, creative and helped push me creatively.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
But yeah, a lot of it has been peers. It&#8217;s been one of the writers that I work with on The Unwritten Rules. He&#8217;s helped inspire me and just a connector. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, there&#8217;s this thing that I found out about. You should try this out.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go to the museum. I heard about this thing that&#8217;s happening.&#8221; To me, that stuff, it encourages me because being around super talented people, it just helps raise you up a little bit. But just that friendship has been invaluable to me.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t want to name drop anyone specific, but I&#8217;ll just say that it&#8217;s been a lot of people being in the trenches with me, peers that have helped push me and encourage me. And I do that for them too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are you obsessed with at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Oh, this is bad. In my personal life or my work life?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Personal life.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Oh, this is bad. So my wife and I have been watching The Haves and the Have Nots by Tyler Perry. It&#8217;s on Hulu. There&#8217;s eight seasons of it. There&#8217;s 30 episodes a season. It&#8217;s insane. We&#8217;ve been binging it. It&#8217;s a soap opera. I grew up watching soap operas. Me and my mom used to watch The Young and the Restless and my grandmother and I used to watch it together. So I kind of got out of that over the last maybe five or six years, because life just got too busy and I didn&#8217;t have time to be watching soaps every day. But yeah, we&#8217;ve gotten into it the last couple of weeks and it&#8217;s just been insane. It&#8217;s like an addiction. We just got to get one hit tonight and then we&#8217;ll&#8230; It&#8217;s crazy. But yeah, that&#8217;s probably the thing right now. It&#8217;s kind of crazy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think we&#8217;ve all got an escape show that we dive into every now and then. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that. Especially during this pandemic.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. This is a judgment free zone here. [crosstalk 00:46:25].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look, grab your creature comforts wherever you can. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I could turn my brain off and set it on the table and just zone out, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Do you feel creatively satisfied at this point in your career?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I feel like the last year and a half have allowed me to do things creatively that were kind of passion projects, explorations, just the type of work that I&#8217;ve all always wanted to work on in my career. A lot of it was the pandemic and just having the freedom, the personal freedom to do those things, to explore those things. And so, yeah, I would say I am feeling creatively fulfilled.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I&#8217;m definitely thinking about the next five or 10 years. What is that going to look like? Leadership is great. Being able to lead teams. I&#8217;m definitely doing more of that now. But the downside is that you&#8217;re not getting to create as much. You&#8217;re giving feedback and helping push other creatives to come up with really brilliant, amazing ideas. And so I think there&#8217;s always a little bit of tension with that. Do I want to continue on this path where I&#8217;m just going to be pushing and challenging and supporting? Or do I want to be in a position where I can still roll my sleeves up and do some of the work? I kind of go back and forth on that.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
But I will say, between my photography and just the personal projects that I&#8217;ve gotten to work on over the last couple of years, I do feel like I&#8217;m getting a lot of the stuff in my brain out into the world, which has been nice and fulfilling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you hope to be working on?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
I hope that I&#8217;m doing work that has positive impacts on the world. So whether that is more pro bono work, I&#8217;ve gotten to do a lot of that over the last couple of years and it&#8217;s super fulfilling for me. It&#8217;s merging the two things that I care about a lot, which is how can I help make things better out there and how can I create and express myself. So I think I would love to do more of that over the next five years.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
As I said, I&#8217;m in a leadership role now, so I would like to continue that. I&#8217;m very much a let me pull some people up with me kind of person. So that&#8217;s a natural fit for a leadership. I&#8217;m trying to find opportunities for people. I&#8217;m trying to connect people, I&#8217;m trying to make sure that especially younger creatives don&#8217;t feel grinded up in this business the way I did. I don&#8217;t want anyone to feel like I got to quit because this isn&#8217;t&#8230; I got to quit this stuff because it&#8217;s not for me. I want to definitely encourage folks and get them to find that right balance to where they are getting their fulfillment, they&#8217;re safe and they&#8217;re allowed to grow. Any ways that I can help do that, that&#8217;s what I want to be doing over the next five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and your projects and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah. So you can visit ronekapatterson.com. So it&#8217;s R-O-N-E-K-A, Patterson with two T&#8217;s, .com. I&#8217;ve got design work and photo work there. You can find me on the gram, @RonekaP. And you can find me on LinkedIn too. I think you just search Roneka Patterson, I&#8217;ll probably pop up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And we&#8217;ll also make sure to put a link to The Unwritten Rules in the show notes as well so people can check that out.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;d be awesome. Would love that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Awesome. Roneka Patterson, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. One, of course, for telling us more about this project that I&#8217;ve heard about now probably for the better part of a year, in terms of it getting around in the world and getting around amongst other Black creatives. But also about just giving your own story and testimony about being a Black creative in this industry. And that even if there are setbacks, you can still find your way towards something that&#8217;s fulfilling, which I think we all need to hear that from time to time. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Roneka Patterson:</b><br>
Thank you so much, Maurice. This has been great. I&#8217;m so glad to get to talk to you finally and just happy to be here. Thank you so much for having me.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s still pretty early in 2021, so if the year hasn&#8217;t quite gotten off to a good start, then let this week&#8217;s conversation with Lafiya Watson Ramirez be the permission you need to turn things around! Lafiya dabbles in several media &#8212; web, photography, augmented reality, mixed reality &#8212; and creates new projects for herself and for her clients through her company, <a href="https://badchickstudios.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Bad Chick Studios</a>.</p>
<p>We talked about how she started her studio, and from there she shared the resources and programs she used to teach herself AR and XR. (Spoiler alert: a lot of these tools are free!) Lafiya also spoke on how her love for photography led her to web design and learning Flash, and how embracing becoming a generalist has changed her work and how she perceives herself as a creative.</p>
<p>Get a bit of inspiration from Lafiya and learn what you can!</p>
