Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>Virtual reality used to be a science fiction trope in the 90s, but now, virtual reality is <em>actual</em> reality! Take it from this week&#8217;s guest: the one and only Andr√© Elijah. His work building games and doing marketing projects as an immersive director is sought after by brands and celebrities worldwide, including Google, Meta, Snap, Drake, and Beyonc√©. And that&#8217;s not all!</p>
<p>Our conversation began with a slight nerd-out moment about <em>VR Troopers</em> &#8212; shout-out to <a href="/michael-hollander/" data-wpel-link="internal">Michael Hollander</a>! &#8212; and then Andr√© gave a rundown about AR, VR, the metaverse, and the ins and outs of immersive experiences. He also shared a bit of his origin story as a child actor, Ryerson University grad, and becoming one of the first people in Canada to use RED cameras (which are now a worldwide industry standard). Andr√© also gave some great advice for people looking to get into the immersive space. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s more than one way to success, and Andr√© proves that you don&#8217;t have to chase VC funding to do it!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So, tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
My name is Andr√© Elijah and I&#8217;m an immersive director working in augmented reality and virtual reality.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has the year been going for you so far? I can hear from in the background that you probably have started off this year with a pretty big announcement.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Yeah, my twins are born in January. So yeah, I guess you can hear them in the background. I&#8217;ve got noise canceling headphones on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, no. You&#8217;re you&#8217;re all good. Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Thanks, dude. Yeah. It&#8217;s been a bit of a shift, but no, it&#8217;s been good. It&#8217;s been good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has it been juggling work and family? Are you sort of finding that balance now?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
No, it requires a really good partner that can take care of things on the home front while I work maniacally at all hours of the day and night.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s jump into that work a little bit. You have a studio, Andr√© Elijah Immersive, and you just recently celebrated your five year anniversary. Congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me more about it.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
It&#8217;s basically a studio where we build everything we want to see in the world. There&#8217;s multiple parts to the company. We&#8217;re building games. We see games as the major catalyst to enable these new mediums and platforms. And so we want to be there and kind of build the content that we think will sell units and sell headsets and make this augmented reality and virtual reality future pervasive. And then on the flip side, we also work with a number of agencies and brands doing marketing projects, ad campaigns, that sort of thing, building interactive elements of that, or activations, augmented reality activations, metaverse activations, all kinds of stuff. So we&#8217;re constantly busy, probably a little bit too busy, some would say, but no complaints. This year&#8217;s been absolutely mental. I think I&#8217;m really lucky in that I was able to survive this long in this industry.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
A lot of people thought that VR in particular was going to pop off multiple times already and it didn&#8217;t and really kind of found its footing during the pandemic. There&#8217;s a lot of things that came together. Everything from Oculus Quest 2 or I guess now Meta Quest 2. Everyone being at home with the pandemic and needing something to do, the rise of VR fitness was really another thing that popped off and helped sell headsets and find a user base. And so all these things coalescing at the same time allowed for me to still be here and be in business all these years later. Definitely one of the lucky ones in that regard.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
VR as a technology, I feel like has been trying to pop off since at least, I guess at least the &#8217;90s, right, the mid &#8217;90s.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s correct.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It has tried to gain some footing. The first, and this is probably weird, but the first thing I think of when I think of VR is VR Troopers. That really horrible, horrible show.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
That show. Yeah. In the &#8217;90s it was basically a riff off of the Power Rangers because there was the three VR Troopers. I remember that. There was a TV station called the New VR and they carried VR troopers. Yeah, it was a station based at a Barrie, Ontario.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow. So, interesting thing. Do you remember the black guy that was on there that played JB?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He works in gaming. I&#8217;ve had him on the show before.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
What?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
That is wild.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He told me all the behind the scenes. That show is so chopped up. It&#8217;s like the video form of, I don&#8217;t know, scrapple or something. It&#8217;s like a whole bunch of stuff taken from different shows that they cobbled together and it&#8217;s wild. It&#8217;s not even from one show. It&#8217;s from five different shows that they put together to make that show because they have different outfits in VR grid versus when they&#8217;re fighting the monsters. And it&#8217;s so funny. There&#8217;s a video on YouTube, if you want to check it out. There&#8217;s a video where the cast got drunk and did a voiceover of one of the episodes. It&#8217;s so funny. It&#8217;s so funny.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
That is awesome. This makes me really happy to hear, I&#8217;m not going to lie. It&#8217;s funny because no one knows what the hell VR Troopers is. You can mention Power Rangers and everyone knows that. Occasionally you can mention Masked Rider and people will get that because it&#8217;s just Kamen Rider. You mention VR Troopers, no one ever knows what the hell you&#8217;re talking about. So, you made me really happy right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. But to go back to my earlier point, VR has really tried to pop off since then. You had Nintendo with the failed Virtual Boy. You even had video games that had virtual or virtual in it, like Virtual Fighter. There&#8217;s been all these attempts to try to make virtual reality really a big thing. And it seems like, as you said now-</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Even the Metal Gear Solid VR missions. And I think it was Metal Gear Solid 2. It was all these simulated missions that were, quote unquote, in VR.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But even now, as you said, there&#8217;s been this perfect storm of I guess the pandemic and the technology becoming at a enough of a consumer price point where it&#8217;s starting to become commonplace now.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Yep. Hundred percent.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So with your studio, what does a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t really think there is a typical day. It&#8217;s everything. So, right now we&#8217;ve got multiple VR games in production. One is kind of midway-ish. One is at the tail end and we&#8217;re about to go into certification. We&#8217;re working on a number of augmented reality projects and advertising campaigns and things like that. So, every day is kind of a mishmash of touching base with my team to see where things are at, play testing our products and projects and giving some feedback there, investigating new technology that we might be called to use in a campaign of some sort or an activation, pitching projects that we ultimately want to build and do. It&#8217;s a mishmash. Every day starts early and it goes late, but there&#8217;s really no set formula, just whatever we get time to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now we&#8217;re talking about VR virtual reality, which again I&#8217;m pretty sure most of the audience knows about. But I also just kind of want to level set the conversation because there&#8217;s a lot of terms when we talk about these immersive experiences that get thrown around, like AR, XR, the metaverse. Can you give us a couple of definitions of terms that are widely used in this space?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Yeah. The three that I use are AR, VR, and regrettably metaverse because those are three biggest ones. XR I throw out the window because that just opens up its own can of worms. So, augmented reality is basically digital information overlaid on top of the physical world. So, whether that&#8217;s virtual screens that exist in your room, virtual pets that exist in your space and navigate your space that you interact with, things like that. Virtual reality is an entirely virtual space. So, you put on a headset. There is no pass through. You&#8217;re not seeing the real world. You are immersed in a fully virtual world with virtual interactions and virtual environments.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And then we&#8217;ve got metaverse, which is basically a think ready player one basically networked experiences with other people in a virtual space. Doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be in VR. You could make a case that Fortnite is a metaverse of its own with the way that people are able to express themselves with various designs and skins and way you can customize yourself. And you&#8217;re communicating with people and you have shared tasks and goals or you can just hang out remotely together. I think that&#8217;s the perfect example of a metaverse. And so those are really the three that I try and stick to because otherwise you get way too in the weeds with all the different terminology and you lose people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Why do you regrettably say metaverse?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Ever since Zuckerberg changed the company&#8217;s name, Facebook&#8217;s name to Meta, everyone&#8217;s been jumping on the metaverse bandwagon. I think in some ways it&#8217;s good that we have a shared language finally because if you&#8217;ve been working in this space for years, the terminology got pretty hardcore. You had AR, you had VR, you have XR. And then there&#8217;s a whole debate online as to what the hell XR even stands for and where the origins of it come from. That&#8217;s literally a Twitter battle every other day. And then we&#8217;ve got spatial computing, which Magically tried to use to differentiate themselves. And we have Microsoft with Mixed Reality.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And so there&#8217;s all these terms and everyone has their own branded version of the same thing, which made having that common language difficult. So, here&#8217;s Zuckerberg blowing $10 billion a year, whatever to make the dream happening. Renames the company Meta in the spirit of the metaverse. And so everyone now is using metaverse for everything. But I just think if you&#8217;re building this content, you&#8217;re building real time content with networked interactions and expressiveness and personalization, all of things like that. Now we have everyone saying that Web 3 projects are all the metaverse. You buy an NFT and it&#8217;s for the metaverse, even though you can&#8217;t use that content anywhere else. I saw an article the other day about an audio metaverse and it&#8217;s like-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh God.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Everyone is just&#8230; If you do a Google search every day, it&#8217;s just nothing but metaverse this metaverse that. And most of it&#8217;s bullshit. If people are selling you stuff that will be used in the metaverse, 99% of it can&#8217;t be used anywhere because there&#8217;s no interoperability with any of the platforms. So it&#8217;s kind of disingenuous I find when people use the term metaverse. I think it&#8217;s great because it grounds the conversation to a degree. And if anyone with real understanding will know that we&#8217;re talking about networked multi-user experiences that are digital. But for the most part, I think it&#8217;s become a bit of a hype train thing and I&#8217;m waiting for it to die off again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like Meta, Facebook, whatever, they muddied the waters a bit by calling what they&#8217;re doing the metaverse because right after that, everyone of course is asking, &#8220;Well, what is the metaverse?&#8221; But they&#8217;re associating the metaverse with Meta and think that everything metaverse related has to do with Meta the company.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s true. But I was watching an interview this morning on the Breakfast Club with Charlemagne, and DJ Envy, and Angel Yee. And they had a Ja Rule on there and he was talking about how he&#8217;s building a Madison Square Garden for the metaverse. And I&#8217;m like, dude, what now? And so then he said two things later, he had said that he was building inside of the platform called the Sandbox, which is a crypto platform. But one Web 3 real time product isn&#8217;t the metaverse. He needs a certain level of interoperability between the different platforms and we need to be able to jump to and from them easily before I would ever consider it to be the metaverse. But it&#8217;s common parlance now. It&#8217;s to the point where 46 year old rappers are dropping the metaverse now in interviews.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. It&#8217;s funny. At work where I&#8217;m at now, we just released a print magazine and our next issue that we&#8217;re doing the theme for it is Web 3. It&#8217;s geared towards product communities. And so I&#8217;m trying to find what that intersection is going to be between Web 3 and product communities and stuff. But we were initially going to call it metaverse because of that kind of large encompassing, I guess, general definition of it as so many people jump on the bandwagon. But I think narrowing it to Web 3 hopefully will help with that. But I wanted to get those definitions because I think that along with NFTs and DAOs and all that stuff gets thrown in together and people just get confused and I almost feel like that&#8217;s on purpose.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Yeah. I think the running joke right now is if you want to raise a bunch of money, maybe not right now because things are on a downturn, but certainly a couple months ago, if you wanted to raise money, you just say Web 3, metaverse, and DAO and a pitch deck and all of a sudden you&#8217;re valued at $50 million. And I was even thinking about doing some stuff in the crypto space and I talked to a couple investors. And honestly, dude, I didn&#8217;t have anything solid. It was pretty shaky. The idea that I had and the investors were like, &#8220;Yeah, your company, if you started right now, it&#8217;s valued at $25 million. I can help you raise $5 million tomorrow.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Say what? Dude, I don&#8217;t even have a deck. I don&#8217;t have a company. What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
I felt a little bit dirty having those conversations. I&#8217;m like, you know what, I&#8217;m just going to keep on doing this VR AR thing for a minute and just ride this out. But that was the thing. You throw enough of those terms around in a deck and you got a really big valuation and chances are Andreessen Horowitz is going to jump in and value it at a billion dollars, which is those things that was happening. So, it&#8217;s interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, I was going to ask this question. I&#8217;ll still ask it, but I can&#8217;t help but notice in your profile picture you have these Snapchat, AR Spectacles. And that&#8217;s one way that people can experience these immersive experiences. You also mentioned Meta Quest 2. Are there other ways that people can start to get a sense of what these immersive experiences are about?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Yeah. So in the case of the spectacles, those are very much developer only or creator only, as Snap&#8217;s terminology would be. So, there&#8217;s only a handful of people in the world, maybe 600-700 people in the world that have Spectacles right now. They&#8217;re early. They&#8217;re very cool. I love using them, but they&#8217;re really for us to figure out what the capabilities in a lightweight headset need to be for augmented reality to be real and to go mainstream. So, there&#8217;s a lot of dialogue between people like myself and Snap to eek out the most performance and have an understanding of how we want to use these things in the first place. I think in the coming years they&#8217;ll hit mainstream and you&#8217;ll be able to buy them. But right now those glasses are very much for developers to spell out what the future is going to be like.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
In terms of what can you use today to get a sense of what all the stuff is going to be like, Snapchat is huge when it comes to AR. There&#8217;s hundreds of millions of active users right now using AR multiple times a day. So, a lot of the marketing projects that my team engages on are all Snap based just because they have a high number of users, the retention is really high, and people just love using the platform. And so my team has built projects for Direct TV and AT&#038;T and Google and probably some others that I can&#8217;t even think of right now all on Snap.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And typically when we get a request for breaking down the project, it always starts off with, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to target every platform. We&#8217;re going to do Spark AR and we&#8217;re going to do Web AR so you can hit the stuff in a web browser. And we&#8217;re going to do Snap and maybe even a dedicated app.&#8221; And two weeks into any of these processes, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;We&#8217;re just going to go to use Snap because they have the highest amount of users, the highest amount of retention, and the capabilities of the platform are dope. So, I think if you want to experience AR right now, Snap is probably the way to go on your phone.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And if you want to experience virtual reality, Meta Quest 2 is basically the best headset you can get, best platform you can get. It&#8217;s a few hundred bucks. You can go to Amazon or Best Buy and pick them up and bring them home. And it&#8217;s honestly the best experience that you can get right now all in one standalone headset. You don&#8217;t need a computer, which I think VR was really held back for a while by the fact that you needed a gaming computer for the longest time to be able to drive these things. And so here we have a standalone device that&#8217;s basically Android phone on your face. And you get really compelling content. You get, if you want to work on your fitness, you got Supernatural, which is probably the best workout app ever. And I&#8217;m really into it for the boxing. We&#8217;ve got, if you&#8217;re into shooters, they&#8217;ve remade Resident Evil 4 in VR and it&#8217;s only available on the Quest and it&#8217;s probably the best VR game I&#8217;ve played next to Half-Life: Alyx.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And so you&#8217;ve got all these games that are being able to run in a standalone form factor. And then if you want some of those PC only experiences, then you can connect with a cable or even wirelessly to your PC and have it be a PC headset as well. So I think if you want to get into AR, it&#8217;s going to be Snapchat on your phone for the time being. And if you wanted to get into VR, then it&#8217;s going to be Meta Quest. And even with the Quest, they&#8217;re enabling augmented reality and mixed reality experiences now, too. It&#8217;s black and white pass through, but all your content is color. It&#8217;s really compelling. It&#8217;s really compelling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. I have a client that bought me, well, actually I had requested him to get me a Meta Quest 2 instead of paying me a deposit, it&#8217;s still in my closet. I haven&#8217;t broken it out yet. I need to give a spin.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Yeah. Well if you open it up, which you need to, we can play together and you can add me and I will onboard you. That&#8217;s a promise.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, you mentioned-</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
[crosstalk 00:19:12].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. You mentioned these earlier clients that you&#8217;ve worked with. You said Snap, you mentioned just for some of the others I&#8217;m looking at your website here, Uber, Sony, Drake, Beyonce. When you&#8217;re working with these brands, are you seeing any specific trends when it comes to the type of immersive experiences they want to create?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Early days VR was very much driven by hype. So, you basically wanted to have a very basic project. Keep in mind the capabilities when this wave of VR was popping off a few years ago, five years ago, the capabilities weren&#8217;t really as fleshed out as they are now. So it was basically you could look around in a headset. If you were lucky, you had motion track controllers. But you&#8217;re still tethered to a PC that wasn&#8217;t very powerful, especially when it was driving a stereoscopic two views at 90 frames per second. So, you were.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Limited in what you could do. And early days it was basically let&#8217;s build this thing, attach a celeb or a big brand to it, and get press. And so basically you were building projects just to get press because there really was no market to make money. So, you were getting paid to build the experiences and your metric was how many views and how many articles did you get? And I think that did a lot of harm to the industry because weren&#8217;t creating anything really of value that stood the test of time. People weren&#8217;t getting much utility out of it and it hurt the space. And that&#8217;s why when I say I&#8217;m one of the lucky ones that&#8217;s still around, I mean 90% of my peers have died off in this industry to go to adjacent industries or something completely different because there just was no way to make money in VR for the longest time until the last couple years with the advent of the Quest and Quest 2.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
So, I think now we&#8217;re at a point where we have enough data and we have enough users that we can make a go of this, if you do it right, and really create value for people, whether it&#8217;s through an entertaining experience, like a game, or something that provides utility, like a workout app that actually helps people with fitness. Maybe it&#8217;s a meditation app that helps with people&#8217;s personal wellness and that sort of thing. So, I think we&#8217;re at a point now where we&#8217;re trying to identify what are the opportunities to create value for people? As opposed to what&#8217;s this flashy headline that I can get with a celeb or a big brand attached just for shits and giggles? And it&#8217;s a very different way of working. That&#8217;s why I pitch a lot of projects because I don&#8217;t necessarily have all these clients coming to me. But it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, I see an opportunity because I&#8217;m working with the platform. I have some insight as to the numbers or percentage splits of who&#8217;s engaged in what kind of content. And I see an opportunity here if we do it right.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And I think that&#8217;s the key thing is doing it right because you don&#8217;t want shovelware. You don&#8217;t want to announce something that never gets out the door and you ultimately don&#8217;t want to fail the platform. As much shit as they take, Meta&#8217;s done a really great job in building a platform that succeeds for the developers and that you know that if you manage to get to that store and they push you in front of their audience, you&#8217;ll live to fight another day. You won&#8217;t have to close up shop, you can pay your mortgage, everything is good.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And I think part of that responsibility is creating content that stands the test of time, that shows up and does well for its audience. And ultimately, I say this every time we take on a project, we got to come correct. I don&#8217;t want to build a thing that we ship on day one and we forget about it. I don&#8217;t want to ship something that people forget about. It&#8217;s like come correct, create value for the platform, create value for the users, and then identify the next opportunity, and rinse and repeat. But the key thing is to come correct.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m glad that you mentioned shovelware because first of all, that immediately took my mind back to late &#8217;90s, early 2000s when companies were just starting to get on the internet. And they were making just trash just to say that they had some sort of presence, like Pepsi world or something like that. Where you go and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, you can view our latest commercial.&#8221; Why would I want to view a commercial? It wasn&#8217;t any sort of intent behind it, I guess, outside of it being just another commercial, another ad. But I think that was also because brands then, this was such a new technology and a new space, they didn&#8217;t know how to operate within it. I would imagine now with the metaverse, maybe companies are a little smarter about the type of experiences that they want to have, maybe, possibly, not really.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t want to anyone under the bus, but no. There&#8217;s group chats with people and we see the latest headlines every now and then from the Verge or Engadget and we trade it around. We say, &#8220;Why does this even exist?&#8221; There&#8217;s a lot of that going around still. That&#8217;s kind of the nature of the beast to a degree. You got these huge multi-billion dollar companies that are trying to create platforms and they want some big names attached and the people that have access to those big names. It&#8217;s the traditional agency model in a lot of ways where agencies aren&#8217;t really run by creative people. There&#8217;s a million levels of abstraction involved and everyone takes a meeting on every little thing and it&#8217;s designed by committee and none of it is breathtaking. None of it is new. None of it&#8217;s innovative. And the end product hurts.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
So, I think a lot of these projects and products that come out that are associated with a big agency and a big brand, you can probably guess that it&#8217;s not going to be the greatest thing ever. But if you have a really small, nimble team, that&#8217;s dope at what they do and they&#8217;ve studied the space and they&#8217;ve worked at it, they&#8217;ve put in those hours, and they get a hold of something valuable, like a brand or IP, then they&#8217;re going to knock it out of the park. That&#8217;s been the game with everything from the internet to we saw what happened in last year with the NFTs and Web 3 and all this stuff. Did we really need a Matrix Avatar project that&#8217;s basically just a rebranded version of Unreal&#8217;s Meta Humans? No, I don&#8217;t think we needed that. So I think, VR, AR none of it&#8217;s really all that different. I think you just need the indies kind of lay the groundwork for everyone else to follow. And you just make sure that the indies get their flowers and they get their paycheck so they can live another day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That makes a lot of sense. That makes a lot of sense because what you are seeing are a lot of small studios and independent developers trying to stake their claim. And now the larger brands are kind of trying to rush in. And now that they see that, oh, this is something that I think we can be a part of in some way, now they want to try to rush in and get a piece of it. So, that makes sense. But some of these considerations you&#8217;re talking about, there&#8217;s so much to think about with, quote unquote, the metaverse there&#8217;s virtual wellbeing, there&#8217;s economics around NFTs and stuff, there&#8217;s intellectual property. How do you factor in these other types of considerations within your work? Do you think about that stuff?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
No, I try and limit the scope of what I do to exclude all that or else I wouldn&#8217;t get anything done all day. Our business right now on the games front, we&#8217;ve got a couple original games that we&#8217;re working on and we&#8217;ve become the master&#8217;s of porting games. So, we have access to the IP. We don&#8217;t have to worry about any of that. So, we&#8217;re in a good spot there. And then when it comes to the agency side, obviously we&#8217;re working with the brands and agencies. So IP again, isn&#8217;t really a concern for us because they&#8217;re coming to us and saying, &#8220;Use our name and do this thing.&#8221; So, I think the way I&#8217;ve tackled this, we kind of get around all of that. I don&#8217;t think I have, as well as the studio&#8217;s doing, I don&#8217;t think I have enough dollars for all the lawyers that would be involved with everything you&#8217;re mentioning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That makes sense. Let the big companies sort that out. That&#8217;s what they&#8217;re paying for, right?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I love that you&#8217;ve got this portion on your site with rejected projects. Why did you decide to show those?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Yeah, so it&#8217;s weird, man. So, a lot of what people do when they&#8217;re indie is build products and projects and prototype things. But if you take a look at their portfolios, they only have the finished projects, the sexy ones, the ones that shipped. And you never know about what happened in those three months or four months between them shipping stuff. You never know what the backstory is. You don&#8217;t know the genesis of so many of these things. And I found myself for a while not shipping projects and doing a lot of prototyping and having a lot of discussions. And I just wanted an avenue to show it off and put it up as in a way that&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, this is not final. It&#8217;s not shipping. It&#8217;s not representing anyone. But these are the things that we&#8217;re thinking about. These are the conversations that we&#8217;re having behind closed doors.&#8221; The people that we&#8217;re talking to are probably people that you would want to want a product from or at least the conversation with to figure out what this would look like.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And ultimately I just said one day, &#8220;Fuck it. I&#8217;m just going to post all of this stuff sitting on all of these decks and all of these ideas and all these email threads and conversations that I&#8217;ve had. Why shouldn&#8217;t people know about it? They&#8217;re not secret.&#8221; I did the work to come up with the idea and get it in front of the right people and pitch them. So, maybe people should know that I&#8217;m not just kind of sitting around playing Fortnite all day, but I&#8217;m not shipping stuff, but I&#8217;m actually trying to get things done. I&#8217;m trying to build alignment behind the scenes with big brands and stuff. And so just kind of decided one day I got enough material, let&#8217;s do it.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And to be fair, I&#8217;m probably showing only a 10th of the rejected pitches that are pretty decent. Just a matter of I need to find the time to throw all that stuff up. So I think we&#8217;ve got, what do we have in there, dude? We&#8217;ve got some People stuff. We&#8217;ve got Title and RocNation who I was talking to for a while about doing some stuff. I think we got Dead Menace in there. So, there&#8217;s enough cool ideas and content in there that it just kind of made sense to put it out there and say, &#8220;Hey, yeah, I know all these people.&#8221; And if we have something strong, I can take an idea back to them as well. And maybe we&#8217;ll do something in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s probably also just a learning experience, hopefully, for people that are like, &#8220;Oh, we just got pitched on a similar project. Maybe we don&#8217;t do it this way, or something like that. So it&#8217;s kind of a learning tool.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Yeah. A hundred percent</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now as these immersive technologies become more readily available, now we&#8217;ve got, like you said, Snap Spectacles, we got Meta Quest 2. I&#8217;m sure there are going to be more peripherals that come down the line in the years to come. What do you think is going to set each experience apart as these technologies become more readily available?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
I think part of it is understanding the tech and how to make it work and understand the limitations and polish everything that you do. Like I said before, you got to come correct. So when we&#8217;re creating these different experiences, some of them are games and some of them are applications, mixed reality applications that add a layer of utility on top of your physical space, your home or whatever. I think user experience is really important. Onboarding users that have never touched a headset before is really important. Letting them feel comfortable and getting them to a point of comfort where they can share with their friends, &#8220;Hey, put on this headset and try this thing out.&#8221; We need to stop getting away from these high end technologies because this kind of tinkerer space or this hardcore technology space and realize that it&#8217;s for everyone. So I think polish and onboarding and taking the ego out of it is really important to grow that adoption.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now we&#8217;ve talked a lot about your work. We&#8217;ve talked for the past 30 minutes about your work. Let&#8217;s kind of switch back to the real world. Let&#8217;s learn more about Andre Elijah, the person, the man. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Yeah. I grew up in Toronto, middle class family, parents working their asses off to give me a future. Initially wanted to be a child actor and got into that for a little bit. And that kind of kicked off my whole film industry thing. So, did a lot of auditions, was in some commercials and couple small movies and that sort of thing growing up. And really loved the energy of being on set really loved being creative with people. So, that I think set the tone for the rest of my career and seeing how people collaborated and worked under really stressful situations on a set to create something really, really dope.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And grew out of that a little bit. Just the auditions were a lot with everything I had going on at school. I had a lot of extracurriculars and bands and drama and all that sort of stuff. Kind of aged out and then there was an opportunity when I was in, I think grade eight, seven or eight to do what was called an options program and I sucked at sports. So, it was basically an opportunity to do more creative things. So on top of doing debate, there was an opportunity to be part of the film club. And that piqued my interest immediately. My first time shooting and editing, it was a&#8230; My first camera that I used was a Canon and GL1 camera, which is a 3CCD or three chip semi-pro camera from Canon. And my first edit suite was I think Final Cut 3 on a Power Mac G4 with mini DV capture deck and external monitors and all that sort of stuff. So I started, they threw me in the deep end and I got to play with the pro stuff first.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
It was probably seven or eight years before I ever touched iMovie. After I started in Final Cut, I found that whole process of shooting projects and editing them and taking them through post production really, really interesting and fascinating. And I picked it up quick. That just kind of became my thing. And I was always a geek and loved playing with computers. So, the fact that I could create the stuff that people would watch and enjoy while geeking out on these really hardcore computers was a dream from true.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
A lot of the older students, I was grade seventh, grade eight and a lot of the older students that were in grade 11, 12 when they graduated, they went off to work in the big leagues. We had some guys that went off to New York and worked on the Sam Raimi Spider-Man films. We had a couple guys go off to work at visual effects houses. We had some that went off to China and worked in documentary films there. And so I guess they all kind of took me under their wing and I got to see life through their eyes for a while and they onboard me to their projects. So, I was this young kid that was getting really shitty duties on their projects, but it was dope. And eventually I got good at editing. So I became an editor, freelance editor while I was still in high school and all that.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
I ended up working with Radio Television Hong Kong. I was editing some of their documentaries and a buddy of mine that I worked with in the corporate world, we were both moonlighting in the film industry. He ended up going to the American Film Institute. He became a directing fellow there and I edited the three short films that got him accepted into the American Film Institute. So, that kind of set me up. And then I worked at my first agency ever I worked at as a video editor initially cutting together demo reels for them and content for their clients. And then they turned me into a flash developer before flash got killed off by Apple, Steve Jobs, and one letter. They turned me more into a dev than anyone else. And let me see what happened when you press a button and something bounces on a screen. They did that. And I think in a big way kind of set me up to where I&#8217;m at now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, you got introduced into tech at a early age, but through media. I think that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Yeah. I really just always love the creative process and being able to geek out to pull that process together. It&#8217;s been a lot of fun. It&#8217;s been a lot of fun. You see a lot of stuff and yeah, I think the common thread in my career though has been being on the cutting edge of technology. So whether it was the film and using janky ass versions of Final Cut Pro on these ridiculously powerful computers. I did a stint at Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. So, I was a systems analyst for them working on some hardcore service stuff. Years later, after film and agency stuff, working in AR and VR, again, cutting edge of technology. So, I think that&#8217;s always been kind of the constant in my life and in my career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now you went to Ryerson University, which I think by the time this interview comes out, people know it&#8217;s now Toronto Metropolitan University. But you majored in fine and studio arts as part of their new media program there.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
That&#8217;s correct.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
It wasn&#8217;t great. I went to Ryerson because the founder of my first agency, he was actually in the first batch of new media graduates at Ryerson. That guy has always been my hero and I love him to death. Shout to Spencer Saunders. I wanted to be like him, so I went to Ryerson and hopped into the new media program over there. And it was very different than when he went to school. I was one of those people, man, I like doing stuff. I don&#8217;t really like the theory of things. I like getting my hands dirty. It just didn&#8217;t click for me, which is fine. Maybe it clicked for some others, but I like getting my hands dirty. I like building stuff. I like doing the work.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
So, sitting in a class and watching someone code on a projector doesn&#8217;t really teach me that much. Hearing about a VHS fine artwork from 20 years prior when we&#8217;re doing stuff online didn&#8217;t really connect with me. It&#8217;s just one of those things. I think that&#8217;s been another constant in my life too. I just like doing, I don&#8217;t really like the instruction. I Just like getting my hands dirty with the code and seeing how things react when I change things around. So, Ryerson wasn&#8217;t really my bag.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
First couple years, I think I was in school full time. And then the last couple years I was working down the street at Canada Pension while I was doing my classes. So, Canada Pension was really cool. They let me slip off to class when I needed to for an hour or two here and then go back to work. So, I start my day early. I&#8217;d end it kind of later in the day, probably five, six o&#8217;clock. And skip out for, instead of taking lunches or whatever, I&#8217;d just go to class. So, at least my last couple years I had real work that I was doing to kind of balance it all out.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
But yeah, go get your degree. That&#8217;s the thing that gives you credibility I guess. But I can honestly say, at this point in my career, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever looked back at Ryerson and been like, wow, they set me up for this or everything that I did there led to this. God, no. It was me just kind of downloading Unreal Engine when they announced Unreal Engine 4 and being able to play with those content examples and build my own stuff that really kind of got me here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s interesting. I have I guess similar experiences to when I was in college. I would imagine that college is still set up this way where your first two years you&#8217;re just slammed with classes because you have to take your humanities and all the general stuff before you can really get into your major. And then once you get into your major, there&#8217;s not so many classes hopefully. So, you have more time just outside of school to do things. My first year at Morehouse I was ready to go. I was like I don&#8217;t know if this is what I want to do. And I stuck it out because eventually I did have part-time jobs. I actually started working in the computer science lab at Morehouse and that&#8217;s how I got into, not necessarily how I got into technology. I was into it before then. But I got to spend so much time in the computer lab teaching myself HTML, basic JavaScript, et cetera, reverse engineering webpages, figuring that stuff out on my own that had nothing to do with what I was actually learning in my major courses.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so I think if I look back at my time, similar to what you&#8217;re saying, I don&#8217;t know if I would really recommend it. I could say, &#8220;Oh, I went to Morehouse.&#8221; And that means something to people in the world. To me, eh, it was okay. It was all right. I got my degree. I got out, no debt. I can say that proudly.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Key part, right? You got out, you survived, you did it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We had our graduation outside. They normally have the graduations outside and it stormed on my graduation, lightning hitting electronics stormed. And I&#8217;m sitting there in my cap and gown drenched because the person next to me had an umbrella and he wouldn&#8217;t let me get under the umbrella because he&#8217;s like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know who you are. Our last names just happened to be together in the alphabet. Get away from me.&#8221; Yeah, I get what you&#8217;re saying.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
At least you went to you graduation though. I skipped mine. So yeah, that tells you everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after Ryerson, you started out as a freelancer. You were working as a production artist. You were doing a lot of post production work. Was that kind of where the education for you really set in, doing the work?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Yeah. But even what I was doing half the time there was no template for, there was no real learning other than doing it. So, I was fortunate enough that I got my hands on the first couple RED cameras that ever landed in Canada. So, for the people that don&#8217;t know-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Yeah. So that was a big deal. But for people who don&#8217;t know, the RED camera was really the first 4K digital camera that film productions could get their hands on. So, it&#8217;s from a company called RED and Peter Jackson was the first director that would create a project with them. And it was a short film that he created specifically for the company. And since then, they basically redefined Hollywood and they&#8217;re kind of the norm now. And if you watch videos from any of the big YouTubers, like MKBHD, or iJustine, or Jonathan Morrison, any of these people, they all have REDs.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And back in the day, REDs used to cost as much as a house. So the guy that went off to be a directing fellow at American Film Institute and someone else that I was working with, they both happened to get REDs at launch because they could spend as much as a house on a camera and they were directors. They didn&#8217;t want to know how these things worked. They didn&#8217;t need to know. So me kind of being the post-production guy and ultimately becoming an onset workflow person, I learned how the camera worked. I learned how to get the footage off the cards, transcode it.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
I could see a camera shooting and know whether or not it was going to die. And in the early days reliability wasn&#8217;t that great. And I just became the guy that knew how these damn things worked. And so I was consulting a lot on RED productions. Known as the RED whisperer because I just knew everything about them. I figured it out on the fly. There was no real support network for these things. No one had them. So, we just had to figure it out by the seat of our pants on a really expensive production on set. And so worked with those cameras for years.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And then that&#8217;s kind of what led into me working with Beyonce. So, we were shooting a commercial, a real estate commercial, completely unrelated in New York City. And on the last day of the shoot, I got a message from the director of the Beyonce project saying we&#8217;ve got 10 REDs on the floor at a place called Off Hollywood and we don&#8217;t know how to set them up. And my partner and I went over there and we got all the cameras on the same firmware version. We set them up so they could do multi-cam shoots. And we got them all up and running at the facility or at the location, which was Roseland Ballroom in New York City, which I think is closed now. And we got those things up and running for four nights and in a day basically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
For a live via satellite, quote unquote, live via satellite segment for the Michael Jackson tribute concert. We got through that shoot and it was the first 10 RED multicam shoot ever. And we did it for Beyonce and that just kind of we hacked that together. It wasn&#8217;t supposed to work and it did. So all of this stuff, it&#8217;s you learn by doing. You learn by throwing yourself into really uncomfortable situations and just saying, &#8220;Fuck it, let&#8217;s just figure it out.&#8221; So, that&#8217;s kind of led me from thing to thing and it hasn&#8217;t failed me yet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you founded a studio back then, Last Step Studios. And based on what I&#8217;ve heard, your current studio evolved out of that over the course of a weekend. How did that happen?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve had multiple studios. I guess, multiple studios under different names. And I keep on using up all the cool names. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s Andre Elijah Immersive now because I just can&#8217;t come up with any more cool names that should be the name of a company. So in that company, I founded it with another student from Ryerson and we wanted to make video games. And on day one we realized, oh, crap, video games are very expensive to make, very expensive. And we don&#8217;t have money because we&#8217;re broke students. And so we pivoted immediately to doing architectural visualization work using real time engines. And so it was initially Unreal Engine.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
The work that we were creating in Unreal, it looked cool, it was realistic looking, and we could change material on couches and on walls and stuff. And that impressed some people, but they ultimately came to us for more traditional rendering work or dollhouse renderings and some static renderings, that sort of thing, because game engines was so new to the real estate market. It didn&#8217;t really get a lot of pickup. Ultimately, I think we wanted to do different things.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
I saw the demo of the HoloLens. I think it was at E3 where they showed off the Minecraft demo in AR. And I thought that was really kind of awe inspiring. And I wanted to try my hand at making something like that. I didn&#8217;t have the computers to do it. I didn&#8217;t have the know how to do it. I just wanted to do it. And at the same time, the Oculus Kickstarter had popped off and VR was trying to find its footing with Palmer at the helm. And there was something new and sexy and crazy about it that I really wanted to be part of. And it just reminded me of the same energy of so many other things that I chased over the years, whether it was doing the post production stuff in Final Cut or I was getting hands on time with the RED.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
It was just kind of new and unexplored and I wanted in. And I saw it. I saw it pretty clearly in my head what it could be. And I just figured I had a chance. So, literally two founders kind of going in different directions and we dissolved the company over a weekend. And by Monday my new company was spun up and I started trying to land that kind of work. And so tried to figure out ways to differentiate myself from everyone else. And I didn&#8217;t really know what to do. And I had never 3D modeled in my life. I was the engine guy, my old co-founder was the modeler.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And I figured, you know what, if I&#8217;m going to do anything, I&#8217;m just going to go build Drake&#8217;s house and see what happens. And so I learned to 3D model and I built out Drake&#8217;s house, which I think was I don&#8217;t remember now. I think it&#8217;s 25,000 square feet or something ridiculous like that, his new house. The floor plans have leaked on the BBC. And so I had the floor plans and I built it out. I made a website for it, sent it out to a couple places, a couple media outlets. It wasn&#8217;t anything&#8230; I didn&#8217;t do a full court press for it or anything.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And all of a sudden everyone picked up this goddamn house and there were stories everywhere. Teen Vogue picked it up and the Verge or Polygon picked it up, everyone. And I got millions of views in record time. And everyone started hitting me up, platforms and technology companies and other brands. And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;What are you going to do with this thing? Can you do product placement in this house? Can we roll it out to our platform?&#8221; Et cetera. And it took on a life of its own for a while there, trying to figure out what it could be.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And that kind of gave me the legitimacy in a weird way. It was a horrible project technically. My computers were really weak, so I couldn&#8217;t render shadows properly. Couldn&#8217;t render post processing. My processors were too weak so I couldn&#8217;t even bake the shadows. It was God awful. But again, you have a big name, like Drake, who he&#8217;s huge now, but he was big then. You take his name and then you add on something crazy like VR and all of a sudden that&#8217;s the perfect combination there for some headlines.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And so from there, I got a bunch of companies and agencies reaching out to me to do some work and then created the first new home sales suite in real estate for Canada off the back of that. And it actually happened to be for Drake&#8217;s agency, the agency that represented him for a bunch of stuff and worked with him for a bunch of stuff. They hit me up to do the first new home sales suite in Canada using VR. And so we rolled that out and prospective home buyers actually went into VR in the sales office and checked out their future homes. And so we rolled those out. And I did some stuff out of Miami. And then all of a sudden I&#8217;m doing VR for real estate. The thing that I was intending to do with my old co-founder I&#8217;m now doing on my own. And from there other companies started reaching, startups started reaching out to me saying, &#8220;Can you prototype ideas of ours? Because we don&#8217;t have the talent in house.&#8221; So, that was a stepping stone.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And then suddenly bigger companies are more amenable to me working on their stuff or they&#8217;re reaching out. Pretty gradual growth until a couple years ago. Epic Games gave me a MegaGrant for an educational project that I&#8217;ve been working on called Innocence in the Fire. And that was the first major co-sign that I ever got. And they were really great. And so as soon as I announced, &#8220;Hey guys, I got an Epic MegaGrant.&#8221; Bam, life went into overdrive and Snap took me in and has been really supportive. And they keep on shining a light on me with different profiles and different features at their conferences and stuff. And then now I&#8217;m working with Meta. I&#8217;m working with some other companies. So, it&#8217;s been, the last couple years have kind of everything&#8217;s gone into overdrive, which I really love and appreciate. But yeah, it took a minute and some craftiness to get in position for that in the first place.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like things really kind of snowballed after that. I think it was Drizzy Manor, that was what you called it, right?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Yep, exactly. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Things kind of just snowballed after that. And now you&#8217;re also on the AR, VR program advisory board at Vancouver Film School. How has that experience been for you in a way entering back into education? Although not as a student this time, of course.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Here, we&#8217;ve got a school that has some really amazing graduates. We&#8217;ve got Neill Blomkamp went there. End of story, Neill Blomkamp, it&#8217;s done, it&#8217;s a lock. We&#8217;ve got this really amazing traditional film school that wants to explore new media and a new platform. And they&#8217;ve really crafted amazing programs and talent to foster that growth. So, initially there was a buddy of mine that was teaching there. He had me just give a guest lecture. The students were really into it. They asked really great questions. And I was honestly impressed because I think certainly myself and my peers weren&#8217;t solid students like they were when we were younger. Just talking to the staff and the program coordinator, I was like, &#8220;Wow, this is legit. And let&#8217;s figure it out.&#8221; They just kept on calling me back to give talks.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And for the project that ended up getting the Epic MegaGrant, we actually used some of the students for their thesis project. We let them build a prototype of the game. The work was really great. And so just in conversations of how do you teach the next wave of people how to get into the space and teach them to prepare for the future. That just kind of became the onboarding to bring me in as advisor for the program. And it&#8217;s been great. They take our ideas seriously. The students that they have are amazing.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
The talent they have teaching, they&#8217;re all practicing professionals. It&#8217;s not those who can&#8217;t teach. It&#8217;s like that&#8217;s not the situation here. They&#8217;re all professionals in the space. They&#8217;re all people I work with in the space doing really dope shit. And so the students are really lucky. I wish all these teachers were at Ryerson when I was there because maybe I&#8217;d take something from it. But no, it&#8217;s been a really great experience working with the school and seeing the impact that it&#8217;s had on these students and seeing where they land after they graduate has been really dope.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;ve been quoted as saying that your biggest goal for the future is to set the standard for interactive and immersive education. Where does the passion for that goal come from?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
I went to private school when I was a kid and the best we had were VHS&#8217;s and DVDs that were horribly boring. And I think that if you&#8217;re paying that much in tuition, maybe there should be a better learning experience there. And I think with the accessibility of the Meta Quest or Snap on your phone, the level of access to content has never been more amazing and higher. And I think that if we, instead of doing shooty, shooty games all the time, we tried to engage people in new concepts and ideas and reinforce learnings, I think we&#8217;d be further along. So, I just think ultimately that if we were to use all these skills to build something dope, maybe the future has a chance, particularly around climate education.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
We keep on putting people into videos of this is a polar bear dying or this is the world on fire and it hasn&#8217;t really made enough of an impact. You just kind of see the trajectory that the world is on. It&#8217;s not great. So, I think that if we were to engage people more and actually show them the effects of their actions in a digital environment or in a simulation, that maybe it&#8217;ll hit different. The study&#8217;s have proven that if you experience things in VR, your retention is way higher. You understand concepts way more clearly in VR. And I think that if we were to use that for some good, maybe the world would be on a better path. So, that&#8217;s just one of my weird altruistic things. But I&#8217;m hoping that by making these games that are mainstream and onboard more users and get more people there, there&#8217;s a viable path to creating really dope immersive content for education. And then maybe we can turn this world around in a decade from now. That&#8217;s the hope anyway.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now your career to date, as you&#8217;ve described it just in this interview, has been extremely prolific. Who are some of the people that have really helped you out over the years, whether there&#8217;s been mentors, peers, anyone?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Everyone, man. I think this whole industry. I would say the immersive industry is more open and friendly and awesome than any other industry I&#8217;ve been part of. I think at the heart of it, we&#8217;re all a bunch of misfits trying to find our way and trying to lock in and create the future that we all want. And so it&#8217;s been ultimately way more collaborative than any other industry I&#8217;ve been part of. So, it doesn&#8217;t really matter if it&#8217;s a major executive at a company that&#8217;s doing immersive stuff or it&#8217;s a lowly developer that specializes in some weird thing. The whole industry has been really collaborative and really cool. And there&#8217;s you basically check your ego at the door. So, to single anyone out would be kind of weird because I&#8217;ve literally gone up to the top execs at Meta, formerly Facebook, and been like, &#8220;Hey, I really want a meeting with so and so.&#8221; And then they send a message and the next day I get a meeting with that person.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
It&#8217;s just one of these things. I think VR and AR, I don&#8217;t think anyone that&#8217;s in it, really in it isn&#8217;t a geek. I think we all identify with each other in really profound ways. And so there&#8217;s a level of humility involved in the industry that&#8217;s been really great. You see inside of industry Slacks and Discord groups and everything. We&#8217;re all sharing information. We&#8217;re all sharing learnings. We&#8217;re all helping refine each other&#8217;s pitches and play testing each other&#8217;s games and applications. And as much as it&#8217;s Andre Elijah Immersive, there&#8217;s a lot of people on my team and there&#8217;s a lot of people not on my team that have helped out and helped to get us where we are now. So, it&#8217;s really one of those things, it takes a village to raise a kid. So, I think we&#8217;re no different</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If there&#8217;s somebody that&#8217;s out there that&#8217;s been listening to this and they want to follow in your footsteps, whether it&#8217;s I would imagine just getting into this world of AR and VR, what advice would you give them?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
I would say just do it. I don&#8217;t want to sound flippant with that, but this is one of those industries where it doesn&#8217;t take a whole lot to be able to get in and start building. When I worked in film years ago, you needed more than a Handycam to have a good looking image. You needed more than just iMovie to have a really solid edit and final delivery. You need the color correcting and all that sort of stuff. And so you have all the software and hardware considerations and all that. With AR and VR, you need a not so powerful computer and a $300 headset and you&#8217;re off to the races. Game engines are free. Unity and Unreal are free. They have lots of example projects and tutorials online that you can follow to find your footing and start building, but you don&#8217;t need a powerful computer because these headsets are all running mobile parts.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
So, you&#8217;re not pushing for photorealism for these projects. So I think for under a grand ultimately you can be set up and you can start building. And so I think that removes a lot of the barriers and a lot of the excuses as to why you can&#8217;t get into it. So, I would say literally just Google some of your favorite games and how to rebuild some of those mechanics. There&#8217;s literally YouTube channels that just show you in Unreal or in Unity how to build mechanics from games that we all play and like. Learning about the interaction systems and how to set up a project and how to compile. This is all stuff that&#8217;s available at your fingertips. So I think more than ever in this industry you want to do it. You can just go ahead and do it. You don&#8217;t need to ask for permission. There&#8217;s no one gate keeping any crazy hardware or software. You can literally just start.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you think you would&#8217;ve went into if you didn&#8217;t get into this field?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
I asked myself that a lot. For a while I wanted to be an entertainment and intellectual property lawyer. And for a while I wanted to be a robotics engineer. And for a while I also wanted to be a professional jazz trumpet player. I played trumpet for a number of years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
It was going to be one of those three things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. So given how fast all of this is progressing, the technology and everything, where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
I&#8217;m going to be shipping a number of games in the next two to three years and then probably go investor. My team members know that I can maintain this pace for a couple more years. They&#8217;re all young. They got a lot longer to go and I want to be the first check in on their companies when they go ahead and do their own thing. And I tell them all the time, &#8220;I need you guys to bang out these games on these projects and we&#8217;re going to do them together. And you&#8217;re going to have them to your name and it&#8217;s going to be great. And then you&#8217;re going to go out and you&#8217;re going to do your own thing and you&#8217;re going to stomp all over me and it&#8217;ll be fun. I just want to be the one to fund you.&#8221; So, I really want to be the ones that open some doors for them once they&#8217;re done with my stuff and just help the next generation I think.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
I think there&#8217;s been this whole thing since early web days, and then you saw the shift to the app store and everything and all these tech companies, there&#8217;s a certain progression. And you need to go get your Tech Crunch articles and your press and go get your venture capital and all this sort of stuff. And I think there&#8217;s other ways to do that. I think if you&#8217;re really good at shipping products and projects that connect with people, there&#8217;s a different way forward. And so I just want to impart my wisdom on these people and I know a lot of people and look at my rejected section, I know a lot of people. So if there&#8217;s a way for me to open some doors and connect some dots for folks, then I think that&#8217;s the position I want to be in a couple years. And not necessarily shipping a project for a brand every month, month and a half and deal with these crazy ass hours. I&#8217;m getting old.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you got kids!</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
And I got kids! I got to watch them grow up and do after school activities with them when they&#8217;re older and stuff. So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
Yeah. My website is www.andreelijah.com. And my Twitter is @andreelijah. So if you want some industry hot takes, that&#8217;s probably the place to go. And then yeah, my website, that&#8217;s where the portfolio lies. And if you want to know the work that we&#8217;ve done or the stuff we pitched and rejected section, it&#8217;s all there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Andre Elijah, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Just hearing this, I don&#8217;t know, almost this whirlwind of activity that you&#8217;ve got going on, not just with what you&#8217;re doing now with the studio, but what you plan to do in the future and really how you&#8217;ve had this passion to do this for such a long time. I think it really points to the fact that while these technologies, VR for instance, have taken a long time to get off the ground, there&#8217;s been this constant steady push by people like you to really push things into the, not just the mainstream, but to the next level to create experiences that in the future we&#8217;ll be talking about for years and years to come. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Andr√© Elijah:</b><br>
I appreciate you, dude. Thanks for having me. It was a lot of fun.</p>
