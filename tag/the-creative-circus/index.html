Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>We have all had to change things up in one way or other over the past few years. But if you&#8217;re like this week&#8217;s return guest, Nakita M. Pope, there&#8217;s power in pivoting! (You might remember her from <a href="/jordan-taylor/" data-wpel-link="internal">my recent talk with Jordan Taylor</a>, or from <a href="/nakita-m-pope-2016/" data-wpel-link="internal">our 2016 interview</a>.)</p>
<p>Our conversation started with catching up on what&#8217;s happened over the past few years, and Nakita spoke about some of her recent projects, including launching a business course and a subscription box turned online community &#8212; <a href="https://bellabossbox.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Bella Boss</a>! We also talked about her work as a design educator, the recent closing of The Creative Circus, being awarded as an AIGA Fellow, and she shared how her passion projects have impacted her career. Nakita&#8217;s love for community and giving back really shines, and I think you&#8217;ll get really inspired by this interview!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Hi, I&#8217;m Nakita Pope. I am a designer, creative director, studio owner, and professor. I&#8217;m the chief chick at Branding Chicks, which is a boutique branding agency here in Atlanta, Georgia. And I specialize in brand strategy and brand development for women owned businesses and femme focused brands.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s the year been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, man, the year has been a little bit of a whirlwind. I was just talking to someone the other day and telling them that during the pandemic, everybody, well, a lot of people kind of slowed down. Everything got a little bit slower. The pace wasn&#8217;t as rigorous. For me, everything sped up a little bit. It was super busy. And so I feel like 2022 has been about wrapping up that kind of frenzied level of work and of coming back to center a little bit. So it&#8217;s been some ups and downs, but it&#8217;s been a good year. I can&#8217;t complain. It&#8217;s been a great year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything in particular that you want to try to accomplish this year, before the end of the year?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, man, get some rest. That is my goal by the end of this year. I am wrapping up some things right now, and that&#8217;s my goal is to take this last quarter of the year, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;ll be the whole quarter, but I definitely want to take some time at the end of this year to just sort of recenter myself and get some rest.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always doing so many things at once. I kind of like it that way, as a creative, it keeps me from being bored. But I&#8217;m starting to realize that it&#8217;s been a very long time since I stopped everything. And so I&#8217;m looking forward to taking some space to do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Good. Definitely, take that space now before, say, oh, I guess before the winter really starts. But it kind of feels like any time between Thanksgiving and New Years is sort of a down period for everybody. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; hopefully, you&#8217;ll get a chance to get some of that rest. I think we all probably need that.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah, indeed. Indeed, more than we think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Let&#8217;s talk about Branding Chicks. Now, you&#8217;ve been in business now for what, over 12 years, now, right?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s been a while. It went by so fast. That sounds crazy, 12 years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has your business changed since we last talked? That was back in 2016. How has your business changed?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
It&#8217;s changed quite a bit. A lot of it has stayed the same, but so much of it has changed. I think part of what has changed&#8230; Well, I&#8217;ll start with something that&#8217;s stayed the same. So one of the things that stayed the same is I kind of always worked remotely, because I have sort of a niche sort of brand. I feel like I end up working with people all over. And so it&#8217;s not specific to Atlanta, necessarily. And so that was always kind of how I worked. But now since the pandemic and all that stuff, I find that it&#8217;s expanding even more, because other people are now looking outside of their geographic locations even more.</p>
<p>And understanding that they can do really robust and deep work with people, even if they&#8217;re not necessarily in the same place or able to meet face to face. So I feel like that has both stayed the same and also changed. I feel that I&#8217;ve also been able to work with some amazing organizations that are doing really great work that I feel really strongly about, personally. I&#8217;ve been able to do some deeper dives with some brands, and do some larger projects with some of those brands. And to me that&#8217;s growth, to allow me to do more of what I want to be doing, and more of where I feel that I can have the best impact. That&#8217;s how I measure success. So in that space, I&#8217;m really happy with the direction that things are going in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you seen a change in the market with respect to the things clients are looking for? Have things shifted or changed during the pandemic?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. I think some of it, from a brand strategy standpoint, I&#8217;m noticing more and more that organizations and companies are starting to understand that even if they were already committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion, they are looking to build that and bake that into their brands a bit more. Which I love to see, because that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m passionate about as well. And I know that in some cases we see companies doing that, and we&#8217;re not sure if it&#8217;s going to stick.</p>
<p>But from my perspective, when I see companies that come to me for that and they are looking at the foundational parts of their brand and their brand personality and their core values and things like that, if they&#8217;re baking it into those things, then I find that they are more deeply passionate about it and more committed to it. So I see a lot of that happening on my end, which, like I said, I&#8217;m really happy to see. And it allows me to work in some of those spaces that I work in outside of my business, also, in my business. So it gives me a chance to bring some of that knowledge in, and also, help people build brands that they feel like really represents them in every way. So I see a lot of that shifting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you first see that shift? I&#8217;m curious.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I think 2020. I think when George Floyd happened, and so much of the conversation got so much louder. A lot of us have been talking about this for a long time, working in this space for a long time, both at the front lines and behind the scenes trying to make some of these things happen. But I think overarchingly after the nationwide, worldwide conversation got so much louder, I think that some of these companies are realizing that they need to change their ways. And/or if they were already committed to it, then they need to be even more vocal about their commitment. So I feel like that was the catalyst for a lot of it, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does a typical day look like for you now?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, man, it&#8217;s all over the place. Most days I am working on client work. Two days a week, I&#8217;m usually teaching as a professor. But other than that, some days I&#8217;m also consulting or I might have a public speaking engagement or doing things like this, doing a podcast interview. So it really varies quite a bit from day-to-day. But I kind of like that, it keeps me from being bored, and it gives me a chance to dive deeper into the things that I care about and the spaces that I work in a lot of different ways. It&#8217;s all connected. It doesn&#8217;t feel disjointed to me. It&#8217;s all connected in some way, but it gives me a chance to touch it in different ways.</p>
<p>And they all feed each other. So all the things that I learned with my client engagements brings me into the consulting with other clients. All of those experiences I can bring to my students, and give them a more robust education about how we work with clients and things that I&#8217;m working on, and what the industry looks like and all that stuff. And when I&#8217;m doing industry stuff, then I learn some other things and then bring it back to some of those other things. So I feel like it&#8217;s all connected, but it does allow me to have a different day, every day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious, has the pandemic changed business for you in any way? I know we talked about sort of have you seen a change in the market, but since the pandemic has started, has that shifted how you do business?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Not particularly, to be honest. I think just in terms of my processes and my creative process and stuff, that hasn&#8217;t changed very much. Like I said, I think more people are willing to work remotely. So that&#8217;s changed a little bit of the opportunities that I&#8217;ve been getting and people that are reaching out to work with me. I think from a logistical standpoint, I think more people want to be on video these days.</p>
<p>Like I said, I&#8217;ve worked with people all over the country for a while now, and most times people were completely fine with just a phone call. But now that everybody&#8217;s kind of been forced to work remotely, I think that video calls are now the go-to instead of the phone call. So from a logistical standpoint, that is something that I&#8217;ve seen that&#8217;s changed. Which I don&#8217;t mind most times, but it is definitely interesting to see a shift in that. But then I saw the uptick in it and then I saw the fatigue that came from it.</p>
<p>So now I&#8217;ve gone back to giving people a choice, &#8220;Listen, you don&#8217;t have to be on video if you don&#8217;t want to. Let me know what works best for you. I don&#8217;t want to make it more uncomfortable for you or make it more of a heavy lift to have this meeting.&#8221; So I try to be respectful of that too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I say that also when I have meetings, I actually have two separate booking links, one is for phone, one is for Zoom. And I&#8217;ll only give the Zoom to people that I like. People that I want to see, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You can get the Zoom call.&#8221; If you just hit me up out the blue and want something, a phone call is fine. It&#8217;s the same information. So I get what you&#8217;re saying though about having that option though. Because even I think with the fact that everybody&#8217;s getting on video, folks still have not really gotten used to it. We&#8217;re-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; what, two something years in and people are still like, &#8220;Oh, sorry about the background,&#8221; or the lighting is bad or whatever. And I&#8217;m not expecting studio quality video here-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
No, right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; even though we are very much in the future. I&#8217;m not expecting that. But I don&#8217;t know, sometimes it&#8217;s different. Plus, there&#8217;s all these different video platforms. There&#8217;s Zoom, there&#8217;s Google Meet, there&#8217;s WebEx. What else do I have installed? I have BlueJeans. I have Teams. I&#8217;m like, Just pick up the phone.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
It&#8217;s too much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right, just pick up the phone. It&#8217;s the same information. It&#8217;s the same information.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I&#8217;m going to have to steal that one. I might have two separate links too, now. Because mine was already set up, just the default was phone. And then I realized that all the instructions said, &#8220;I will give you a call at that time,&#8221; after they book. But I still get emails, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t ever see a link to a video call.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;That&#8217;s because it wasn&#8217;t really supposed to be one.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see a link.&#8221; Or sometimes what&#8217;ll happen with people is they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Oh, well I&#8217;m in the car going somewhere and I&#8217;m not going to be&#8230;&#8221; Just call me. Just call me.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
It really is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The phone still works. It did not go away in the pandemic. It still works. I see that one thing that you&#8217;re offering now is a course. You&#8217;re offering a course called Building a Business Brand. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
That was something that I did in collaboration with Small Business Invoicing Company. And they were looking to just build a library of resources for their small business audience. And so I was able to do that with them and it was really great. It was a series. I think there were three modules. But we just talked about the benefits and the value of being able to build a brand for your business. Whether you&#8217;re creative or not, regardless of what type of business you have, I think most of us start a business because we&#8217;re really passionate about what it is that we do. We&#8217;re passionate about whatever that skill set is, whatever product or service that we are putting out there in the world. And so that tends to be for most people where your area of expertise is.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re necessarily an expert at being able to brand yourself or market yourself. Even creatives that are in these spaces every day struggle with that, because it&#8217;s hard to figure out what your personal brand is or your business brand is. Sometimes it takes having some help from outside. But we just talked about the fundamentals of that, and how much of a difference it can make to distinguish you in your category.</p>
<p>I hear all the time where some people are getting ready to start new businesses or they come to me and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;I&#8217;m starting a business that&#8217;s this, fill in the blank. And people are telling me that I shouldn&#8217;t start a business in this, because it&#8217;s oversaturated and there&#8217;s already so many people doing that thing.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s really where branding comes in. The fact that you can establish a personality or some value-add or some way of talking about your product or service that&#8217;s different from everybody else is what&#8217;s going to stand out.&#8221; So it was really kind of built around that and it was super fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you thought about expanding into doing other courses?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, for sure. I&#8217;ve done lots of workshops here and there before, both under the umbrella of other organizations, and some independent ones on my own. And I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;m going to tackle this, because like I said, I&#8217;m trying to take a little bit of a break, but I&#8217;m looking at, one of the things that I see is that, for me, I really care so much about what it is that I do. And teaching is something that&#8217;s really close to my heart.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m always looking like, what do people need? What is it that people are struggling with? Or where can I have the most impact? And one of the things I see, especially for designers is that, and not just designers, actually people that are in marketing, for instance, some people who have design backgrounds or even people that are in coming from sales, often I hear people, &#8220;I want to talk about brand strategy. I want to get into that, but I have no idea how to make that transition.&#8221;</p>
<p>And for designers, especially going from strictly the visual identity and the creative side of things to talking heavily about strategy sometimes is a challenge. And it&#8217;s not because they&#8217;re not already doing it. Because that was my situation, in retrospect, I realized that I was always a strategic designer. That was always a big part of my process. But I didn&#8217;t necessarily put it out there. I didn&#8217;t explain all of my process to my clients necessarily. I didn&#8217;t build it into my proposals. It just wasn&#8217;t at the forefront. But it was there underneath all the time. Before I designed anything, I did all the research. I looked at their competitors, I did all these things. But I realized that for most designers, it&#8217;s hard to make that transition, because they don&#8217;t know how to reposition themselves in the market in that way.</p>
<p>And they don&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know. They don&#8217;t know what they need to know to be able to take those parts that they may already be doing, and be able to go deeper with that and really make it a big part of their practice. And because that&#8217;s part of the process that I really love, I&#8217;ve always been looking at how can I do more of this? And then of course at some point I had that fork in the road, where I had to decide, am I going to position myself in this way? Or am I just going to make this a bigger part of my design process?</p>
<p>And so when I started Branding Chicks, that was the pivot for me to decide that I was going to make brand strategies the thing that I led with. And I still do a lot of design for my clients, but I also am now in a place where, probably, about half of my clients, I&#8217;m only doing strategy for, I&#8217;m not necessarily creating any deliverables on the design side. So it&#8217;s kind of the best of both worlds.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I feel like we&#8217;ve started to see designers probably over the past maybe four or five years, start to lean more into that strategy. Because it&#8217;s been pushed a lot to say-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; &#8220;Yes, you can know how to do design, you can know the programs and the tools and the methods, but until you&#8217;re able to apply that in a business sense, then that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ll become truly effective.&#8221; Douglas Davis, who we both know, has a whole book about it. So it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re starting to see a lot of designers try to go into. The thing with the courses, though, I&#8217;m really interested about, because I feel like courses are something that, and I&#8217;m dating myself here, I&#8217;m thinking way back to 2010, probably, even a little bit earlier than that, but do you remember CreativeLive? Does that sound familiar to you?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yes, I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
CreativeLive used to do these multi-day courses with entrepreneurs would come in and they would teach. And I mean for the time it was pretty novel. I actually don&#8217;t even know what CreativeLive is doing now. But I know that something that is pushed on a lot of entrepreneurs, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, take the knowledge that put it into a course, and then sell the course.&#8221; Which is always an option, but are your clients going to be the same people that you want to sell your course to? It feels like it opens up a separate revenue stream, potentially. But then unless you&#8217;re just not a great salesman, that&#8217;s skills you have to tap into.</p>
<p>I tried to do courses when I had my studio, and even though I&#8217;ve taught before, I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to sell the course.&#8221; It didn&#8217;t feel right for me to sell the course. And I know that people do, this was actually a little bit before Skillshare, but people would do Skillshare and things like that. I taught at Mediabistro and I sort of did my courses that way. And it was easy because it was just like you had a PowerPoint, you had a microphone, you spoke all through the lessons and stuff like that.<br>
And it works, but it did add on, for me at least, it just added on this extra dimension of sales that I have to do. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;It&#8217;s not worth it. For the money that I&#8217;m getting from it, it&#8217;s not worth it for me trying to hustle on these courses. I&#8217;ll just get some more clients.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah, I totally get that. And I agree with you. I don&#8217;t think that any of the courses that I&#8217;ve done previously or the one that I&#8217;m going to be doing about brand strategy isn&#8217;t really targeted towards clients. It&#8217;s much more targeted to other creative professionals more than anything else. So I look at it as a form of professional development, I mean, because I did the one that you&#8217;re talking about in partnership with someone else, that was meant to be an evergreen course, so it was fully recorded and all that kind of stuff. And so they&#8217;ll have it for a while and their audiences can access it whenever.</p>
<p>The way that I&#8217;m approaching my brand strategy course is I&#8217;m looking at it as sort of a masterclass. I want it to be hands-on and I want it to be small and I want it to be in real time, because I enjoy that part of teaching. And I feel like there&#8217;s so much so to learn, there&#8217;s so much to share, and there&#8217;s so many questions that people always have that this is born out of my day-to-day, and people that ask me these questions or they send me emails and those kind of things. So I&#8217;m looking at how can I help them in real time? I want to answer your question, not a general question like yours. I want to answer your question.</p>
<p>So I feel like, for me, I&#8217;m looking at sort of a masterclass kind of thing more than an evergreen, pre-recorded course. I think there&#8217;s a lot of value in those as well, but I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s what I really want to do. I just like the hands-on so much more, so that&#8217;s the way that I&#8217;m looking at it. Yeah,</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I gotcha. So while we&#8217;re talking about teaching, I have to ask you about The Creative Circus. The Creative Circus is where you&#8217;ve taught for, how long have you been teaching there?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I think this is my 13th year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
13 years. It&#8217;s closing its doors. Jordan Taylor, who I had on a couple of episodes ago, we talked about that. How do you feel about it?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a set of mixed in motions. It really is. Other than some workshops here and there and some guest lectures and things like that, this has been my most continuous experience with teaching and it&#8217;s something that I truly love. So it&#8217;s always going to be something I truly love. I&#8217;ve seen so many talented people come through those doors, and it&#8217;s such an amazing alumni network. And so many people, I&#8217;m still connected to both that are still in the building, people that are graduates, former instructors, and things like that. So it&#8217;s a mixed set of emotions.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited about what my next chapter looks like. I know that frees up some mental and emotional space, and also some time to do some other things. So in some ways I&#8217;m excited about that, but I&#8217;m going to miss that place. I&#8217;m going to miss my students. So it&#8217;s definitely been some emotional times, up and down, over the last six months or so.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at that time, because you not only were there as a teacher, but you were advising, especially along DEI and stuff like that, what feelings in particular come to mind? Are there any sort of memories that you have specifically about your time there?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, so many. I think the things that stand out most to me is, as a teacher, the thing that you want the most is to watch someone&#8217;s light bulb go off. And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, man, I get it now.&#8221; And I&#8217;ve seen that happen over the years in multiple ways. Sometimes it&#8217;s about a course that I&#8217;m teaching, sometimes it&#8217;s about the DEI training that I might be doing, or it might just be those life conversations that I have with my students. I just love connecting with the students more than anything else.</p>
<p>So many of those moments are the ones that I hold close where they trusted me to tell me something about their lives or to ask for advice. I was able to help them with something that really made a difference for them in their professional careers or their academic careers. Those are the things that I&#8217;m going to keep close to my heart, because those are the things that let me know that I was having impact and made it all worth it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you step back and just look at, I guess, Atlanta as, I don&#8217;t know, I guess you could say a design education city, I feel like over, I&#8217;d say maybe the past 20 or so years, I mean, we had Atlanta College of Art, and then that went away. Now, there&#8217;s The Creative Circus that&#8217;s going away. I&#8217;ve heard there&#8217;s been some changes at The Portfolio center, which I think it&#8217;s now just called Miami Ad School, I believe.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Mm-hmm. It is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you feel about just the state of design education in the city? I mean, I feel like we&#8217;ve had these specialized colleges for a while that taught them, and then over the years they&#8217;ve sort of changed and went away in some way.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah, lots of changes over the years. I think some of it&#8230; Well, one of the things, like you said, this is definitely a design education city. When I was on the board with AIGA, I was running the education committee, and we have seven design programs in metro Atlanta. That is unheard of for even most other metropolitan cities. So even the more niche schools that you&#8217;re talking about, there&#8217;s still, Georgia State has design programs, Georgia Tech has design programs, University of Georgia, which we kind of still count. There&#8217;s other schools as well that have designed programs even outside of The Portfolio School, and more specialized schools and things like that.</p>
<p>So it was just such a breadth of education in that space. I think that some of the changes are good. I think some of them are going to have some ripple effects. I think one of the things that has always been a struggle, and I think with the changes in the programs it&#8217;s going to add to it, is that even though so many people have been educated in design here in the city or around the city, they tend to not stay in the community for their professional pursuits.</p>
<p>They get their education in this space and then they move to another place. Which nothing is wrong with that, but that has been part of the challenge is trying to retain that talent here. Because I think sometimes, especially for those students who might move into the city specifically to go to school, they don&#8217;t necessarily always have time while they&#8217;re in school to dive into the creative communities here in a real way. So they only see the little bubble that&#8217;s created for them by their programs. So they don&#8217;t necessarily get a chance to see all that&#8217;s available and what the real Atlanta creative community looks like. So when it&#8217;s time for them to look for a job, they don&#8217;t always consider staying.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like there&#8217;s an ongoing trend in Atlanta about not being able to retain, or I would say appreciate creative talent.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Nope.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Not just in design, I&#8217;m thinking specifically about music, but music, art, design, I feel like that&#8217;s an ongoing thing, where, and I mean we&#8217;re speaking of the city as it&#8217;s a person, but I don&#8217;t know if the city appreciates what it has and what it cultivates here to the point where people would want to stay here. There&#8217;s been several musicians that have blown up elsewhere, but when they were here in Atlanta, nobody would give them a chance. I&#8217;ve certainly had folks on the show who were from Atlanta, and they may have gotten their education here, but they had to go elsewhere to find opportunities or to do big things.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had other Atlanta folks that are, I would say, other educators and other business folks to ask, like, &#8220;Why do you think that&#8217;s the case? What is it about Atlanta that&#8217;s not making these people want to stay? Is it the workforce?&#8221; I would imagine there are other factors, just cost of living and traffic and stuff like that. But I even think about when I was in my 20s, I definitely, at one point. Wanted to leave. I was like, &#8220;I feel like I&#8217;ve hit a ceiling.&#8221; This is well before I started Revision Path. But I was like, &#8220;I feel like I&#8217;ve hit a ceiling in my career. I don&#8217;t know where else I can go from here, unless I move away.&#8221; Maybe that&#8217;s what plays into it. I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I think there&#8217;s a lot of factors. I think some of them, you&#8217;ve already tapped into. The other side of it, my experience is a little different from yours. I came here for grad school. I came here to go to Portfolio Center, which is now Miami Ad School. And I was going to finish my two years and I was going to just leave it open. Where do I end up? I don&#8217;t know. But everything is wide open for me. And so by the time I graduated, I was actually looking at moving to Seattle, but I graduated in the middle of a recession. So I shot my book all over the country, and people are like, &#8220;We love your work, but we&#8217;re on a hiring freeze. We&#8217;re not hiring anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>So that meant that I ended up staying here. I mean, it took me a little longer to find a job and all those things. So I was like, &#8220;Well, I guess I&#8217;ll just stay here for a while.&#8221; And so I ended up getting my first design job here. And I think, honestly, that&#8217;s the best thing that could have happened for me. The other thing I&#8217;m aware of is that my situation also isn&#8217;t everybody else&#8217;s, is that because I&#8217;m independent and I&#8217;ve been independent for so long, I never really went through the process of trying to move up in a creative agency completely.</p>
<p>I worked in agencies. I worked in in-house. I&#8217;ve done a lot of those things, but on the short term, or I did them for a little while. And so I did a lot of that moving around in the beginning. But for the last 12 years, I&#8217;ve worked for myself. And so for all of the things that come along with being an independent creative, and there are many, both positive and negative, I think one of the biggest positives, and I can say this in hindsight now, is that there is no ceiling when you&#8217;re on your own. When you&#8217;re on your own, you create your own path, for better or for worse. You might make some mistakes. Whatever those things look like, you&#8217;re on your own. So I feel like, for me, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d have been able to do all of the things that are available to me now had I stayed in a traditional agency environment for my entire career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
And I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the truth for everyone else. I know other people have taken that path and it&#8217;s worked out extremely well for them. I don&#8217;t know if it would&#8217;ve for me, and it&#8217;s hard for me to know, because I don&#8217;t have the opportunity to do both. I did some in the beginning, and now I&#8217;m here, and I think everybody&#8217;s path is their own.</p>
<p>But I do think about that often. What would that have looked like? And would I have gotten to a place where I was like, okay, like you said, I have to move away if I&#8217;m going to move up, or I have to go do this if I&#8217;m going to move up or whatever those things look like? So I think it&#8217;s different for everybody, but the landscape of what it looks like for different people and what your personal commitments are, and what kind of lifestyle you want to live and all those things really play into whether this is a good fit for you or not.</p>
<p>But on the flip side, I do think that Atlanta is a lot of creatives here. And I do feel like it&#8217;s a very supportive, creative community. So I don&#8217;t know, like you said, if the city itself does everything that it can, but I feel like once you find your people here, I feel like that network is amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I agree. I agree 100%. Once you get into that niche and you find those folks, you find your tribe, your people, whatever you want to call it, there&#8217;s no limit to the things that you can even work on. And to speak to what you said earlier, I did have to leave. I had to leave where I was AT&#038;T, strike out on my own, and then that&#8217;s when I started to really&#8230; Well, first of all, I could never have pictured staying AT&#038;T. There are people who I used to work with back then in 2008 that are still there. God bless them, because it couldn&#8217;t be me, could not be me. I say that to say, though, I mean, everyone has their path, for some folks staying in that very comfortable, crucible of being a production designer, if that&#8217;s what they want to do, that&#8217;s what they want to do.</p>
<p>I just knew that I could do better than where I was at. And this is not a slight on the people that are still there, but I could do better. And I just didn&#8217;t know, when I think about Atlanta in 2008, I mean this is pre SCAD. This is pre a lot of larger tech companies setting up offices in such here.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
True.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
This is pre Uber and Lyft. I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a car. Where am I going to find a good job? I got to catch MARTA somewhere, it&#8217;s wild.&#8221; So now I think the city is definitely different in that aspect. We do attract a lot of people that want to come here for, I think, just creative art stuff in general, not just for maybe design. But over the past 10 years, we&#8217;ve really blown up with television and entertainment.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And that opens up a lot of roles in the creative space. So the environment here has just gotten a lot more rich since then.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Agree. Agree, wholeheartedly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now speaking of the sort of Atlanta community, you mentioned AIGA. I just want to congratulate you on your recent AIGA Fellow Award.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Such a great honor. AIGA, for those of you out there that don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s sort of the national body of professional organization for designers. And so we&#8217;ve got chapters all over the country. The Atlanta chapter has been active for a really long time. And each chapter has the opportunity to award fellow awards to people in their community that they feel have really moved forward the area of design or made impact on the local, regional, and national level.</p>
<p>And I think our chapter has honored 32 people, possibly. No, 16 people. It&#8217;s a very short list, so I was honored for 2021. We just had the celebration a couple months ago, because of the pandemic and everything. But I was given the honor in 2021. So that was a magical moment for me. It gave me an opportunity to really celebrate my community and celebrate all the things that I&#8217;ve been able to do and touch, and people that I&#8217;ve been able to meet in this community. So it was really a great night.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I&#8217;m glad that the community has come around you to recognize all of the great work that you&#8217;ve been doing, and to have their support for you. So that&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yeah, it was a great honor. It was a great honor.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now speaking of other projects, I see that you have this project called the Bella Boss Box. How did you come up with the idea for doing a subscription box?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
So we talked about having your people. I feel like, I don&#8217;t know about you, but my friends are the ones that always get me into stuff, especially my creative friends. They&#8217;re the ones that call you with a bright idea and be like, &#8220;So this is what I&#8217;m thinking.&#8221; So it was kind of similar to that. One of my good friends, Nekeidra Taylor, and actually we met through a client. A client of mine introduced me to her because she was like, &#8220;I think you guys should meet.&#8221; And so this was years ago. And so we&#8217;ve been friends and professional colleagues for a while.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s in public relations. And so during the pandemic, we hadn&#8217;t done our normal check-ins or have coffee here and there, kind of thing. And so we finally had a check-in call, and we were just catching up and talking. And we just ended up talking about our journeys as entrepreneurs and what the pandemic had been like and our support systems and things like that. And the fact that without those support systems, we wouldn&#8217;t have been able to do half of the things that we&#8217;ve been able to do.</p>
<p>And so from that conversation, we started thinking about what must it be like for people, especially women, who are starting businesses or running businesses who don&#8217;t have that support system. I think that I&#8217;ve been lucky, personally, because of my network and people who&#8217;ve introduced me to other people or just friends of mine who I&#8217;ve been friends with for a long time, but who are now also business owners as well. And even if your friends and your family support you in what you&#8217;re doing, and sometimes they won&#8217;t, sometimes they just won&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>But even if they do, if they&#8217;ve never done it before, they still don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s actually like. And so sometimes it helps to have someone that you can pick up the phone and call and ask a question, and feel like it&#8217;s a safe space to ask a question. Or to just vent and be like, &#8220;Look, I&#8217;m about to go work at Popeye&#8217;s.&#8221; That used to be mine when I was really frustrated with being an entrepreneur. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yep, I&#8217;ll just go and work at Popeye&#8217;s. I like chicken. It&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>And you need those people that you can call and say that, and they totally get it. You don&#8217;t have to explain it, you don&#8217;t have to do anything. They&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s that day, huh? Mm-hmm. So what happened?&#8221; And so that&#8217;s kind of how it was born. We talked about it and she&#8217;s like, &#8220;No, I think you should do&#8230;&#8221; We talked about a subscription box. How could we build a community of women that would be able to connect with each other in that way? So we came up with the idea for a subscription box, and I was like, That would be really cool.&#8221; And she&#8217;s like, &#8220;You should definitely do it.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, I should do it. Why, I got to do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>And so she&#8217;s like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time to do it.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not doing it if you&#8217;re not doing it.&#8221; And then next thing I know, we&#8217;re setting up an actual call to talk about it. And that was October 2020. And so we planned this whole thing and launched the whole thing during the pandemic. We launched in April 2021. We hadn&#8217;t seen each other in person until March 2021. So this was all done on Zoom, during the pandemic. Even though she lives here, we were still kind of staying away from everybody and stuff. So it was kind of crazy.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s been awesome. I feel like we&#8217;ve connected with some really amazing women all over the country who have a multitude of different types of businesses and things like that. And then just this summer we decided that we were going to pivot a little bit. The subscription box was going really well. As a designer, it was awesome. It gave me an opportunity to create things specifically for that community. We had a zine. I was designing products for the boxes, and I did all the branding for the boxes themselves, and all that stuff. And she&#8217;s in PR. She did a lot of the writing and things like that. So we really were a good fit to compliment each other.</p>
<p>But this summer we looked at everything and kind of like we tried to have those moments where we stop everything and start working on the business instead of in it. And okay, where are we? And where do we want to be? And we felt like the community part of it wasn&#8217;t getting as much shine as we really wanted. That was why we built this thing in the first place, so we decided to take a break and regroup and relaunch just the community.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re still kind of working on that. We&#8217;re taking a break. She&#8217;s busy. I&#8217;m busy. We both have separate businesses on top of this one. So we&#8217;ve decided to just take a break for a little while, really get grounded in what we want, and then relaunch again. Preferably, we want to do an online community so that we have a chance to provide deeper relationships for the women that are our subscribers. So that&#8217;s what we really want to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So you&#8217;re pivoting from the subscription box to an online community. So just sort taking that notion and deepening it, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yes, exactly. Exactly. Because I think what we heard from our subscribers was that they love the items in the box, and they love so much of that stuff and the magazine and all those things, but they really love the idea of being exposed to other women who were doing amazing things and hearing about people&#8217;s businesses. And we would do this series called Respect on Our Name. So we would do interviews with black women entrepreneurs on Instagram. So people really responded to those kind of things a little bit more than the items in the box. And so much of the stuff in the box was also about providing resources and information. So we felt like we could wrap that all up and also bring the community to a higher level if we pivoted a little bit. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re looking at doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you interviewed me back in 2018 for Design Observer, and during that interview you had asked me how passion projects have impacted my career. Now I want to flip the script and ask you that question. How have your passion projects impacted your career?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Lots of different ways. I think Bella Boss is definitely one of those passion projects. I probably would&#8217;ve done that even if it wasn&#8217;t a business. That&#8217;s just something I&#8217;m passionate about. I&#8217;m passionate about seeing Black women shine and succeed and women in general. And I think running a business has been such an adventure for me in so many ways. And I think that I know what it&#8217;s like even when you have support. I can&#8217;t imagine what it&#8217;s like when you don&#8217;t have support. So I always try to be that support or give people resources wherever I can. So I think Bella Boss is definitely something I would consider to be a passion project.</p>
<p>Mentoring is another passion of mine. Almost everything that I&#8217;ve done has come from something that holds a special place in my heart. Teaching is just more of mentorship for me. So mentorship and teaching are very much tied together. I&#8217;ve done a lot of public speaking, and I used to be terrified of public speaking. But the thing that shifted public speaking for me was looking at it as a bigger classroom. And because I love teaching so much, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, you just get a chance to share knowledge with more people.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I feel like those aspects of my career have come out of the passion of wanting to share with other people. Branding is so much about being creative and solving problems and all those kinds of things. And I think all of those things are core to my personality and core to the things that I care about.</p>
<p>One of the stories that I love the most about when I was a kid is that my mom told me that I used to love puzzles. And so she would buy me all these different puzzles. So because I had so many, I got to a point where I would literally dump all the pieces out in the middle of the floor and solve them all at one time. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s pretty much what I do every day. Mm-hmm. That&#8217;s pretty much the life that I&#8217;ve built for myself.&#8221; So when I think about things like that, I feel like all the things that I care about or that&#8217;s fun for me, or that&#8217;s interesting for me has been the foundation of every single thing that I do every day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How have you built your confidence over the years as a creative professional? I mean, you&#8217;ve been doing this for a very long time. That longevity obviously has to come from somewhere. What fuels you as a creative professional?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I try not to stop learning. As a teacher, I feel like you have to learn all the time. But even outside of that, I think I&#8217;ve always been naturally curious. And so for me, I want to ask more questions. I want to learn more. I want to talk to all the people that know the things that I don&#8217;t know. I want that, that&#8217;s what feeds me. And so I feel like confidence for me comes from knowledge and it comes from experience. And sometimes you have one without the other or vice versa, and then sometimes you have both. And I think over the years, I&#8217;ve just tried to learn as much as I possibly can on a day-to-day basis. And because of the years behind me, now I have the experience as well. But in the beginning, I didn&#8217;t have all the experience. I just had the knowledge and I had the willingness to learn.</p>
<p>And I think, if nothing else, I feel like those are the two things that has allowed me to grow the most and to be willing to take a chance. I can&#8217;t stress that enough. So many of the things that I&#8217;ve been able to do or that I&#8217;ve done that I can look back and be the most proud of are the things that terrified me in the beginning. If it doesn&#8217;t make me want to vomit a little bit when I say yes to it, then it is probably not going to make me grow. And so going back to our previous conversation just about being an independent and how that looks so different for me, I think the flexibility to try a bunch of new things and different things and to take on new challenges, I&#8217;ve had the flexibility to do that for the last 12 years, and I&#8217;ve taken full advantage of that.</p>
<p>If someone comes to me and says, &#8220;Hey, I really think you should do this thing.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never done that thing before. I don&#8217;t know much about that thing. Let me go learn some more about that thing and then decide.&#8221; And then if I decide, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s going to be a challenge, but I&#8217;m going to do it anyway.&#8221; I feel like that&#8217;s where all the growth comes from. And those are the things that have allowed me to be more confident. Not just because of what I already know, but because of the fact that I&#8217;m willing to take a chance and willing to take on the challenge.</p>
<p>I know that I&#8217;ve done that before and I didn&#8217;t die. And I made some mistakes, but most of the time it went pretty well. I&#8217;m like, that just gives me more confidence to do it again to something that&#8217;s unknown that I&#8217;ve never done before. I was just like, &#8220;Okay, I did that. Everything was fine. Okay, let&#8217;s try it again.&#8221; So I think so much of that is just taking chances too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Whose work are you inspired by right now?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, quite a few people. Some of them are visual, of course, and then some of them are just community-based kind of things. I love what Kenny Thacker is doing with a 100 Roses from Concrete in the advertising industry. I think the programming that they&#8217;re putting together and the resources that they&#8217;re providing for young Black people are just amazing.</p>
<p>Visually, I am a big fan of Bisa Butler and her work, and right now I just can&#8217;t get enough of it. My best friend bought me one of her coffee table books for Christmas, and it&#8217;s like one of my prize possessions right now. But I get inspiration from so many different places and I&#8217;m like discovering new people every day, truly every day. That&#8217;s why I tell my students all the time that I use social media as a curation tool.</p>
<p>So I usually don&#8217;t care how many people follow me, but on any of my platforms, if you go look at them, I probably follow three times more people than follow me, because I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Ooh, I want to see what this person is doing.&#8221; &#8220;Ooh, what is this person doing?&#8221; Ooh, I didn&#8217;t know about this artist. Let me follow them.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Ooh, that agency&#8217;s doing that. Let me follow them.&#8221; So I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;I just want all that good stuff coming in my feed when I log it on.&#8221; So I find new stuff and new people and new agencies and organizations and artists all the time. And that&#8217;s part of what feeds my creative process too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What haven&#8217;t you done yet that you want to do?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I want to travel the world. I do travel. I don&#8217;t travel as much as I would like to, but I would like to hit the majority of the countries before I leave this Earth, so that&#8217;s one thing. Another is I need to finish my book. I think the last time I was on with you, I might have talked about my book and it has been sitting in a dark closet for a long time. I did the first draft of it, and then I just kind of let it go. In retrospect, I think I might&#8217;ve just gotten scared and was like, &#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t do this.&#8221; But I definitely want to revisit it. I&#8217;m going to pick it up again. I still feel like the subject matter is important. I think it&#8217;s still relevant and I still want to do it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a book about branding, and I just feel like there&#8217;s not enough resources out there that make it plain what branding really is. And I think especially for entrepreneurs who are trying to build a brand and don&#8217;t know what that means, or even for individuals who are trying to build a brand for themselves and don&#8217;t know how to do that, I think that there&#8217;s a lot of insight, hopefully, that I can provide. So I definitely want to tackle that and get it back up and running. I just hate that I didn&#8217;t finish it, so it&#8217;s got to get finished.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I think if you go back and take a look at it, especially with all the knowledge you&#8217;ve gained now, you&#8217;ll probably see some things in there that you can update, that you can maybe add to-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
For sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; or something. So take your-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Definite change.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; time with it. Take your time with it. I mean, the thing with books, I mean, I&#8217;m finding this out myself as I&#8217;m working on a book, which I guess is a sort a scoop. I mean by the time this comes out, people will know that I&#8217;m working on a book about Revision Path. But-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Ooh, I&#8217;m excited.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve been working on a book about Revision Path and it has been a journey. Because at first I was like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, I&#8217;m going to do it about the show or whatever.&#8221; And I was talking to my editor and he is like, &#8220;No, you have to go deeper.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;There&#8217;s not really that much to it. I wanted to do the show, and I did the show.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;No, you have to go, go back further. Where did the seed start?&#8221; And it&#8217;s taken me all the way back to my childhood. It&#8217;s like a therapy session-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; trying to get through this book. I mean, I don&#8217;t know when it&#8217;s going to come out because I&#8217;m still working on&#8230; Well, one, I&#8217;m working on the proposal, but then just even all of the thought to go into how I&#8217;m going to approach the story and talk about it and everything, it&#8217;ll be good when it comes out. It&#8217;ll be sort of parts autobiography part about the show, but-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Oh, man. That sounds awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; it&#8217;s a lot. It&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Yes, it is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
It is a lot. And I think it is a major undertaking. So I feel like even when I started it several years ago, I told myself that even being willing to take on a project that big, is a victory, period.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Full stop.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; absolutely. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Regardless of what happens after that, that is a victory.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want the next chapter of your legacy to be?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
To be honest, I&#8217;m kind of leaving it up to the universe a little bit. I think part of this break that I&#8217;m taking is just about getting some rest and giving myself a chance to take a break and be able to hear my own voice about what I want next. The benefit of all the work and the thing, the people that I&#8217;ve been connected to and done stuff with and collaborated with, it&#8217;s such a blessing that I have several opportunities to do things next, but I want to make sure that I make the right move. I want to make sure that what I&#8217;m doing next is going to be fulfilling, that it&#8217;s going to allow me to grow, because that&#8217;s always something that I want. I never want to stop growing. So I&#8217;m really taking a break just so that I can hear my own voice and decide what&#8217;s next.</p>
<p>But also I&#8217;m taking my hands off of it a little bit and sort of letting things unfold the way that they should unfold. I think sometimes, and I&#8217;ve had to learn this the hard way, because sometimes I just want to plan everything, but so often when we try to make plans, the plans that we make are coming from our perspective. You can&#8217;t plan something that you don&#8217;t know about to some degree. But I think that sometimes you need to let there be some divine intervention, some universe to step in, because sometimes the things that we think we want next isn&#8217;t big enough, because we can&#8217;t see it yet.</p>
<p>And so I feel like I don&#8217;t know what it is, but in my heart, I feel like that&#8217;s where I am. I&#8217;m at that kind of space where it&#8217;s time for something big, but I don&#8217;t know what that thing is, yet. So I&#8217;m just going to center myself and take some time and figure out what that is. Branding Chicks, of course, will still be part of the equation, at least for now, but I feel like there&#8217;s so much more to do and so many more people to have fun with and create with. So I&#8217;m excited about whatever it ends up being, to be honest. I just don&#8217;t know all of what it is yet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I think that&#8217;s a good place to be though. To know that you have this possibility or all these possibilities ahead of you and just be excited for what that could be. That&#8217;s a great place to be, because a lot of folks are stuck if they don&#8217;t know what or whatever they think might be coming next is just more of the same thing. So to have that, I guess, opportunity to dream in that way, that&#8217;s priceless. That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
You have to believe it first. That&#8217;s what believing really is, right? If it was already concrete and set in stone, then you don&#8217;t have to believe in it. It&#8217;s just there. So sometimes you have to just believe that it&#8217;s going to be great and that it&#8217;s coming and that it&#8217;s yours, and that you&#8217;re going to have what you&#8217;re supposed to have, period. I believe that. So I don&#8217;t know all of what that&#8217;s going to look like. I don&#8217;t know all the details, but I do believe that I&#8217;m going to have what I&#8217;m supposed to have and I think it&#8217;s going to be good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
You can check us out at brandingchicks.com. That&#8217;s where you can find all of my work there. And Bella Boss is bellabossbox.com. The site is on hiatus right now while we pivot, but you can still find us there. And also on social media, you can check out Branding Chicks, both on Instagram and Facebook, and for Bella Boss Box, also on Instagram, Facebook, and I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re on Twitter, no, but Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, Sounds good. Well, Nakita Pope, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I feel like every time that I see you, and I know that you and I haven&#8217;t seen each other in a while, because of-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
I know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; the pandemic, but every time I see you, you are such a just bright light of just like energy and positivity. And I know that the Atlanta community, of course, knows this, that&#8217;s why you have that AIGA Fellow Award. But when I think of somebody that is always such a positive, just, influence in the design community locally and otherwise, I think of you. So I&#8217;m just-</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Thank you very much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; so glad that you&#8217;re still doing your thing. I&#8217;m excited to see what you come up with next. And thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Nakita M. Pope:</b><br>
Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you so much for that. And thank you for always supporting me. And I love these conversations, whether they happen on the podcast or not, where we&#8217;re just catching up. So thank you so much. I appreciate it.</p>

<p>If I had to give an award for &#8220;Most Chill Revision Path Guest&#8221;, Jordan Taylor would win the prize with no competition. But don&#8217;t let the relaxed vibes fool you, because his skills as a designer and creator are anything but laid-back. And even better, he has roots here in Atlanta. Keep listening to learn more about this hometown hero!</p>
<p>We started off talking about his recent move to NYC, and he gave a peek behind the curtain of being a designer at the world-famous design firm Pentagram. From there, Jordan talked about growing up and attending college in Atlanta (taught by past Revision Path guest <a href="/nakita-m-pope" data-wpel-link="internal">Nakita M. Pope</a>!) We also touched on a few other topics, including Atlanta‚Äôs design scene, and what Jordan wants to see more of from the larger design community. Jordan is a uniquely talented, and I think we‚Äôre going to see a lot more of his work in the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
I&#8217;m Jordan Taylor. I&#8217;m a graphic designer at Pentagram. I work on a lot of different projects, mostly branding, but a fair share of editorial and motion design, a few websites here and there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has the year been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
My year has been pretty great. I recently moved to a new place for the first time. I&#8217;m now living out in Brooklyn, New York. I moved up here for work and it&#8217;s been a chance to go on new adventures, see different things, meet new people. It&#8217;s been pretty interesting. A lot of changes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you sort of look at the year in general where we&#8217;re at now, we&#8217;re recording this right now in mid August. Is there anything that you want to accomplish before the year ends?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Oh, I&#8217;d say that right now I&#8217;m in a place where I&#8217;m trying to figure out what my next thing is. One of the things I really want to accomplish for the years over is starting to make those steps toward whatever that looks like, whether it&#8217;s an expression of self or new business endeavors. Just starting to really get back into more self-activated things. You know how they say you are always going to need to fall a couple times when you&#8217;re on your journey somewhere. I&#8217;m ready to start taking those baby&#8217;s first steps toward whatever new horizon I&#8217;m heading toward. I feel like I&#8217;m in that kind of place.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Now, you&#8217;re at Pentagram, which is a extremely, extremely well known design consultancy. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Yeah. Pentagram is so many things. I&#8217;m there now. I&#8217;ve been working there coming up on two years in September. When I started, it was as a remote position. I started as an intern, but I was working from home still down in Atlanta. The journey there was just so unexpected. I just didn&#8217;t think that it was a place I was going to get to. When I started really diving into design, you get introduced to different ways of doing things and what brand design looks like and who the kind of designers to know are. You find out about different names and you end up finding out about Pentagram.<br>
It just is a crazy experience to walk in there and actually see these people in person and not from even a crowd for some sort of forum that they&#8217;re putting on. It&#8217;s been really interesting just even beyond the partners, you have all the people working there on the different teams and you find out how a team works and how they approach projects and different ways that people think. It&#8217;s like a big incubator. It is really been&#8230; The way I got there was so much so of just putting my head down because it was the middle of the pandemic and just trying to get to the best place I could after leaving school.<br>
So in a way, I don&#8217;t always fully take it in, but in those moments that I do, it just really hits me and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m actually in here every day,&#8221; if that makes sense. It&#8217;s a lot of work, but it&#8217;s also a lot of just like air of ridiculousness to me. It&#8217;s actually worked out to this level.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like it&#8217;s hard to put into words. I mean, I&#8217;m listening to you stabber to talk about it. But I mean, I can imagine you&#8217;ve got such design heavyweights like Michael Beirut and Paula Scher and Eddie Opara whom we&#8217;ve had on the show episode 234 if people want to check that out. But I can imagine having that much, I guess, the weight of it all is probably a lot to think about from your perspective.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
And then at the same time I still have work to do every day. I still have four or five projects to work on. So it&#8217;s a balancing act. You try to make yourself known and get to know people. But at the same time, you&#8217;re still trying to keep the main thing, the main thing, and I guess do the work that got you there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you&#8217;ve done that. I mean, you&#8217;ve done the work that got you there. It&#8217;s not like you just walked in off the street into Pentagram. Like you said, you had your head down working and we&#8217;ll get more into your background or your story, but you deserve to be there.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Absolutely. Yeah. I say all these things about how it feels to be there, but I don&#8217;t think I ever really felt I didn&#8217;t belong, maybe just that I didn&#8217;t expect for anybody to actually figure that out, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does a typical day look like for you at Pentagram?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
A typical day for me when I first started there as an intern, one of the big things that I was really aware of was that I was probably not going to understand how anything worked. So I would reach out to my mentors, one of which was Louis Mikolay. He used to work at Collins. Now he&#8217;s at Apple. I reached out to John Ferguson and McCoy Smith. I just asked them, &#8220;You all are professionals. You all are in this design world. How do you actually keep track of all the things that you&#8217;re supposed to do in the day? How do you know how much time to allocate to a project? If you got multiple projects going on, how do you know when to start the day or when to end the day?&#8221; Because it was working from home and starting out. Everything was a little too soft for me.<br>
Long story short, I got into making to-do list to start the day or sometimes I make one to fill out the whole week. If I knew what the week had, coming ahead of me. After that, it really depends on the day to day what point I&#8217;m at in the week. But I&#8217;ll usually try and get the smaller projects out of the way or the little things, or just check my emails and make sure that nobody is kind of hitting me with a curve ball before I really get my day started.<br>
And from there, I collaborate with my team to make sure that I know what their expectations are for the day. And then it&#8217;s working things out. If I am on a magazine project like Netflix Queue, it may be a lot of concept. And so it&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;We&#8217;re building a deck to introduce to the client. And then from there you might break away from that side of it and go to the print side and you&#8217;re coming up with different concepts and directions.&#8221;<br>
So you&#8217;re doing a lot of art directing, but then right after that, I might have to create animation assets for a branding project where we&#8217;re trying to activate the brand for a presentation. So it&#8217;s a lot of flipping switches is what I call it. It&#8217;s a lot of flip this on, flip that off, go over here, do this. And then you just end up at 6:00.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s the day.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You, I guess, touched on some of the projects you&#8217;re working on. You mentioned this magazine, Netflix Queue. What kind of other projects and stuff are you working on?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
The projects I&#8217;m working on right now, I can&#8217;t really speak about. Some other projects I have worked on before, we did a wonderful rebrand for a college out in Pennsylvania who that was transitioning into university status called Moravian university. I worked on tech brand who was building out a whole kind of workspace system along the blockchain. So you really had ownership of your information called Skiff. I also work on the ACLU magazine that comes out twice a year. So it&#8217;s a wide range. And then there&#8217;s things that I help out with in spots here or there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you&#8217;re doing print projects, digital projects, kind of a little bit of everything, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Yeah. A lot of flipping those switches and within those, the Netflix magazine has a digital arm and a print arm. So I&#8217;m on both of those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Sometimes we might have to create a cover animation for the website and then you also have to create print stories. I mean, build out those assets. So your vision for the brand in all these different formats and it&#8217;s all happening at the same time. Whereas with the ACLU magazine is strictly print, but it involves a lot of art directions.<br>
So I&#8217;m commissioning illustrators. I&#8217;m commissioning photographers. I mean, we&#8217;re like staying on the pulse of what&#8217;s going on with the Supreme Court to find out what their rulings are going to be before the next issue. And then with something like Moravian, you just got old fashioned branding. So you&#8217;re building out color systems and typography and things like that.<br>
I mean, it sounds exciting to be able to use your skills to bounce from project to project in that way. One of the last big creative projects I worked on actually was also a print and digital magazine for my former employer, because I just got laid off. But for my former employer, I was putting together a print and digital magazine. The first issue is out. Actually the second issue was ready the day they laid our whole team off. So I don&#8217;t know if the second issue will even see the light of day, even though it&#8217;s literally at the printer on the shelf. Don&#8217;t know if anyone&#8217;s ever going to see it.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Sounds like Limited edition.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. And the third issue we were in the middle of working on, which was actually going to be on Web3 stuff. We commissioned illustrators. We had all the same things you were mentioning, writers, all that kind of stuff. Don&#8217;t know if that one is ever going to happen. I love the magazine thing because it was my first time ever working on something like that. I would love to do more things like that.<br>
It just seems like two things with Pentagram. One, you get to work on so many different types of projects. And two, I guess, because Pentagram just has this like&#8230; To me, maybe not to other people, but to me it has this untouchable&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say cult status because its name happens to be Pentagram, but it&#8217;s one of those things like, &#8220;No, don&#8217;t apply to us. We will choose you to work for us.&#8221; Like that sort of thing. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s just part of the mystique of Pentagram, but I like that.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I conflict on that. So a bit of how I actually ended up finding the position, I had joined Where are the Black Designers slack channel. [inaudible 00:14:28]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Mitzi.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Yeah. One of the project managers at Pentagram posted the opening and I was like, &#8220;Oh, this is crazy. I don&#8217;t even know they did this.&#8221; And the week went along and I was like, &#8220;Oh, should I do it, should I not?&#8221; I applied through there, but that&#8217;s not usually how it happens and it&#8217;s something that Pentagram is trying to get better about is like casting a wider net and bringing in more perspectives.<br>
I don&#8217;t know. The idea of that exclusivity, it creates the mystique you know, but I feel like in a world where we&#8217;re starting to just keep reconsidering these ideas of diversity and inclusion, when you&#8217;re at the top and you think you know what&#8217;s best, you don&#8217;t really allow anyone else to come in from the outside and influence and keep you there, you&#8217;re just moving off of&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I feel like it makes it easier for you to lose sight of what&#8217;s actually going on around you if you&#8217;re not actually interacting with the people, so to speak.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I get what you&#8217;re saying. I totally get that because I think a lot of agencies probably have that same sort of problem. Yes, they want to have a level of exclusivity with the work, but I guess they don&#8217;t want to appear like they&#8217;re for everybody I suppose.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s a tough balance, which I get. Look, just as a person who felt like they were on the outside, looking in and very much based on what I have come to find out just being in the workplace is not a common way of finding out about openings there. I just would hate to for the other person who&#8217;s in that same position and just wasn&#8217;t on the slack channel that day or that week.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. They just missed out.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
And they&#8217;re just as good as I am. I just think about stuff like that and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, it conflicts me a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit. I want you to remain conflicted in the interview, but because this is about you and about your skill. Like I said, you deserve to be there certainly. Let&#8217;s switch gears here. Let&#8217;s talk about you. Tell me where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
I grew up 30 miles east straight down Act 20 from Atlanta, Georgia in Lithonia. It&#8217;s a Black suburb. It&#8217;s a pretty decent place to live. It was a lot quieter until Atlanta&#8217;s always constantly growing and expanding. So people started moving out there a lot more. But I was out there since I was two years old, like &#8217;96 and then I moved out of the Atlanta area last October.<br>
I spent a long time out there, just deep in that culture, moving around town, making friends. I was a part of the Atlanta public schools system throughout with a little bit of DeKalb County Schools in elementary. I feel like a country bumpkin sometimes being in New York now. But I feel like my experience in my kind of neck of the woods was just so interesting. I just got to see so many different things and so many different ways to live out my Blackness, I guess. My whole family is from the Atlanta area. So it just was a really warm, just loving experience the whole time. I miss it a lot. I think about it every day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, you grew up in Atlanta during a time. I mean that to me feels like peak Atlanta like the Olympics Freaknik &#8217;96, that whole time. I came to Atlanta in &#8217;99. So right after that. But I&#8217;m from Alabama, I&#8217;m from Selma, so I&#8217;m not that far from Atlanta. I&#8217;m roughly about three hours. We would always come to Atlanta, honestly, every summer or every time, I don&#8217;t know, our class did well on the SATs or something. It was always like, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to Six Flags. We&#8217;re going to Six Flags.&#8221;<br>
So I&#8217;ve always been in and around Atlanta and then finally moved here when I was 18. But I know exactly that feeling that you&#8217;re talking about. And it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m sort of exploring a little bit, because I&#8217;m working on a book proposal. And as I&#8217;m working through it, there&#8217;s such a positive thread of Blackness throughout Atlanta that I don&#8217;t think a lot of people really get.<br>
I think people see Atlanta, they see the entertainments, they see the music. They see, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s a really Black city.&#8221; But it&#8217;s a warmth, I think that a lot of people don&#8217;t really understand unless you&#8217;re either from there or you&#8217;ve really lived there for a long time. I mean, I feel like I got it a little bit just from visiting so much, but certainly my formative years and my teens&#8230; Not even my teens, but really my late teens and my 20s in Atlanta is just irreplaceable. It&#8217;s hard to put that feeling into words about the&#8230; It&#8217;s not even so much of a positive Blackness, but as much as every example of excellence that you see around you is Black.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think sometimes that can be hard even for other Black people to see depending on where they grew up. But Atlanta really sort fosters that and it&#8217;s not in any sort of weird supernatural extraordinary way. It&#8217;s like excellence is just all around you.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Yeah. A very casual Blackness.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s such a good way to put it, a very casual Blackness. That&#8217;s such a good way to put it.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Yeah. For me, people are constantly on this notion of Blackness is not a monolith. That&#8217;s what I mean, what we&#8217;re both talking about with that casual Blackness. I wouldn&#8217;t put myself in a certain frame. I always talk to my friends like we all played sports, but we all like anime. We all ended up doing different jobs. I have friends who were in the arts, but I also have friends who are paramedics, and I also have friends who are party promoters.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s no division.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s no division.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I a hundred percent know exactly what you mean. I mean, I went to Morehouse, so I absolutely know of what that division can definitely look like. But yeah, man, I mean, you grew up here in a great, great [inaudible 00:20:49]. I can tell why you miss it. I can definitely tell why. Was art and design kind of a big part of you growing up here?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
I would say it was, but it was more from a sense of&#8230; It was something that I was just always interested in. You get older and you look back on your life and you realize you were doing things the whole time that were preparing you for something you didn&#8217;t even know you were preparing yourself for. So it wasn&#8217;t more so that design or the arts was constantly around me.<br>
Nobody in my family is like a designer. My mom is a school counselor. My dad works at the EPA. It was just constantly something that I was interested in. I watched a lot of TV, a lot of Cartoon Network, a lot of Nickelodeon, a lot of Disney, a lot of anime, a lot of Toonami. Those kind of things are what introduced me into the arts and made me appreciate art a lot more.<br>
So I think the first thing I ever tried to draw was Goku on one of my school notepads. And from there, I kept drawing and drawing and doodling. But it wasn&#8217;t something that I really embraced as something that would ever be a part of my future. It was more so just something that I enjoyed and it was an outlet for me. It helped me express something that I really cared about. And then I got opportunities later on in high school to express those things in different ways. I knew I had that drawing talent and my mom would put me into these art programs over the summer to learn more about the technical side.<br>
I did one in old Fort Worth at this summer camp where we had to choose a discipline. So I went with the drawing one, because it was the one that I was the best at. I got those things, but it was never something that I thought that I was actually ever going to be doing with my life. When I was about to graduate high school, I planned on doing engineering. Focusing on that is part of my college curriculum. Because like I said, I was preparing myself for things that I didn&#8217;t actually know were available to me. I was like, &#8220;Okay, well I&#8217;m good at math and science, but I also want to create things.&#8221;<br>
I didn&#8217;t know how to express that completely. So my dad was working at the EPA. I was like, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s an engineer. Maybe I&#8217;ll be an engineer and maybe I&#8217;ll get to tinker on things or build something one day. But it wasn&#8217;t something that I was fully embracing. I definitely went to the high museum way more during my college days than I ever did during grade school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But it sounds like your parents though, at least supported you in that, I guess you could say at that point was a hobby, was you really liking art and drawing. They didn&#8217;t try to dissuade you from it.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
No, they never dissuade me from anything. I think I get a lot of my laid back kind of attitude from them because they&#8217;re very much&#8230; They were very much always, as long as I handled what I was supposed to be doing at school or whatever, then they would let me do whatever I wanted to in the peripheries. They never really tried to shut me down from anything and I always appreciate them for that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you ended up going to Georgia State University. And Atlanta&#8217;s got some well known design schools here. I mean, let&#8217;s see. If you were&#8230; I&#8217;m trying to think was it&#8230; No, Atlanta College of Art wasn&#8217;t around during that time. But I mean, we had Art Institute of Atlanta. I think SCAD was just maybe starting to have their campus here. I don&#8217;t recall. But there&#8217;s also things like the Portfolio Center, et cetera. I don&#8217;t know if Georgia State really is ever in that conversation of great design schools or curriculums in the city. How was your time there?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
I really enjoyed my time there. So my introduction to Georgia State came a bit later in college. I transferred there. I first off went to Fort Valley State University. It&#8217;s a HBCU like an hour south of Macon, I think, near Warner Robins.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yep, I&#8217;m familiar.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Yeah. Oh, you know about Fort valley?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know about Fort Valley.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
That was where I went because I thought I was going to be engineers. My mom was like, &#8220;Okay, go to this agricultural school. They have an engineering program. You can do that.&#8221; And while I was there, I found out more about graphic design. I would hear about it here and there on the internet, but I didn&#8217;t know how it worked. I found out what Adobe was. I was like, &#8220;Okay. Well, my laptop is not good enough to do any of that kind of stuff.&#8221;<br>
But I ended up taking an elective my second year there and it was for graphic design. I think our first project was that we had to create a fake brand and then we had to make envelopes for the brand. Our teacher taught us how to use the blend tool. We could use the blend tool if we wanted to, but otherwise we had to just come up with something else. Long story short, I got an A in the class and I was like, &#8220;Wait a minute. I just made something and it felt like art.&#8221; I got an A and I don&#8217;t really want to be an electrical engineer. That&#8217;s fourth floor.<br>
I called my mom right before I was about to go back home because the semester ended and I was like, &#8220;Hey, I looked it up. Georgia State has graphic design program.&#8221; Because I think I looked into all those other schools, but like I said, my mom never stifled me from anything, but she always made me very aware of what she could and couldn&#8217;t do. So I knew she wasn&#8217;t about to pay for me to go to SCAD.<br>
I called her, I was like, &#8220;Hey, I got an A in this graphic design class. I want to transfer up to Georgia State.&#8221; I&#8217;m going to major in it. They have a program up there. She was like, &#8220;Wait a second. It is the first semester. Could you at least finish the next semester and make sure you want to do this?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;No, I got to go.&#8221;<br>
But she made me finish that next semester. I spent that whole semester in my free time learning how to use illustrator. When I finally started, I was so eager. I started taking classes at Georgia State over the summer because I wanted to get in there because I couldn&#8217;t use my laptop. I was using the school stuff at Fort Valley to design. I was like, &#8220;Okay, I don&#8217;t want to spend a whole summer not working on this because I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing and I don&#8217;t know how good any of these people in these classes are about to be when I start.&#8221;<br>
So I spent that whole summer in the Georgia State computer lab, just working on Illustrator. Photoshop, I was kind of like, &#8220;Ah, there&#8217;s kind of too many different ways to do things on there. I&#8217;m just going to keep doing Illustrator.&#8221; I mean, I had a great time in Georgia State&#8217;s graphic design program. I would say to anyone that&#8217;s thinking about it based on our conversation right now that it really helped cement a lot of the basics and a lot of the fundamentals of what design is, how do you approach it? What does it mean to create a creative identity?<br>
I took a lot of the introductory classes because it&#8217;s broken up into two different sections. So you take the intro classes and then you have to go through a portfolio review to get to the final stage and actually graduate with a design degree.<br>
I didn&#8217;t make it to that second part because I was missing a project. I learned so much from the experience that I knew I could design. They even said it. They were like, &#8220;Some people might not make it. That doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re not good.&#8221; There&#8217;s plenty of people that don&#8217;t make it. Because there&#8217;s so particular and they have such a hard cutoff in terms of the numbers because of the size of the program right now.<br>
They really encouraged you to keep going and that&#8217;s what I did. I was like, &#8220;I know what I&#8217;m doing. I know how to build a brand. I know how to use Illustrator and Photoshop. I made all these projects. I didn&#8217;t do all this for no reason.&#8221; So I just stuck to it after that and stayed in contact with all my teachers from all my introductory classes because they continued to keep their doors open for me. I would definitely recommend it.<br>
Anybody thinking about going to SCAD or those other art schools, I would say to look into Georgia State because their program is really great and they really supported me the entire time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was going to say, it sounds like they really kind of helped prepare you to get out there and be a designer. Even though, as you said, you didn&#8217;t go through and do the project portion of it, but you still came out with enough know-how to know how to be a designer.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you enrolled at The Creative Circus a couple of years after you graduated from Georgia State. What made you do that?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
I enrolled there because after I didn&#8217;t make it to the second portion of the design program, I continued to work. I started trying to find different outlets for what I could do. So I was like, &#8220;Okay. I&#8217;m not in the program.&#8221; So I would do things for people here and there. I got a intern position at the APEX Museum, which was right down the street from the Georgia State campus. It&#8217;s a Black history museum. They really gave me a great chance to try and do my things in actual application and step with their own identity.<br>
There was just something in the back of my head, as I kept learning about design and learning about Eddie Opara, and Michael Beirut, and Paula Scher and those kind of people. There was something beyond that, that I didn&#8217;t really know how to do yet. So along with those other things that I was doing in terms of working, I was also trying to meet more people that were also designing.<br>
So I joined the AIGA student chapter in Atlanta and I ended up meeting one of the teachers at The Creative Circus because the meeting I went to was at The Creative Circus. So I got to see little bits and pieces before I walked into our meeting space. I was like, &#8220;Hey, is this an art school?&#8221; Because I didn&#8217;t even know what it was. It was like off a Cheshire Bridge off of a back street.<br>
She was like, &#8220;Yeah, this is an art school.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Do you all have a design program?&#8221; And she was like, &#8220;Yeah, we have a design program.&#8221; It was a Nakita Pope.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Nakita. Love Nakita. She&#8217;s been on the show before.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, we have a design program. I&#8217;m actually one of the instructors for it. If you ever want to come back, I&#8217;ll give you a tour. You can sit in on one of my classes.&#8221; She let me walk around for a bit before I had to leave. And they have all the work on the walls from previous students&#8217; projects. I saw that stuff and I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to do any of this.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I thought I was good at it and I don&#8217;t know how to do any of this. But if they know how to do this, I think I can figure it out.&#8221;<br>
Long story short, I talked to my mom. I was like, &#8220;Hey, thinking about going back to school. It&#8217;s going to cost yada, yada, yada.&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Wait a minute. [inaudible 00:32:11] stick with me.&#8221; That took some discussing because my parents had already paid for four years of school. So I went there. It did what I expected it to&#8230; It took me to a whole nother level in terms of understanding. What it really helped me with was concepting, being able to build an idea and then flush it out graphically in a multitude of ways.<br>
So what I learned from Georgia State in my introductory classes was that what makes a good logo, how to pick out typography, things like that like the building blocks. And then when I got to The Creative Circus, they really pushed those different levels of self expression and leaving no stone unturned when you&#8217;re trying to tell the story of something. So it all came together to put together the picture.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And for folks that don&#8217;t know or haven&#8217;t heard of The Creative Circus, it&#8217;s this private for-profit college recently closed its doors, which is such a big loss to the Atlanta design community. I hope they come back one day, but The Creative Circus and Nakita Pope who you mentioned as an instructor there. I think I&#8217;ve been there a couple of times. I know, I remember seeing, I think it was Douglas Davis had given a talk there when he was doing his book tour for his book about creative strategy and the business of design.<br>
Nakita and Douglas knew each other because they both went to Hampton. Although, I don&#8217;t know if they went at the same time or not, but yeah, The Creative Circus, great, great resource to the city. Sad that it&#8217;s closed. But no, it sounds like you got what you needed from there. And you also have interned at a few places in Atlanta. You mentioned Apex over on Auburn Avenue. You interned at the Mammal Gallery, which is downtown Atlanta. You interned at MetroFresh Uptown. These are three somewhat different types of design experiences, it seems like. What did each of those places really teach you?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Yeah, they were so interesting looking back on them. It was very much, I was still in that phase of trying to scrounge together different experiences any way I could. I was out of college and I just had to dive into things that I was interested in. I was like, &#8220;I love my people. Let&#8217;s go to the Apex.&#8221; I was like the Mammal Gallery back then. I&#8217;m not even sure if the Mammal Gallery is still open, but they used to put on concerts where they would bring in these underground performers or these emerging artists. I was really into that because that was the mix tape era and SoundCloud era.<br>
So I was like, &#8220;Hey, I love this place. Let me ask if they need a graphic designer.&#8221; Because everybody needs a graphic designer. And then with MetroFresh Uptown, that was taking something that I needed and trying to bring something that I wanted into it.<br>
So I got the job because I needed a job because I was working. At The Creative Circus, I made it past the first quarter and it was time for me to try and figure out how to keep paying to be there. I&#8217;d done a lot of food service jobs. I picked that one up because I had heard about&#8230; I don&#8217;t even remember how I heard about the opening, but I&#8217;m not going to dwell on that. And because I was working at a new location for them, I was like, &#8220;Hey, do you all need signage? Do you need somebody to draw murals? Do you need somebody to make pamphlets for you to pass out in this office building? I could do all that stuff.&#8221; And it worked out from there.<br>
But it prepared me for what I would do like the next internship that I was in for a really long time because it gave me a chance to be a part of something and know what the identity was and how to bring that out in that graphic language.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And that other place that you&#8217;re talking about, that&#8217;s Atlanta Contemporary. You were there for pretty much, almost five years. That&#8217;s a really long time. Talk to me about what that experience was like.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
I love the Atlantic contemporary. I talk about the place all the time. For anybody who&#8217;s listening and is in the Atlanta area, it&#8217;s free every day. I think they&#8217;re only closed on Sundays. They might be closed on Mondays now, but they&#8217;re definitely closed on Sundays. It&#8217;s a contemporary art space, but it&#8217;s also an art center. So they do a lot of events where they bring in the community and they have children&#8217;s events. They do weddings, all that kind of stuff.<br>
But it was that kind of last step in finding things that I was interested in. I was like, okay. So I worked at a Black history museum. I&#8217;ve done things for music space. I&#8217;ve done things for restaurants. What else am I interested in? If I could ever get a job at a museum, that would be really cool. I was like if I could ever actually make graphics for something based in the arts, that would be incredible.<br>
So I went around to all the spots that you can think of. I went to the High Museum, I went to MOCA, I went to the Atlanta History Center. I was just Googling these places and then I would spend the day and go to them. And eventually, I went to the Atlanta contemporary. I was like, &#8220;Oh, do you all have any openings?&#8221; They were like, &#8220;No, we already have a graphic design.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Oh well, okay. Do you do internships?&#8221; They were like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Do the interns do any graphic design?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Well, if I intern, could I do some graphic design?&#8221; And they were like-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You were trying. You were trying to get in there.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Yeah. And they were like, &#8220;I mean, maybe. Sure.&#8221; So I just took those opportunities wherever I could get them. It was a chance for me to interact with the community because people would come in for different exhibit exhibition openings and people would have the artist talks there and things. They had a whole pavilion in the back where they housed certain artists within their studios. So I got to interact with there. That was cool.<br>
But then here and there, if they had an event, they were like, &#8220;Hey, Jordan. Could you make some signage? Hey, Jordan, could you make a flyer? Hey Jordan, could you do the vinyl descriptions for the artwork this month?&#8221; It would trickle in slowly. I built up a rapport with everybody that I was capable of doing these things. And then it turned into a full time position after that. When I got that chance to do that because the previous graphic designer had actually moved to New York because I had been there so long, I recommended different ways of going about how they express themselves with their social assets and things like that.<br>
I was like, &#8220;Hey, I feel like this could speak a lot more clearly to what you all actually have going on here.&#8221; It&#8217;s so interesting and fun here. I think that this could be expressed a different way. So it was a chance for me to build a proposal. And then from there, it really bled into a lot of things. I was creating their monthly social posts. I was creating special animated assets whenever they had a special event going on.<br>
I was doing their event graphics. I was doing the way finding within the museum, or within the art space, excuse me. And then I was also still doing the vinyl descriptors for the exhibitions also. And then I even got to help with one of the art pieces one time. They had this mantra that they wanted to put on the wall, but the guy walked in with just&#8230; It typed out from a typewriter on a piece of paper and he was like, &#8220;I wanted to look exactly like this, but on the wall.&#8221;<br>
 I was like, &#8220;Well, aren&#8217;t you the artist? You don&#8217;t know how to do that? But that was a chance to really collaborate with the artist and get their vision across, but then also I had to collaborate with the more practical people, the vinyl makers and figure out how I could create his vision and make it sense to them as the go between. So it was a lot.<br>
I mean, I met a lot of incredible people. Just an invaluable experience. It pops back up every time I&#8217;m trying to do something. Earlier when I talked about flipping those switches, that was the first place where I really had to flip switches. I might animate, but I might be doing social stuff, but I might be making a visitor&#8217;s brochure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds like you really spread your wings there creatively. You got to do a lot of different things.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Yeah, because of the nature of the space as a contemporary art space, it was very open to new ways of doing things or new approaches. They had their shareholders or their investors that you had to run things by in the final round. But all in all, it was very, like you said, a great experience to spread my wings and figure things out on the fly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;re currently in New York. Of course, that&#8217;s for work for Pentagram. But I&#8217;m curious when you think of your time here as a designer in Atlanta, what was the design community and scene for you? How would you describe it maybe to someone outside of Atlanta?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
I would say the design scene here&#8230; Or in Atlanta. I&#8217;m not there anymore. It&#8217;s a lot broader than you think it is. There&#8217;s a lot of incredible people just kind of like&#8230; You got to get in there, but once you get in there, there&#8217;s a lot of amazing people out there doing their thing, making their way. What makes it different from what I&#8217;ve encountered so far up here in New York, New York is very much a design city. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, the subway system and this and that.&#8221;<br>
But in Atlanta, what I really liked about the community out there is everyone was very much so making a way for themselves and finding their pocket or their niche and figuring things out. And the community comes together for different things like AIGA events and stuff. I would say the a G is a good way to find out what people are doing and find your group or what you&#8217;re most interested in. But everyone out there was being really resourceful or everyone out there had found their groove. They knew how to work it through all the ups and downs. One of my mentors, his name was Joe Price.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, I know Joe.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
You know Joe?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Great. He was freelance, but he had been freelancing for so long when I met him. He just was constantly like&#8230; He&#8217;s so good at rolling with the punches. Even during the pandemic, he just knew how to figure things out. But at the same time, because it&#8217;s such a more kind of non-mainstream thing to be a designer, I guess, he&#8217;s so quirky. I don&#8217;t think he thinks he is. Joe has pet squirrels in his workspace. It&#8217;s a little nook in his backyard. Just full of different design ephemera just all over the place. Just stacks of books on books, on books. It&#8217;s really incredible. I think it&#8217;s pretty great, but you got to get in there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
You&#8217;re not just going to get swept up in it, you got to get into it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Joe gave me the coolest piece of, I guess, design swag or ephemera that I&#8217;ve ever gotten from anyone. But I mean, I&#8217;ve been to conferences and I&#8217;ve talked to people all around the world. This was years and years ago. No one else has ever given me anything this cool. You&#8217;re going to laugh at this. It&#8217;s a beverage koozie like you put on cans.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Yeah. But it&#8217;s a paper bag. You see folks on the corner get a 40 or whatever and they&#8217;re drinking it right out the paper bag, it&#8217;s a paper bag koozie. And it&#8217;s actually a bag like you put the can like a regular 12-ounce can. You put it in the bag, and it&#8217;s got his logo on it. It is the coolest thing I have ever gotten from any designer anywhere. And I&#8217;ve gotten posters, books, figurines.<br>
And the thing is, I can&#8217;t find it anywhere. I don&#8217;t know where Joe got those from. I don&#8217;t know where he got those printed, the website of the bottom of it no longer exists, but I still have it. It&#8217;s in my silverware drawer, in my kitchen. It is the one coolest piece of design thing I ever got. It&#8217;s just a paper bag koozie. It&#8217;s paper bag on the outside, but it&#8217;s insulated on the inside. You just put a drink in it and then you feel like you&#8217;re drinking out of a paper bag. It&#8217;s the coolest thing.<br>
No, that sounds amazing. I never heard that. I&#8217;m going to have to ask him about it because that sounds incredible. It&#8217;s all crinkled and you put a paper bag and it&#8217;s like&#8230; All that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And from a distance, someone will think you&#8217;re just drinking out a small paper bag or something, but no, it&#8217;s a beverage koozie. It&#8217;s so cool. It&#8217;s so cool. Did you feel like there were any sort of particular challenges that you had to face here as a designer that you might not be facing in New York?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
I think the main one is just that&#8230; Like I said, it&#8217;s not a super&#8230; It&#8217;s just not as popular of a career path, I guess in Atlanta. So when it came time for me to find a career path or find a job or a gig, it was a little difficult. I found myself ending up at the same spots whenever I would try and find different avenues. The amount of times that I applied to Turner Broadcasting, it would shock and appall you. I applied to play so many times throughout college.<br>
After college, I was constantly Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, TNT, blah, blah, blah. It was so many times. And then as I got more into the design community, I found out more about different places that were available or even design shops like Matchstick and so forth. But I just think that there just aren&#8217;t as many options as there might be up in New York.<br>
But like I said, when you meet more people in the community, everyone has figured out their way and found their kind of niche and how to move and the space. But for me starting out, it was a little&#8230; There wasn&#8217;t as much of a depth of options as I thought they were going to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you ever get an interview with Turner?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
No. I never got past the video interview part. I did the submitted questionnaire and then one time I got to do a video interview, but never actually got to go there in person and sit down with anybody.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;ve got a line in your bio that says your approach to design is similar to one of your patented long walks around town. What does that mean?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Okay. It&#8217;s not like long walks on the beach type of thing. It&#8217;s actually a connection.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Yeah, unpack that for me.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Like I said, when I moved back to Atlanta after Fort Valley and I decided to become a designer, I would have to go into the city. So for five years I was going into the city every day from my house in Lithonia. So I was taking public transit. I was taking MARTA every day. I would get on the bus. This might be too granular for your wide audience, but I would go to Indian Creek and then I would take the train into the city. And then I would either have to walk or take another bus wherever else I was going.<br>
So doing that constantly is what I mean by those patented long walks. And what I mean when I say that my design is similar to those is that if you spend enough time on the ground, just walking everywhere, you&#8217;re going to see some interesting things. You&#8217;re going to appreciate more of what&#8217;s going on around you because you&#8217;re transitioning from a more forest area because there&#8217;s so many trees in the Atlanta area to like you go through the urban areas and you&#8217;re passing by restaurants, you&#8217;re passing by clubs, you&#8217;re passing by all these different things.<br>
You see a lot of weird stuff. You see a lot of interesting things. You might see some not so great things. But it all leaves an impact. I think that&#8217;s what I mean when I say it&#8217;s my patented long walks on the beach. So things might get a little weird. I might try and take some interesting left turns here or there, but it&#8217;s all for the sake of giving that impact.<br>
I want you to feel like you&#8217;re actually a part of the journey. I want you to feel like a story is being told to you. I want you to feel like there&#8217;s a lot of meaning and purpose behind what&#8217;s going on here. Because I wouldn&#8217;t be here right now if I didn&#8217;t have that sense of purpose to get up, leave my house and go do all these different things every day.<br>
When I was going to find my different internships, I walked there. When I was going to school at The Creative Circus, I walked there. And by walking, I mean it included public transit, but my feet were on the ground. I was like-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hear you.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
&#8230; back and forth. It&#8217;s weird. It&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s got a lot of purpose behind it. I feel like that&#8217;s how I design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
As you started saying that, for some reason that just reminded me of the first verse of Elevators from Outkast where you&#8217;re talking about taking MARTA through the hood, trying to find the hookup caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
I rode to 86. That was my bus.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
My bus was the 13 because I went to Morehouse and I was living in the west&#8230; Oh, well, I wasn&#8217;t living in the west end when I was at Morehouse, unless it was on campus. But I used to live in Buckhead in the Darlington before the Darlington got run down and now it&#8217;s like multimillion dollar condos or whatever. It used to be the 23, now it&#8217;s the 110. But I take the 23 to Art Center. I take Art Center to Five Points. I take the 13 from there. And it puts you off at the strip of Fair Street and Brawley, James P Brawley, which is the Clark Atlanta strip. That was class every day. I remember it finally. I have not ridden the 13 in years, but I remember that very fondly.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Yeah. I feel same way. Whenever I go back home and I see that bus when I go visit my mom or whatever, it&#8217;s a very funny feeling. Just like, oh, that used to be my life. I spent plenty of days running that thing down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, me too. Running down to 13. People that are not in Atlanta don&#8217;t know this, but the buses are terrible. There&#8217;s only a few that are fairly reliable. The 13 is pretty reliable. The 23, which is now the 110. The six to Emory is pretty reliable. I would imagine the 86 is probably pretty reliable too, but a lot of in-town buses, good luck. If you miss it, you&#8217;re waiting 30, 40 minutes for the next bus. It&#8217;s ridiculous.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
No, absolutely. I mean, the 86, it came, but I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s super reliable because I would have to show up 10 minutes early or I&#8217;m going to be an hour late because like you said, it might show up on time. It might show up 10 minutes early. It might show up 10 minutes late. But either way, if you miss it, you&#8217;re waiting another 40 minutes until the next one. No, definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember taking the 23 and sometimes what happened is&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if this happened on the 86, but the driver would get out and go into McDonald&#8217;s and get something to eat. Just leave the bus, people on the bus waiting to get where they got to go, but they got to get a McGriddle. They got to get their food and come&#8230; You better not be mad about it either because they&#8217;ll put you out.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
No, thanks. But my bus driver would always&#8230; Well, it didn&#8217;t happen all the time, but he stopped. I had a few bus drivers stop and get out and walk and go get some chicken wings and they come back. They would walk to the gas station.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yep. Oh, man. That&#8217;s a very particular just Atlanta transit thing that, that&#8217;s funny. I think about that and I just get a warm feeling like nostalgia.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
But like I said, it&#8217;s ridiculous. It just is Atlanta. It just is that journey.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What&#8217;s the best advice you&#8217;ve ever been given about design?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
I would say for where I&#8217;m at right now, the best advice I was given was not too long ago. I was talking to Eddie Opara, just trying to take advantage of the situation I&#8217;m in. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ve got to meet this man.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; We just had a conversation. I told him where I was at like where I was talking about earlier, how I feel like I&#8217;m just in this space where I&#8217;m trying to figure out what&#8217;s next. What do I want to keep doing? Or how do I keep moving forward? What he told me was that what you got to do as a designer is kind of figure out what your voice.<br>
You spend all this time learning the building blocks, learning the technical things like, &#8220;Oh, how do I use After Effects? How do I use InDesign?&#8221; And all this kind of stuff. But sometimes you can get lost in that and not realize that you have a way of expressing yourself. You have a voice. I feel like I do those things, but I don&#8217;t have my own world that I built out a vision for how people just immediately are like, &#8220;Oh, Jordan made this. This speaks to his sensibilities.&#8221; I&#8217;m very much more so in the production stage of where I&#8217;m at right now.<br>
So I think that was something that, &#8220;Oh, was really helpful to me.&#8221; He was talking about how you have to pick what means the most to you. Is it about paying it forward in which case maybe you do a lot more kind of teaching or instructing? Or is it about expressing the essence of what we do. In that case, you might do a lot more forums and TED talk type things.<br>
But it was really helpful just figuring out what means the most to you and how do you make that known to people? What is your identity as a designer?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s really good advice.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Next time you talk to Eddie, tell him I said what&#8217;s up.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Okay. Yeah. I should see him soon, so I&#8217;ll tell him.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What is it that keeps you motivated and inspired these days?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
I think what keeps me the most motivated is just&#8230; I know there&#8217;s so much more coming. There are a myriad of things that have gotten me to this point like the music I love, the artwork I love. I&#8217;m constantly making mood boards on Are.na or Pinterest of things that I think other people are doing and that are cool and they push me forward. But I think the things that keeps me the most hopeful for what&#8217;s coming in the future is that I know I have a place and I know that I&#8217;m in control of it ultimately. I just have to keep going forward and seeing what&#8217;s next, looking for those new opportunities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What more do you want to see from the design community? I feel like you are at this very unique place as not only just a young designer, but also a young designer at a place that has such a storied reputation, I would say. What do you want to see more of from the design community?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
I want to see more of Black people. I want to see more of me, more of us. I just want to see more of it. I think that we&#8217;re such a creative people. Our influence is so ridiculous. I think that when you think about that in the grand scope, the statistics around how many people of color are like, or how many Black people are designing is so disproportionately low when I&#8217;m thinking about the kind of impact we have on the sway of things in the American culture.<br>
I think that also something that I want to see more of is just based on my background and I guess a little bit of just being around my mom all the time. I want to see more people designing at earlier ages. I want that kind of stuff introduced to kids earlier and earlier. I think with the onset of the internet and TikTok and all those kind of things, I think it&#8217;s becoming a little more standardized at earlier ages and younger and younger kids are getting into it.<br>
But I did a talk for my mom&#8217;s elementary school a few months ago, just introducing them to what design is and the amount of feedback I got from not only the kids, but the teachers that didn&#8217;t know that it was an option and were just so blown away about the possibility of what design is and what it can do. I think that just needs to continue happening.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
In the next five years, I want to be doing more work that speaks to who I am. I wanted to speak to my interests. I wanted to impact the people that I care about the most. I wanted to continue to be as proud of my work as I am right now. I feel like I&#8217;m really proud of what I do, but it also isn&#8217;t a hundred percent mine. So I think that&#8217;s where I see myself in five years. Just really taking more ownership of my designs and applying them to what means most to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
You can find me on Instagram, @jiggyjordan. It&#8217;s J-I-G-G-Y-J-O-R-D. I have a website. It&#8217;s a keywordjord. K-E-Y-W-O-R-D-J-O-R-D. Other than that&#8230; I mean, I have an Are.na page. I enjoy that a lot. I&#8217;ve been really getting into that. Do you use Are.na at all?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
This was back in 2019, 2020, I worked with a designer, this really cool student named Perjohn. We used to work at Glitch together. He kind of turned me on to Are.na at first, because he was using it kind of as a sketchbook of sorts. I&#8217;ve never used it outside of that though. What is it like?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
So to me it&#8217;s a cooler Pinterest. I find a lot of design inspiration on there visually, but I see all kind of people doing different things on here. I&#8217;ve seen entire mood boards that are just full of random ideas. I&#8217;ve seen tons of people making video references, motion references, entire mood boards that are just free type faces. I mean, I enjoy it a lot. It&#8217;s a little grungy and underground, but that speaks to the stuff I like.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll have to check it out. What&#8217;s your name on Are.na?</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
It&#8217;s just Jordan Taylor. I think that&#8217;s the best way to find me on here. That&#8217;s the other thing. It&#8217;s a little hard to discover people on this thing, but I&#8217;ll message you. And if anybody else has any trouble finding me, they can let me know, I guess, on Instagram or something.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Jordan Taylor, I want to thank you so so much for coming on the show. I really wanted to have a young Atlanta designer on the show. I know you&#8217;re not in Atlanta anymore, but I think just your story of quiet perseverance and drive from growing up to going to school and even pursuing these internships, I think that&#8217;s something that a lot of people out here need to see, because I think we see enough of the alternative, which is I went to this fancy art school and now I went to this fancy agency or whatever.<br>
I think people see enough of the alternative and don&#8217;t see the folks out here that they&#8217;re quietly grinding. And I get the sense that you&#8217;ve really been quietly grinding, building your portfolio, improving your skills. And that&#8217;s gotten to where you are now at Pentagram of all places.<br>
I can&#8217;t wait to see what you do in five years, man. I&#8217;m really going to be keeping an eye out for you. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Jordan Taylor:</b><br>
Oh yeah. Thank you so much. I mean, this has been incredible. I appreciate it.</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Hi. So my name is Ashley Bozeman. I am an art director here at the Martin Agency, which is located in Richmond, Virginia. So as far as the title of my actual role, so basically I work in the creative department at a creative ad agency. I&#8217;m usually paired with a copywriter and together we are the ones who are briefed and tasked to basically come up with ideas for campaigns, commercials, social posts, really anything you can think of. It&#8217;s our job to basically come up with that creative idea. And then specifically as an art director, it&#8217;s my job to bring that to life visually. So how does that look? Who is being represented? What are the color choices? What are the style choices? Cinematography, &#8230; working with directors and things like that, but we basically just, we&#8217;re the ones who control how everything looks. Whereas our partners are copywriters, they are the ones who control the tone of voice and what that sounds like and the scripts and things like that. So together we&#8217;re the ones, kind of the big brains behind a lot of the things you&#8217;ll see on TV as far as commercials and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like your work is a lot of, I guess meetings and sort of heads down work sessions. Is that true?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah. Yes, definitely a lot of meetings, but it&#8217;s also a lot of concepting. So it&#8217;s a lot of just, I was briefed earlier today, we&#8217;ll get a brief and then we&#8217;ll look at our calendars, &#8220;Hey when you have some time.&#8221; We&#8217;ll put two or three hours on our schedules and then we&#8217;ll just find a room in the office and literally just sit and come up with ideas. Ideas that are large and kind of lofty that we&#8217;re not sure if the clients would ever even buy or do. And then ideas that also fit the brief exactly. So we basically, we&#8217;ll just kind of get together and just kind of brainstorm of different ways we can kind of find the best solution for that problem in the brief to be solved or for something to be showcased in the best way possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now this brief document that you get, this is coming? I&#8217;m assuming this is coming from the client or is this someone else is kind of putting this information together for you?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah, so internally we have our strategists, so our strategists are the ones who had to work with a client and then they come and work on their own research and insights. So, basically develop a kind of, just kind of a brief, so it just, it&#8217;ll give us insights. It&#8217;ll have the actual problem they&#8217;re trying to solve. It&#8217;ll have a target demographic about when we&#8217;re trying to do said thing, have a timeline, maybe important events that are happening around that time too. That then they kind of all compile it together to kind of create this kind of, it&#8217;s usually about five or six page long document that we can also then use to kind of go back to, to kind of make sure that whatever ideas we do come up that they fit the brief and they fit that target &#8230; clients. And they fit the platform that they asked us to create on. Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of a mix. A lot of it does come internally, but they definitely have to use findings and have these conversations with the clients to make sure that it&#8217;s good to go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, from what I heard, you were the first black woman hired there as a creative in the history of the agency. Is that true?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yes. So that&#8217;s actually pretty crazy. It&#8217;s pretty crazy considering I started in 2018, in the beginning of 2018. And I think I didn&#8217;t find that out probably at least a year and a half? A Year and a half maybe into my career here. But so it was kind of a shock. But I think also too, it was something that was also still really exciting. And I think that my friends and my parents, especially my mom, was trying to hype me up about, where initially I felt kind of scared. You know? You kind of feel worried like, &#8220;Oh okay, I don&#8217;t know if I really asked to be the first.&#8221; But something my mom always says is, &#8220;Well somebody has to be the first, so why can&#8217;t it be you?&#8221; So I think that things like that are also just so important when it comes to just kind of remembering your place. And then again, not take it as a negative, but just to know that like, &#8220;Hey, this is pretty exciting. We&#8217;re starting new things and somebody has to do it.&#8221; And all of us are more than capable in being that person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the brands or clients that you&#8217;ve been able to work with?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
When I first started out I primarily was working on Land O&#8217;Lakes Butter. So I know a lot of unnecessary facts about butter. Which is so funny with creatives and that&#8217;s why I love creatives, especially in the ad industry. Because everybody knows wild things about wild things, random things. It&#8217;s just so interesting. So I know a lot of things about butter, I worked on butter for almost a year. And then last year I did a lot of work for Discover Card, I&#8217;m a little knowledgeable actually in credit cards. So that&#8217;s kind of exciting. This year and at the end of last year too, I&#8217;ve been on more Oreo work, which has been fun and exciting. And then a lot of different other things. As we were pitching for Old Navy, I helped out with that some and that was really fun. And so many that they literally just have us go back and forth. I&#8217;m working on Penske now. I&#8217;ve done UPS. I&#8217;ve done Ritz Crackers, I&#8217;ve worked on that for a while.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
So, there&#8217;s definitely a lot of brands that I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to touch here, which has been fantastic. But then also too, we also just have a lot of cool brands too that I&#8217;m excited to hopefully touch this year, DoorDash and CarMax and things like that. So yeah, it just kind of changes and it&#8217;s nice because I&#8217;m never just on one thing. I&#8217;m usually on a few different things, so that, and I think especially when you have a mind that&#8217;s literally all over the place, it&#8217;s nice to be able to divert your energy into other paths rather than just one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there a specific type of client that you enjoy working with? Because I would imagine in an ad agency you&#8217;re working with, like you just mentioned all these different clients, they&#8217;re in all these different industries. There&#8217;s a lot of variety there.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah, there are. Yeah, there is. It&#8217;s interesting too because I think I find that, that almost changes sometimes. I think there&#8217;s been parts of every client that I&#8217;ve worked on so far that I really, really have enjoyed and I really, really liked. I think Oreo is really fun because they are kind of design heavy and I do love design and they also really love big ideas. So that&#8217;s kind of a really fun place to kind of come up with these larger ideas. But I think also too, I really love projects that use their platform to kind of spread a larger message. And I think that that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s really nice because it&#8217;s kind of few and far between. A lot of times people just want to make sure that their brand or their product is put, placed first, which I totally understand. But I think at the same time, I also love, love, love when a client can tap into an issue that is relatable for them and appropriate for them and they want to do something about it. And I think that that&#8217;s really fun and I think that&#8217;s what gets me most excited when I get, on [inaudible 00:08:52] like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I have to ask this question because you&#8217;ve spent a lot of time talking about really sort of kind of the great things about your job and what it is that you do, but what&#8217;s the worst thing about being an art director in an agency?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I would say the worst thing would probably, honestly and I think you can ask any art director this, I&#8217;m pretty sure they&#8217;ll say the same thing. I think the death of every art director is making comps and making comps is literally just the art of basically intense hours of photoshopping and searching for images. And let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve come up with this grand idea, you said, &#8220;Okay, we want to make a truck that has a slide on the back of it.&#8221; And of course every client is just like, &#8220;Okay, I don&#8217;t know what that means. Can we see what that looks like?&#8221; So again, that&#8217;s our job so now we have to find a truck, I&#8217;m going on Getty and search all these things and find the perfect truck then photoshop that truck to make it Oreo branded, let&#8217;s say. And then put a giant, and then find another image of a slide that still fits and then still have it look somewhat realistic.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
So, I think that part can just be just such a time consuming thing because you can search for pictures for hours and you can get stuck in this hole for hours. And so I think that that might be the most difficult part, because how can you move fast but then also make something look as nice. So I think that that&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve really been working on this year too, is just my speed but then also to my craft and making sure that those two things go together. So, that can just be a little time consuming. But like I said, I think a lot of art directors can feel my pain when it comes to making comps.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So when you&#8217;re working together with the copywriter, are there, it sounds like you&#8217;re also kind of the designer too. There&#8217;s not designers that are in house that are helping out or you&#8217;re kind of?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yes. We definitely, we have a whole super, super talented design team and we also have a very super, super talented studio art team. The studio art, so that&#8217;s a group of people that will more so be the ones to kind of help us with those comps and kind of help us get things together and make sure the images are perfect and the files are perfect before they send them off to be shipped to whomever. And then our designers are more so, they&#8217;ll kind of sit in concept with us sometimes. So sometimes they&#8217;ll even be in the brief if it&#8217;s big enough, they&#8217;ll be in the brief with us and so then they know that they&#8217;re kind of concepting and thinking about it design-wise. Whereas we&#8217;re kind of focused on still the imagery, but also too the core of the idea. That&#8217;s still a big part of our job description as well. So we still have people who can help us out, but nine times out of 10 they have to kind of, they still have plenty of things they have to do on their own. So it&#8217;s just, I think as an art director you kind of have to be multifaceted. But I think a great art director is also a great designer and vice versa. So, it&#8217;s an interesting role because it kind of dips into a bunch of different things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was design kind of a big part of your childhood? Growing up, you grew up in Milwaukee from what you told me before we started recording. Was design kind of a big part of you growing up?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
So, you know what? Not necessarily design but more so just art. It&#8217;s interesting because, so I&#8217;m the oldest of five and both of my parents are super smart. My dad is an engineer. My mom has always been great at math and science and so I feel I came out and I was just this little, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s draw.&#8221; I just always felt, &#8220;Wait, what happened? How did I not get that gene?&#8221; But it&#8217;s fine. I think what&#8217;s interesting too is, now that I actually sitting here and talking about it, I think because of my dad&#8217;s job, we moved around quite a bit. And by moving around, we&#8217;ve probably moved around almost every three years. So, I was constantly going to new schools in new states and trying to, I was always the new kid, but I think I found comfort in art. I think that was something that wasn&#8217;t reliant upon somebody else. So if I were to move that summer or something, I could still draw, it was something that still keep me occupied. It was something that I really enjoyed, seeing a picture and then trying to, then bring it.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Seeing a picture and then trying to then bring it to paper. So that was something I think kind of like that all kids do. But then I noticed that that was one thing that I really kept with. So I kept with it throughout middle school, I kept with it throughout high school, I even kept with it through, actually, through college, which I had then realized like, &#8220;Oh, maybe I should have majored in art. Maybe this should&#8217;ve been a thing.&#8221; But I still took, like I literally took an art class every single semester and there&#8217;s only one semester I did it and I literally could feel the difference. I just didn&#8217;t feel the same. So that&#8217;s when I realized, &#8220;Okay, like this is probably going to be a part of me forever.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Were your parents kind of really supportive of you going into art, like that?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
They were. They were and I thank them all the time and I&#8217;m just so appreciative. They&#8217;ve always been super understanding. They&#8217;ve always been very supportive in that, and so I always say it. Before I left or right after I had graduated from Hampton, I had gotten a degree in Public Relations, which I still really liked. But you know, I just, I don&#8217;t know, there was something about it where I was just like, &#8220;Okay,&#8221; I basically made a deal with myself. I said, &#8220;Okay, so I&#8217;m job hunting. You know, I&#8217;m looking for a PR job but I&#8217;m going to take art classes on the side because I think that that&#8217;s something really important to me.&#8221; So I was looking for jobs in different cities and I lived in Atlanta and so, of course, I was probably looking up the art schools before I was looking up the jobs, but &#8230; so that tells you a lot right there but &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I found through a Google search, I was like looking through like art school and then up popped up two different things. It was the Portfolio Center and then the Creative Circus. And I remember reading through, because as I was doing like the job search or like as I was looking at like descriptions for the PR jobs, it was interesting because art director would never be that far because it&#8217;s still all in communications. And so I would always see that job position, that job role and I was just like, &#8220;Wow, that sounds so cool. It literally sounds right up my alley, but I don&#8217;t know how would I become an art director? That doesn&#8217;t make any sense.&#8221; And like, &#8220;That&#8217;s really cool. I don&#8217;t know how people get into it, but whatever.&#8221; Once I found the Circus I was looking through and it was basically, I was just like, &#8220;Oh, so this is a two year program where I could learn how to be an art director.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I said, &#8220;That sounds lit. That&#8217;s exactly what I want to do,&#8221; and so I remember I had like, I found it, I thought about it, like I prayed on it and I sent my parents this really long text one morning. I was just like, &#8220;Hey, I found this school. I know I wasn&#8217;t planning to go right back to school, but I found this school. I&#8217;m in Atlanta and I can study as an art director there. And I think that like, I think it&#8217;s legit. Like I think this is something I really want to do. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m really interested in. What do you guys think basically?&#8221; And they were just like, I mean, &#8220;Okay, crazy girl.&#8221; They&#8217;re just like, that&#8217;s fine.&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
So like I was like, I was the one who was like really stressed, like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, like hopefully they&#8217;ll be okay with it. X, Y, and Z.&#8221; They were like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s fine. Like, sure why not?&#8221; And so for that, I&#8217;m very thankful because I just know it&#8217;s hard. I think it&#8217;s hard really for anyone to kind of tell like their parents and stuff, especially after we just spent all this money at a four year university that, &#8220;Hey, I want to go to a portfolio school where, you know, also mind you, you don&#8217;t get a degree in.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
&#8220;You, more so, just get a certificate,&#8221; and it&#8217;s kind of crazy. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, so we&#8217;re about to put some more money back into schooling that you technically don&#8217;t get another degree in.&#8221; But I was trying to explain the importance. I was just like, &#8220;Well, look, like still like there&#8217;s like a 99% placement, 95, 99% placement rate after graduation. I think it&#8217;ll be great.&#8221; So yeah, they helped ride that wave with me ever since then and even before and still now. So for that, I&#8217;m very grateful. I know that that&#8217;s very much so a privileged that I don&#8217;t take lightly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I want to go back to the Creative Circus, but even before then you kind of glossed a little bit over the fact that you went to such a prestigious HBCU for undergrad. You went to Hampton University.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah. Those were some of the best years of my life so far. I think that&#8217;s where Ashley came to be Ashley. I think I had grown up in predominantly white institutions and places and schools. My mom was the one who actually really pushed for that. She was very adamant and &#8220;Hey, I know that, like, obviously, like we couldn&#8217;t help like by school district with so much like while you were in high school and stuff,&#8221; but she was like, &#8220;If you decide to go to HBCU, just know that this is probably one of the only times in your life you&#8217;ll be surrounded by so many beautifully educated brown and black people who look just like you and you just won&#8217;t necessarily get that opportunity anywhere else.&#8221; And the more I thought about it, it was interesting. I was a little nervous because I was actually going into the Hampton, I was worried that maybe I wasn&#8217;t &#8220;black enough.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
You know, I didn&#8217;t necessarily have a lot of black friends growing up and I technically wasn&#8217;t in all those spaces and necessarily didn&#8217;t know all the music and things like that. Of course, I was still like with my family and stuff, but you know, it&#8217;s still not the same if you don&#8217;t have like a core group of friends and stuff in high school and things like that. So it just wasn&#8217;t the same. And so I was a little worried about that, but honestly it turned out that there were a lot of Ashleys at Hampton and it was fantastic. And I think I wasn&#8217;t the only one who felt that way, but that fear was just a projected fear that I had. It was never anything that actually happened. There was still a place for me as there was a place to someone who grew up in all black schools their entire life.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I feel like that kind of flowing into Hampton was more, way more seamless than I thought it would be. But yeah, Hampton was an incredible experience. I have lifelong friends from there. I have bridesmaids, I have probably maid of honors, like I just have some of my best friends I&#8217;ll have for the rest of my life. I just love also, too, I think also, too, I came into terms of also celebrating just who I am and also being black and like how much, like how much power there is in that. And so Hampton taught me a lot of that as well. And so that&#8217;s really exciting and it&#8217;s interesting, too, it even transcended into some of my art, too. I notice growing up I actually drew more white women, more people who probably weren&#8217;t of a black ethnicity. It was interesting to kind of see how my sketchbooks have changed, too, by just being introduced into that.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
And then also like again, it&#8217;s important to know like &#8230; Well, it&#8217;s important as a child, even just growing up as a teenager, what you see and what your perception is on things and how much that affects you. But it was crazy how that was affecting my art and how I never really drew girls that necessarily looked like me, but now like if you asked me today like that&#8217;s all I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s very, very, very interesting to see how just that influence that I think that I had [inaudible 00:06:55]. I think that that was probably the best decision I could&#8217;ve made. And that&#8217;s one of the best decisions I&#8217;ve made. Like flat out, in my 26 years or so.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You make an interesting point there about HBCUs. I mean, so I went to an HBCU also. I went to Morehouse and HBCUs in general are &#8230; I mean maybe this is just us speaking as black people, like they&#8217;re very warm, comforting open spaces for everyone.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if people that maybe don&#8217;t know the HBCU experience or just aren&#8217;t familiar with HBCUs in general really see that. But like it&#8217;s such a unique sort of family thing. I think one just among students and alums at a particular school, but also between HBCU graduate students and alums of other schools. Like we see like a certain kinship in other people that have went to HBCU. I don&#8217;t know if that, if that kind of makes sense or not, but, no. Essentially because you said your mom kind of really wanted you to go there to sort of soak up that culture. I&#8217;m curious to know like because Hampton has such a well known design program, I mean we&#8217;ve had several people on the show who have graduated from Hampton that went on to graduate school. Actually, you mentioned the Creative Circus, nikita Pope, she&#8217;s a Hampton grad. What was the program like there for you? Like did you feel like it really prepared you once you got out there as a working art director? As a working designer?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah, so I think what&#8217;s interesting is I think as most &#8230; Well, I was 17, 18 year old going into college, I think I knew that I wanted to be kind of creative. I knew I liked things that were more like thinking based than creation based, but I don&#8217;t think I ever really knew how to fully get into it. And so with that being said, I think some of that, it was also, too, of my own misunderstanding and kind of almost like canceling it out completely. Whereas I think maybe I probably in those four years, I look back now and I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Man, I wish I would&#8217;ve learned Photoshop and Illustrator and Adobe Suite during Hampton rather than trying to learn it at the Circus.&#8221; And so I think that was almost kind of my misstep in like not maybe taking full advantage of all the programs that were there currently in Hampton as I was kind of more so just focused on like just fine art and just drawing and painting and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
So looking back I&#8217;m just kind of like, &#8220;Man, if I would have only really known that like I could have done this and then went here and then that would&#8217;ve made sense then I think I absolutely would&#8217;ve set it up that way.&#8221; But I think, I know it&#8217;s not just me. I know it&#8217;s a lot of people. I think it&#8217;s just like you realize and you&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Oh, shoot, this was an option and this was a path.&#8221; And like looking back I definitely would have done some things differently as far as like my track and kind of like my major, definitely my minor. I think that they have a great solid program and I do have friends and I do know people who have successfully gone through the program, but they&#8217;re doing great now still, too. I just think I just wasn&#8217;t like for sure, for sure just yet, while I was at Hampton. It just wasn&#8217;t able to fully tap into all the resources.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think that&#8217;s probably like, I don&#8217;t want to say a regret, but I feel like that&#8217;s a regret for &#8230; Sometimes I think for people that are at schools, they don&#8217;t feel like they&#8217;ve gotten a chance to really utilize all the resources. It&#8217;s sort of one of those, you know, hindsight, this 20-20 kind of things. You look back and realize how good you had it in a way. But I mean what you learned at Hampton though at least kind of propelled you forward to then go to the Creative Circus.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Oh, yeah, absolutely. And I think also through Hampton, I think that also, one of big &#8230; Well, a really big takeaway that I got from Hampton is learning how to just work with people and learning to really come into your own. I think I feel like that that was almost like, I think college in general, it just, it comes at the right time and then always feels like it ends too early. But I&#8217;m sure that it ends right on time, but it definitely prepared me to work with people and professionalism and kind of again, like you were mentioning earlier about that sense of community that now I carry into when it comes to, here amongst all the employees here, Martin, but also especially our black employee network.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s something that I really lean into hard because I think it reminds me so much of Hampton. So it&#8217;s something that I really kind of latch onto and really try to kind of just, I don&#8217;t know, just really attach myself to, because it really feels like home.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So when you ended up going to the Circus and you were here in Atlanta, I&#8217;m curious like what was that time like for you? Because Creative Circus, I&#8217;m thinking, I&#8217;m sort of trying to line it up. So this is like between 2015 to 2017 what was that time like in Atlanta for you?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Atlanta was a great time. So it was interesting because Atlanta necessarily wasn&#8217;t in one of my cities to live necessarily. But I realized that I had really made a home out of Atlanta by the time I &#8230; like those two years were up and I miss it almost every day. But I think my time there was just such a whirlwind, was probably the best way to explain it? It was like anything I&#8217;ve never, like I&#8217;ve ever experienced before. It was just, I just call it, it was just like this crazy two-year bootcamp, I felt like.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Because the Circus is also set up by quarters, so it&#8217;s pretty much year round, and so that was something new. I think also too, that&#8217;s the biggest city that I lived in and I lived in my own. Also, too, kind of just going off a whim and doing something that I personally did never knew of anybody doing before and kind of leaping out to take that chance was also really scary. And so I think, what I was like 22, I think I&#8217;d just turned 23 the day before my first day of class. And it was just a crazy time. But again, like that was just another time where I learned so much and I got to be just so creative and that&#8217;s something else, too, that I miss. There were like, there were barely any restrict</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
&#8230; that&#8217;s something also too that I missed. There were barely any restrictions. There were barely any like, &#8220;Oh we can&#8217;t do that or you can&#8217;t use those colors. You can do that.&#8221; Like everything was open for grabs. There was time to actually do things and even as rushed and as stressed and as busy as we were because we were all those things all the time for those whole two years. At the same time, I think that I still made incredible, incredible friendships and experiences that like, again, kind of like the Hampton, I think that that play in my life will stay with me forever too. I think that that was such a big, important time as far as my career development and also my development as a creative.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I really think that that was also the time that I really fell in love with design and digital design and graphic design and digital art and how to transfer my traditional skills and kind of put it more into like this modern day age. So it was like this big squirrel, but it was fantastic. And again, I think that that was also a great choice that I&#8217;m very happy I did.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now when you look back over your career, look back over your education et cetera. Who are some of the people that have really helped motivate and inspire you throughout the years?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah. So I think a lot of times when I think about those people, a lot of times they are just people who have just been just kind. And a lot of times it&#8217;s friends, it&#8217;s family, everybody in between. So I would say that first off, of course my family is always super supportive, always have been day one, very thankful. Then I feel like I had my Hampton core group friends, they were always so supportive. I would call them in tears or super stressed out about a project and they would always pick up the phone, always be encouraging like, &#8220;Hey, we don&#8217;t really understand 100% but we know that you&#8217;re doing the right thing. So just keep going.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
And then as I got to the circumstance stuff, I&#8217;ve met amazing creatives who are just all like just fantastic. And so I&#8217;m learning from them every day. And it&#8217;s really nice to also go through this journey at the same time with them and hearing similar stories. And I think that that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s more empowering that I think people may not realize, but having a group of people who are doing similar or pretty much the same thing as you but different places, it&#8217;s really cool to see us all grow all over the country. I have some really fantastic, fantastic coworkers who have now turned to friends who have now turned to family. And a lot of those people here at Martin, they are like brothers and sisters. They are like big brothers and sisters. They&#8217;re mentors. And I just am so thankful for all of them and I think that they are really single-handedly helping me navigate my career, which is priceless.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I just learned so much from each and every one of them and I&#8217;m so thankful for their presence. But I think it takes a village and it&#8217;s been taken a village. So there&#8217;s a ton of people that I feel like I&#8217;ve been blessed with that can help me out with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project that you&#8217;d love to work on one day?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yes, I feel like I&#8217;m not 100% sure what that is, but as far as like a name, I think my dream project would be visually stunning, very well designed. And then also too it would be for a bigger cause. It would either be for like a nonprofit, it would be either some kind of announcement. I&#8217;ve also always dreamed in maybe doing design or art direction for an art museum. Even like I&#8217;ve also been watching a lot of music videos lately. Low key I would love to art direct a music video. And then two, I think also my dream is to work on a movie one day.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
It kind of like it spans, it can be anything from like a book, like a very beautifully like well art directed well laid out books all the way to helping out to say that I was able to help out with even like a Pixar film if I could. Like be in the room to help out with like art direction or color or things like that. Things like that just really get me excited and those kind of projects too I think would help also to remind me of why I love my job in the first place and it all comes back to being able to make something and I think that that&#8217;s what I love the most is just physically making something and that&#8217;s why I love being an art director. I love coming up with ideas but also really, really love making things. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I have to ask since you mentioned a music video, which artist would you work with?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I mean obviously I love Beyonc√©. I would do anything she would ever ask me to do. In drop of a dime if she called me right now, I would run to LA or wherever she&#8217;s at, but there are some really, really, really cool artists out here that I really love. So I recently watched &#8230; I believe her name is Victoria Mon√©t. She just had a music video drop for her new song Moment and visually it&#8217;s beautiful. She did such an amazing job. Her art direction is fantastic. Like things like that I would absolutely work with her in a heartbeat.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
And also too, I&#8217;ve been watching a lot of Brent Faiyaz. He also has some really cool artsy and kind of grungy art direction, which I would also be very into. And obviously Solange also does a great job. There&#8217;s just a few different ones. And then even too, people I would also say don&#8217;t sleep on even some of the rappers like Playboi Carti, he also does a great job as far as like his editing team, kind of like I love the effort that&#8217;s being put behind a lot of these music videos. They&#8217;re just so visually engaging.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s just interesting because we don&#8217;t necessarily have that like 106 apart or MTV playing music videos all the time. You kind of have to go out of your way to kind of watch them. But I love that we&#8217;re still putting the effort behind them even if we&#8217;re not being watched all the time. You think that that would kind of die off, and in some aspects it has. And I think people that&#8217;s why maybe we don&#8217;t even have as many music videos on a consistent basis than we think we should. But I think I love music so much. And so to be able to tell a story within a song, I think that that would just be such a fun challenge and you can take that story so many different ways as people do and find meaning and find purpose for everything. But I think that that would be something really, really fun to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I am seeing how the music videos now for certain artists are certainly, it&#8217;s bringing me back to like the Heyday of the 90s when we had like Hype Williams video that you had like really dope videos by Missy and everything and it&#8217;s like you get so in throbbing. Of course you love the song, but then visuals along with the song, it makes each video like an event of sorts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like we have to really give it up to Michael Jackson for making videos releases and events like a prime time of it that people used to tune into. I remember as a kid tuning into watch Black or White or tuning into watch Remember The Time, but like yeah, now you really kind of don&#8217;t see that. It feels like the big thing now is the surprise drop. I mean like Beyonc√© did it of course. And now everyone else is trying to find some way to get your attention really quickly. So it&#8217;s not only, yes, we want you to look at the video and consume the music. But it&#8217;s really about gathering your attention for a period of time.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah. And similar to how you felt like that. That&#8217;s how I felt in Atlanta when she dropped Lemonade. I vividly remember that night and I went over to my friend&#8217;s house saw that at HBO, we&#8217;d all brought stuff to eat and watch and I just remember just texting my mom like, &#8220;Oh my God, do you see this?&#8221; I think that that was fantastic. I think that also just goes to show the true craft and then like again that wanting to make something. Again, this is nothing she ever like necessarily had to do, but I think a lot of it for her and just like Michael, I think it&#8217;s that wanting to tell that story and go that extra step.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Like yes, I made the song and yes I made the lyrics and I have to sing and perform it, but now it&#8217;s just like I want to bring it to life visually. And I think that that&#8217;s really, really exciting. And I think you don&#8217;t see that necessarily all the time. But all that to say too is like Lemonade, like that was an event and I just don&#8217;t remember the last music video since then. That has really felt like an event. I don&#8217;t know. Like I feel like my memory might be a little jog right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I think you might be right. Videos come out all the time, but it&#8217;s like they get shared on Twitter or something and you watch a vivo link, and you&#8217;re like, okay, then you go about your day. Like it&#8217;s not really something that you really are tuned in for or anticipated seeing. Because for the artists they want to surprise you with it. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, surprise. I put out a new music video.&#8221; And you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, okay.&#8221; And you watch it and then that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah, I know. I know. And that&#8217;s why I think her idea of like a visual album was fantastic. And then to also see all the songs coming to life from one bigger story, which I think also too, a lot of that just goes back to storytelling and the art of doing that, which is really fun. Whether you&#8217;re telling your own story or you&#8217;re entrusted to share someone else&#8217;s story. I think there&#8217;s a lot of power and there&#8217;s a lot of connectiveness that comes in being able to kind of bring those words and those experiences to life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I think we&#8217;re also fortunate to be at a time where the technology is also accessible enough where you don&#8217;t necessarily have to have the huge studio and the crew and everything. I mean people are shooting great music videos on iPhones with gimbals, like the tech and the hardware, I should say, has gotten a lot more accessible for more people to really kind of get into it.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Right. Yeah, exactly. It is really cool to see how quickly things move every day. And I know people talk about that all the time, but really things move so fast and so it&#8217;s just like you&#8217;re just trying to ride away. I would say 15 seconds, but I feel like it&#8217;s less than that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It is now. I mean you&#8217;re starting to see artists that are like &#8230; Actually I read this article and I&#8217;m sort of plugging work here for a minute, but I read this article on Glimmer, which is my employer&#8217;s glitch, but we have a lifestyle publication called Glimmer and one of the recent articles is about how artists manipulates their songs and their DJ system makes sure that they&#8217;re getting like the maximum out of streams and everything like that. So it almost feels like the music is not in as much about expression as much as it is about just charting or getting numbers, reaching some like arbitrary success metric.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s good that you have the artists that are sort of outside of that, that are more interested in creating experiences. Like you mentioned Solange, you mentioned Beyonc√©, I think Janelle Mon√°e is like another artist that tries to do that. Like just tries to elevate what she&#8217;s doing past just a track or an EP. She wants to make it like an experience.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Exactly. It&#8217;s artists like that I really latch onto and I really respect them and their path because I think that that&#8217;s just like the definition of a true artist. Like you just legitimately want to make something for the sake of making it and expressing yourself. And I think that that&#8217;s so exciting. And also too, especially when you do a despite, maybe low views, may or may not help streams or whatever. I feel like in this day and age, if you&#8217;re really taking the time for music videos, a lot of times you&#8217;re just doing it out of artistry, which I respect. Especially really, really nicely well. Not just also like we&#8217;re just blowing this giant budget we have, getting this quarter of a million, million dollar budget. But outside of that we&#8217;re actually using it to actually sit down and craft a story. Those are the artists I respect the most.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you wish you would&#8217;ve been told about the advertising industry when you first started?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I wish I would&#8217;ve known how quickly things move. And how things, things as far as like projects almost do like making me here today and gone tomorrow. It&#8217;s such an interesting thing and it&#8217;s such an interesting career choice because you are investing yourself. So like creatively and kind of like emotionally a little bit and mentally can be very straining and physically you can be very tired. So you&#8217;re just putting in all this energy-</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Basically you can be very tired, so you&#8217;re just putting in all this energy, and then into a thing that&#8217;s not even necessarily always for certain. So projects can still fall through. [inaudible 00:39:12] can be like, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re not going to do this.&#8221; Or they can be like, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re going to hold this for later. Oh, well, we don&#8217;t have the resources to do that right now, so we&#8217;re going to go ahead and table it.&#8221; There&#8217;s just so many factors that go into everything and way more factors than I think that people realize.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Every time you see a really good commercial on TV now, I actually applaud it and I respect it because there are just so many factors that played into having great work get out there. So it&#8217;s just kind of hard. But that&#8217;s something I really respect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you make time for joy?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I make time for joy by, I think keeping to the things that I still want to do, regardless. I&#8217;ve learned that this job can be very stressful and there can be a lot of projected stress. It can be very rush, rush, rush, this, this, this. But I think what gives me joy at the end of the day, and when I go home and I go to sleep, is just my relationships with people and my friendships with people, and knowing how much those matter to me.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
So what brings me joy, I think, is doing whatever I can to maintain those, and to commit myself or be committed to still honoring the things that I still love to do on the side and actively making time for those things. So it can be kind of tough when you feel like you&#8217;re super swamped, and you have a lot of things going on, and a lot of projects, but I think it&#8217;s possible just with a little planning. A lot of things are possible with just like, &#8220;Okay, well let me move these things around so I can have some space.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
And I also too, I think what I&#8217;ve been realizing lately, is just sometimes it&#8217;s solitude and sometimes it&#8217;s also just taking a step back and just finding joy and peace in also replenishing yourself. I think a lot of times too, we weigh outcomes, we define ourselves by the outcomes of our project. A lot of times, a lot, a lot, a lot of times, it&#8217;s because something fell through. A lot of times it&#8217;s not our fault, it&#8217;s just external factors. So I think it&#8217;s important for me to also find your way into other things, that I feel like maybe I do find more control in and putting more of my, some of that same, maybe not more, but at least some of that same energy that I put into for work things, that I will still put in for things like my side project, or if I want to just have a, I call them paint parties. My paint parties, it&#8217;s just me painting on my floor by myself.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
So overall though, I really do think that there&#8217;s joy all around us. I think it&#8217;s just our &#8230; Sometimes it can kind of feel scheduled or kind of like a responsibility. But in living in a world where things are so crazy, and things do move around so fast, and things get rescheduled, and this, that, [inaudible 00:02:58], you&#8217;re trying to keep up with things, I just feel like, &#8220;Well, hey, if I have to schedule time for me to [inaudible 00:42:03].&#8221; And if I put on my calendar, &#8216;Go have fun&#8217; then that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do. But I find joy in my friends, and also, I find a lot of joy going to concerts too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I love seeing live music, so that&#8217;s something that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever get tired of, so I&#8217;m always at somebody&#8217;s concert. That&#8217;s something I plan to keep up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to somebody that wants to break into the ad industry today?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I would say, &#8220;Okay, cool. I&#8217;m glad that &#8230; I&#8217;m so happy that you&#8217;ve seen and considered this as an option.&#8221; I think that there are resources, and I think also too, it&#8217;s interesting now because I feel like the game is really changing as far as the way that recruiting is going. I think agencies, even Martin, is researching and finding new ways to recruit and find talent. It&#8217;s interesting, a lot of times it almost always felt like this secret almost. It&#8217;s just like, &#8220;How do you get into that? How do you do it?&#8221; But I think agencies are now trying harder to be more present, be more present at places like HBCUs, to go to more to a whole plethora of high schools and middle schools, to career fairs, which I&#8217;ve been to both and I&#8217;m helping with those efforts. Something that I&#8217;m also very passionate about.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
But I think that it&#8217;s definitely possible. I think if able, I think portfolio schools are a great, great, great in, a great in to the ad agency life. They really are a great pipeline to get in the door. But outside of that, just really tapping into those creative strengths, working on your craft and your skill, and then just feeling confident in concepting and coming up with ideas.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
But what&#8217;s lovely about ad agencies too, is what we tell everybody, is that there is usually a place for every type of person here, even if it&#8217;s not in creative. There&#8217;s usually some kind of space that everyone fits into. And so with that being said, I think it&#8217;s just so viable and it&#8217;s just, again, even if you&#8217;re not in [inaudible 00:44:10] department, I think there&#8217;s something to be said to be around so much creative energy and be in such a flexible environment. I really truly think, and I know a lot of people out there to feel the same way.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
But I feel like this is legitimately what I need. I feel like &#8230; I always tell people too, &#8220;In your heart of hearts, if you feel like you&#8217;re meant to do something, you might as well just start now because you&#8217;re going to end up doing it anyways because it&#8217;s not going to go away.&#8221; So, it&#8217;s just like, &#8220;All right, well if I&#8217;m able to start now, let&#8217;s just start now.&#8221; So yeah, but there&#8217;s a place literally for everyone and I think that&#8217;s what I love most about my job. Nobody, no two people, come from the same background or the same [inaudible 00:44:51]. It&#8217;s just different. But there&#8217;s all these different people but they all have a space, and so I think that that&#8217;s something to be said.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? Like it&#8217;s 2025, what kind of work are you doing or working on?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
2025, at that point I feel like there&#8217;s probably a good chance I&#8217;ll probably be either in New York or LA. I would be working on some really, really cool, potentially lifestyle-esque brands. Whether that be like a Target, or do an interesting media company, like a Refinery29, or potentially even maybe even trying out what it&#8217;s like to be an art director at a magazine company like Elle or Ebony or any of those. And am I able to still empower people there too?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I&#8217;m excited because I think by then my creativity will have branched out to something that&#8217;s still art direction, but I think might be a little different. And so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to figure out now, is what is it? I know I love creating, I know I love making things, but what are other ways I can also explore that too? And I also too, maybe I&#8217;ll have a side project by then that&#8217;ll just blow up, and then I can just be an entrepreneur for the rest of my life. You just never know and it&#8217;s just really exciting. But there&#8217;s so many opportunities to be creative but in different ways. So I&#8217;m excited to really explore those out in the next five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
My portfolio, which I&#8217;m working on updating currently, my portfolio is ashleybozeman.com. So A-S-H-L-E-Y B-O-Z-E-M-A-N.com. And then my Instagram is @AshleyCierraa. So A-S-H-L-E-Y C-I-E-R-R-A-A. So those are the two places that I am the most, especially Instagram, but I&#8217;m usually always around.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
I&#8217;m always down, I always answer almost every DM. Or if anybody who ever wants to chat or has any questions too about just getting started, that&#8217;s something I love to do. And I love to get people excited and just talk about it as a career. But I love to help out in any way that I can. I think that it&#8217;s so important to still reach back. And I know that I&#8217;ve only been doing this for two years, but if there&#8217;s some way I can help, I definitely will.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. All right, well Ashley Bozeman, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you really for sharing your story about what it&#8217;s like being a young black woman working in the advertising industry, and then also sharing the things that inspire you. We have people, I think really of all ages, that are listening to this show. We&#8217;ve got students, we&#8217;ve got captains of industry, et cetera, and we try to hit just a lot of different points of creativity and design and everything. So it&#8217;s always good to hear from the perspective of someone that&#8217;s, I wouldn&#8217;t say just starting out in it, but you&#8217;ve been in it for a while now.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah. But basically, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, but I mean to get the perspective of what is it like for you now at this stage? I mean, 2020 for all intents and purposes, is the future, in a lot of ways.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Yeah, I know. It&#8217;s scary.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, and I mean it&#8217;s good to know that you&#8217;re at a position where you&#8217;re able to craft the images that a lot of people see when it comes to representation for a number of different brands and companies, et cetera. That&#8217;s a really big mantle to hold. So it sounds like definitely you have the creativity and the skills to make it happen, and I&#8217;m going to be really interested to see what you work on in the future. So thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Bozeman:</b><br>
Oh, my God. Thank you so much for having me. This has been fantastic. It was lovely to talk to you and yeah, just thank you so much for having me on this platform, and hopefully that this&#8217;ll help or inspire someone else.</p>

<p>One thing I love about what Nakita M. Pope does is that she takes complex concepts and makes them simple and easy for anyone to understand. As a designer, brand strategist, and Chief Chick of her own studio <a href="http://www.brandingchicks.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Branding Chicks</a>, Nakita has helped transform the lives of her clients for over 15 years!</p>
<p>We started off by looking at how she started her boutique branding studio, talked about her work as a design educator at <a href="https://creativecircus.edu/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The Creative Circus</a>, and touched on her educational journey from Hampton University to The Portfolio Center to now. Nakita also shared some great resources for any designer looking to get more into design strategy. For Nakita, creativity is more than just business &#8212; it&#8217;s a way of life!</p>
