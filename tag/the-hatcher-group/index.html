Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>If you&#8217;re in the know about the DC design scene, then this week&#8217;s guest probably needs no introduction. Reece Qui√±ones is a force for good when it comes to design, whether it&#8217;s in her role at The Hatcher Group as executive VP and creative director, or by teaching the next generation of designers as an adjunct professor at George Mason University. And she doesn&#8217;t stop there!</p>
<p>Reece talked to me about an average day for her at The Hatcher Group, and talked about growing up in DC and being exposed to architecture and art at a young age. She also spoke on her work experiences before The Hatcher Group, and gave some great perspective about being a long-time design educator, including what she feels design students want from the design industry these days. As a designer, you can never stop learning, and Reece Qui√±ones is a prime example of how you can use your skills to give back to your community!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Hello. My name is Reece Qui√±ones, and I&#8217;m the Executive Vice President and Senior Creative Director for Hatcher, a PR marketing and design firm in the DC area. I&#8217;m also an Adjunct Professor of Design at George Mason University located in Fairfax, Virginia.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been great. Very, very busy. We ended 2021 with a bang, and I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s almost the end of January already. It just seems like it&#8217;s flying by, but it&#8217;s been very good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. You and I talked about this before recording, but it seems like the year started and there was no kind of ramping up into anything. Everyone just kind of got to work, which usually I don&#8217;t mind that, but it has been a very busy month so far.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Yes, it has. It has been busy, and I think we&#8217;ve been two years into the pandemic, so there&#8217;s a lot of fatigue out there too. So with everything, with the work continuing to ramp up, with everyone feeling really comfortable with this telework, it just seems there&#8217;s a lot of pressure. There&#8217;s a lot of pressure to still perform as companies are starting to think about how they&#8217;re going to return back to the office. I think a lot of people are really trying to say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m good here.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, we&#8217;re at this, I think really interesting shift in, I want to say it&#8217;s uniquely American, but it&#8217;s really something that&#8217;s happening worldwide. But I mean, we&#8217;re in America, you and I. So I think it affects Americans differently because we have such a symbiotic relationship with work. So the fact that there are going to see these large structures around capitalism and work that have been upended because of the pandemic, companies are trying to see if hybrid is a good deal, if they should still stay remote. They&#8217;re selling office spaces, they&#8217;re buy more office spaces. Companies are really trying to figure out what&#8217;s next, and I think it&#8217;s difficult for them. But then also with workers, we&#8217;re realizing in general that the work is always going to be there, that we have more power as workers than we thought, and so we can advocate for greater, better work experiences. So this is a really transformative time overall.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I think so too. I think Hatcher has done a really great job. They just went flexible first. Meaning if you want to work from home, you can. If you want to work in the office, you can. And if you want to do both, you can. And just really looking at that, I think has been really something that has kept people in the office and just really just love the culture that we&#8217;ve created there. So I&#8217;m just happy that we were able to move forward with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right now, are you able to go back into the office or you&#8217;re still kind of doing things remotely?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
We can if we want to, but most people are remote, and it&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does a average day look like?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
It&#8217;s busy. One of the things that we really worked on during the pandemic when we just immediately switched over to working from home just one day to the next&#8230; I was telling you a little bit earlier, I was the only holdout. I thought for some reason that it would only last a week and then I realized like, &#8220;Oh, wait, I don&#8217;t think this is going to last a week.&#8221; I went back to the office to get my chair, to get my desktop computer and all the things that I needed. But one of the things that we really worked on is communication. So work at Hatcher is really just this wonderful realm. My team in the morning, we always jump on chat. We say, good morning like you would if you just came in the office. This morning, one of my designers saved a dog that was kind of limping in the street and we were hearing about it. The play by play, but that&#8217;s the wonderful thing about it. So we have kept a wonderful relationship. That&#8217;s always really good.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
It&#8217;s really busy. The way I form my team is really in a way that everybody can grow in the way they want to grow. So as a part of their goals, they say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m more interested in DesignOps. Can I move in that role?&#8221; Or, &#8220;I&#8217;m really interested in becoming an art director? Can I move in that role?&#8221; So I try to ensure that all of my designers have the ability to learn from each other and to learn different types of design. So if I have somebody that&#8217;s mostly print that wants to learn UX, they can do that.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Yeah, just a really busy day. We have a great team of production that just keeps the trains moving. I have three art directors that help to ensure that the work looks great. In my senior creative role, I can normally formulate the strategy and just look at high-level creative. But it&#8217;s a busy day full of meetings, but it&#8217;s also one that&#8217;s really exciting and we&#8217;re able to really do some amazing things with amazing clients.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s really great that people are able to be flexible on the team like that. If there&#8217;s other things that they want to get into, they can do that, particularly I think within an agency kind of framework. I&#8217;ve worked largely with startups over the past five years and with those, it can be easy to just bounce from thing to thing because they maybe haven&#8217;t built out a robust network of people that work there yet. It&#8217;s mostly engineers, they may not have that much on creative. So if you want to jump into doing something else, you can just say, &#8220;I want to do something else,&#8221; and you can do it. With firms, it seems like it&#8217;s a bit more regimented because you&#8217;ve got creative directors and art directors and production designers, et cetera. But it sounds like it&#8217;s pretty flexible at Hatcher.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
It is. It&#8217;s really important to me because I realized as I was coming up, the integration of design was really important. I know you remember a day that when there was a job description, they wanted everything like, &#8220;Oh, are you a website designer? Can you do print? Can you do this? Can you do that?&#8221; And we&#8217;re all looking at each other like, &#8220;Come on, really? What do you want?&#8221; So I did. I learned all those things. So over the years, I did UX, I did product design, I&#8217;ve done marketing communications design, advertising, environmental design, digital. So you&#8217;ve done all of it, and I realized that it really encapsulates the importance of design. That the foundational thing that you need to always know about design is basically that good design can transcend whatever medium.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So you need to understand how to design well, how to communicate that, how to understand your user, no matter if it&#8217;s a brochure or you&#8217;re working on a product. It&#8217;s still the same. You still have a user that&#8217;s going to use it that you need to consider. So that&#8217;s how I formulate my team and really pushing them to learn, &#8220;Hey, you want to do motion? Okay, let&#8217;s do motion. Let&#8217;s grab you, and let&#8217;s have you work on this project.&#8221; It just really grows the team so quickly and allows us to have more people that can do a certain type of task.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So given that, how do you approach a new project if seems like designers can be that flexible to bounce between disciplines like that?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
My production team have learned&#8230; Again, we still have kid designers that might be really good at motion, or really good at long-form reports or annual reports, et cetera. Then we also know what designers want. I might have a designer who have asked, &#8220;Hey, I really want to work on an infographic,&#8221; and so we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Great.&#8221; Depending on the project, depending on the level that&#8217;s needed for that project, sometimes I do need a senior designer to work on a project. Sometimes I need an art director to work on the project. Sometimes it&#8217;s a team. We gather together, we look at all the projects and we assign them based on who can best deliver that project. Then if we have somebody that wants to learn, then they are also put on the team as well. And then from there, we schedule out and have a meeting, a launch, and the work gets done, and it&#8217;s always at a high quality. That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been known for, for my students as well, as well as my staff, that quality is important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look at your work, what would you say is the hardest part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I love design so much. It&#8217;s really a hobby as well when I&#8217;m in my off hours. So as I&#8217;m looking over what the hardest part is, is just making sure that&#8230; I think it&#8217;s more on the client side. So it&#8217;s just making sure that they understand our process and they understand the whys in the decision making that we have. The world is so much more design savvy because of media, because of video, social media. They&#8217;re seeing good design on an every basis. Several times a day, they&#8217;re just seeing good design come to them.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So a lot of clients will come with preconceived notions on what they think will be appropriate for their project, and sometimes it&#8217;s not. Understanding the user, understanding the metrics, understanding the goals and the KPIs they have on the project. So sometimes I have to sit and kind of explain why we came up with a certain direction for them to understand why it works. I will say, even though that is the difficult part, it 99.999% of the time works because when you use design, when you use the foundations of design, the theories of design, and you explain it back to the client, then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I get it. Great.&#8221; Because that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re hiring a firm for. So I think it&#8217;s the hardest part, but it&#8217;s also really rewarding as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s so interesting now, because clients, like you said, they&#8217;re exposed to more or we&#8217;re just all exposed to more through television or streaming or whatever. They&#8217;ll come with these very elaborate ideas and oftentimes it&#8217;s like a therapy session in a way where you&#8217;re trying to get to what the actual thing is that they&#8217;re trying to do so they don&#8217;t get so caught up in the visuals or the presentation. Or just letting them know that maybe the visuals and the presentation you&#8217;re looking for, maybe you can&#8217;t get that on your budget, but if there&#8217;s a certain feeling you&#8217;re trying to evoke, then maybe we can get there by doing these other things. And so it is very much this kind of push-pull process with clients sometimes.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Yeah. Always. Always. But you know what? It&#8217;s a rewarding thing. Our firm really is mission forward. We focus on education and opportunity and environment. So for us and just so much more, education is one of our large areas as well. With every single client, even though there&#8217;s that push-pull, there&#8217;s always this satisfaction because everything we&#8217;re doing is really to help them with their mission. At the end of the day, no matter how hard it is, you go home happy or rather you shut off your computer happy since we&#8217;re at home now. But yeah, it&#8217;s just a wonderful place to work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit. I know you&#8217;re a native of the DC metro area. I&#8217;d love to kind of learn more about what it was like growing up there for you.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. Actually I was born in Puerto Rico. My family&#8217;s from there. Have no accent because we came when I was two, and we moved to Silver Spring and throughout the years I&#8217;ve moved to several areas in Silver Spring. But I&#8217;m still here, and I love it.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
The DC area is really a melting pot. I think out of the top 10, there are two cities, maybe three cities that are the most diverse in the country within the DC area. So it was really different. When you grow up in the &#8217;70s, you&#8217;re in school and you have 63 countries represented in your school. That was the school I went to. 63 countries. We had 63 flags in our school. Yes, it was very different. It was very different. The older I got and the more I traveled, the more I realized that the DC area is so special. It is so special. I haven&#8217;t found a place that feels like it where you can have friends that look completely different from you, speak a different language, and nobody looks at you twice. No one. Like no one. They just don&#8217;t look at you twice, because that&#8217;s normal.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Of course being in the DC area, there&#8217;s also almost like a different economy as well too, because you have the government here. And this is one thing that I think people who grow up in the DC area need to realize as designers and just people, that when hardships happen around the country, they&#8217;re not quite as hard here because you have the government here and the government can&#8217;t shut down. So when 2008 happened, just traveling around the country, you could see so many areas with malls closed and strip malls closed and in the DC area, there were still open. The malls aren&#8217;t doing it quite as well now, but&#8230; So it&#8217;s always important for designers and creatives to just always learn and always see outside themselves. Just don&#8217;t live in a bubble, but always look outside of your area. See how other people are living and experiencing the same things you are because it&#8217;ll just make you a better strategic designer in terms of how you can deliver to the audiences you need to reach.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So growing up around all this diversity and this extremely multicultural school. I mean, 63 countries in one school, growing up is a lot. Were the arts and design kind of a big part of your childhood? Were you exposed to that a lot?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I was exposed to art in terms of drawing, and that was really nice. Our school had a really wonderful art program as well as high school. I was introduced to photography. I would make posters and I would draw, but I actually never heard the term graphic designer at all. I went to college first for architecture, and I got into one school, but decided that architecture wasn&#8217;t quite for me. So I graduated Maryland with an art degree because at that time, I found out later their design program was closed. But I had an art degree out of Maryland, and I still didn&#8217;t know the term graphic designer. So I decided to go back to school. I went to Montgomery College just to get a two-year degree in multimedia and design. So that&#8217;s the first time I heard design with multimedia and I was like, &#8220;Okay, this is cool. Let me take it.&#8221; And I just happened to take an elective called Quark.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Yeah. I just happened to take it because I had electives to take and I was like, &#8220;Quark. Hmm. I wonder what this Quark is.&#8221; And that&#8217;s the first time I saw graphic design because it was graphic design, I think like 120, and it was like Quark 101.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I took Quark and I was in the class and I remember just having such a good time. I mean, I was going for it. I was making newsletters. I mean, it was fun. Our screens were only like 15 inches and that was like state-of-the-art back then, because computers had just come in the scene just about three or four years earlier. They kind of became mainstream. And so I was in class and the professor, I will never forget him. Professor [inaudible 00:20:48], he looked at my work one day and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;You&#8217;re really good at this.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Good at what?&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Ah, good at this.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;What is this? I&#8217;m just making a newsletter.&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh dear God.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Can somebody tell this child what class she&#8217;s in?&#8221; And somebody&#8217;s like, &#8220;Graphic design.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Graphic design?&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yes, you can do this for a living.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Wait, what?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And at that moment I knew everything was going to be okay. I had found my passion. I really knew that it was going to be okay. I took every single graphic design class I could from him especially, and I graduated and I got my first job as a graphic designer with the Gazette newspapers, which was owned by The Washington Post at that time. And that&#8217;s how I got my start.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious about Quark. I want to go back to that because that&#8217;s a very&#8230; You said that and my mind immediately went to like&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if this is probably the right timeframe. I&#8217;m guessing this is like mid &#8217;90s probably?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
You are exactly right. You&#8217;re exactly right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
It was &#8217;94.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d have to research. I don&#8217;t even know if Quark is still like a thing now, but I remember first getting into Quark. I was in&#8230; Let&#8217;s see, &#8217;94 I&#8217;d probably just got into high school. So yeah. I remember using Quark and Adobe PageMaker because I designed my high school&#8217;s newspaper or redesign my high school&#8217;s newspaper. Because before that we were using or they were using&#8230; And this is because I grew up in the sticks, but also I think just because publishing hadn&#8217;t reached digital fully yet everywhere, but we were still doing mimeographs.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh wow, yeah. Yep. No, no. You laugh, but my first job, we were waxing down the pages of the newspaper on flats. So it really was the turn of graphic design becoming more digital to it being more mechanical. So using Exacto knives when we needed to change a word.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
But it was such good experience. So I love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s so interesting because you&#8217;re&#8230; I mean, you&#8217;re learning the tool and you&#8217;re learning how to do this. There&#8217;s no real examples that you can look at. When I think about what designers can do now and how much is out there in terms of education, they can go on YouTube. They could do LinkedIn Learning or they could do Skillshare or whatever. Like there&#8217;s so much out there. We were really winging it back then like just-</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh my God.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; trying to figure it out.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
We were. We were winging it and that&#8217;s why I love that class Quark, because the professor had a saying, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Welcome to my class. Number one, do you know the Mac, or have you ever used a Mac?&#8221; And I wasn&#8217;t sure how to answer that question. Some people raised their hand and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, more importantly, have you never used the Mac?&#8221; And I was about to raise my hand and the person next to me took my hand and said, &#8220;Do not raise your hand or he will kick you up.&#8221; And he kicked out two people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Ooh. Wow.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So I would&#8217;ve never known, I should have been a graphic designer. But the one thing he said is, I&#8217;m going to teach you everything about this application, every dropdown, popup menu. And it&#8217;s up to you to create something that visually communicates an idea.&#8221; And he did. He taught us every single part of that. It was almost like a YouTube in the class. I think the way he taught really did inspire me to teach as well, but you&#8217;re right, we had nothing. We had absolutely zero. We were just going into it like, &#8220;Okay, here&#8217;s a blank page. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). And really trying to figure it out and just see how these tools work. You could read the instruction manual, but the instruction manuals were like these big thick Bibles. It was hard to get your creativity around it when the instruction manuals were just&#8230; Well, I guess that&#8217;s the other thing. There were instruction manuals. There were like printed books that you had to go through and try to figure this stuff out. So it was&#8230; Wow, what a time.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
They were called Bibles.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What a time.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Like what Bible?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Uh-huh (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
The illustrator Bible, I remember, I remember. I know back in the day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about your early career after you graduated. Did you stay around in the DC metro area?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I did. I stayed around in the DC metro area and I worked for the Gazette newspapers. And I just remember just saying, &#8220;Hey, oh, I wish I could do more in design.&#8221; I just think that people are just put around you and you need to listen to their advice. And there was a coworker named Marie. She was awesome. And she was like, &#8220;Reece, you&#8217;re really talented. I don&#8217;t think you should be stuck here.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; this and the other. And she&#8217;s like, &#8220;You know what, I don&#8217;t want to hear you complaining unless you&#8217;re applying.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;What?&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, don&#8217;t complain to me about that you want more, unless you&#8217;re applying for another job.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;There&#8217;s no way I can get a job. I&#8217;m just one year out of school.&#8221; And she&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want to hear it.&#8221; And she was serious. She wouldn&#8217;t let me here until I started applying. I applied and I got my first firm job at HR communications in the DC area. And when I told her, she&#8217;s like, &#8220;There you go.&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad it worked.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;What?&#8221; And that&#8217;s just how she was.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And so I never complained about a job ever again, unless I was doing something about right. That was really good advice. And from HR communications, I went to an in-house marketing firm, which was great, because it was marketing communications and I really learned a lot about marketing. Went to focus groups, helped conduct them. And that was just wonderful experience to learn how your work is really resonating with your audiences. And I think for first time, and this was still the &#8217;90s, I realized that it&#8217;s not what I wanted. It&#8217;s what the customer needed that I needed to deliver. Design early on, was about your skill and how you could deliver it. But when I worked in that marketing group, I really learned that I need to listen to that audience and that was really eyeopening for me and just a wonderful experience there.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And then from there I went to another firm, and that firm was, I think the change in the quality of my work. This firm was called [inaudible 00:27:03]. And again, they were another marketing communications firm, but their designers hailed from around the world. They had a designer from Spain, a designer from Korea, and one from the Philippines and all over. And what was amazing was this being the &#8217;90s, I thought I knew all the programs. They&#8217;re the ones that taught me that, &#8220;Hey, oh my goodness, your program can actually merge with other programs.&#8221; And that&#8217;s when I learned that you could actually merge your files, and get this, from Illustrator into Photoshop. You could merge your layer files into&#8230; And that was way back in the day. It just changed the way I could design because now I could make montages that you could only see in magazines where you&#8217;re just like, &#8220;How&#8217;d they do that.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how they do that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And so they taught me all these really deep tricks and tips about the actual programs that I think really changed the quality of my design. And again, just really an amazing group of very talented designers. I remember when I got that job, I interviewed for it three times. And the first time I went, the owner was like, &#8220;You&#8217;re good, but you&#8217;re just not what we need. It&#8217;s not quite what we need.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Can you tell me about my work? What is it that you like, what is it that you don&#8217;t like? I don&#8217;t have an ego. Let me know how I can improve.&#8221; He told me, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;I like this, but our quality has more depth. It has more layering.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Okay, that sounds great.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So I went back and I kept designing, adding more things into my portfolio. About three months later they called me in. And at that time I told them, &#8220;Well, I have a new job. I&#8217;m not going to come in.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Just come in. Let&#8217;s just have a chat.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll just have a chat.&#8221; So I went and showed them a couple more pieces and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh wow, you listened.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Well, of course.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I love your work.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Of course I listened.&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hmm. All right. Hmm.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So he had me come back to talk to the art director and I realized at that time they were trying to have me leave the job that I had just started. And I wrote a list why I should stay at the job where I was or why I should go. And I realized that even if I stayed in this new firm for six months, the level of work that would come out of it would be so much more than I could ever get at the firm that I had gone to. So I decided to go. The only job that I have ever been in less than a year, but it was life changing. It was honestly life changing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now after that, is that when you ended up joining ASCD?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
That is correct. That is correct. That firm hit the dotcom era. The early 2000s where all the dotcoms kind of lost their funding. And that was 90% of our work. So the firm shut its doors and I was left without a job. And I was like, &#8220;All right.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Okay, what are we going to do here?&#8221; And I told myself, &#8220;Because now you have eight designers looking for work that each have the level of quality you have&#8230;&#8221; So I started looking for work and there were jobs that had a little bit more technical motion, people were getting into flashback then. And so I would just refer other designers and they would be like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, thank you so much,&#8221; because the job wasn&#8217;t right for me.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
But I also told myself, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to look for any job. It doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221; And I applied to a role for an in-house designer with an in-house agency. They called themselves an in-house agency. And that was kind of in the early 2000s. And that was rare to have a team of designers that would call themselves an in-house agency. So I went, I tried and I looked.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And the work, I was like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, what are you guys doing here?&#8221; I realized that they were a midsize publisher for educational book and products. And I was like, &#8220;This is amazing work. I&#8217;ve never done a book before.&#8221; So I showed my portfolio and I got the job. It was such an incredible experience, designing books and just growing within that environment, that I stayed. I also had a wonderful manager. And it&#8217;s true, you stay at a job where you have a great leader. And so he saw leadership potential within myself and would give me opportunities to lead projects. And then I started leading web projects, and then I started to lead applications. So product manage. It&#8217;s a wonderful experience where I was able to do everything from&#8230; Could design applications, as well as apps towards the end of the 15 years. Could design websites, online store, hundreds of books, just everything, run the gamut, including their large annual conference. So I would do the branding around the entire annual conference. And then through the years, I got promoted four times.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So it was just a wonderful opportunity to grow. And I was on vacation when that was a thing, when you left the&#8230; I got a call from a recruiter at LinkedIn for a position and I remember it just wasn&#8217;t right. I was happy where I was. And I said thank you and the recruiter said, &#8220;Well, just take a look at our job description online.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Sure, sure. I&#8217;ll go ahead and do that.&#8221; And so I clicked the link and here I am in France and I&#8217;m scrolling down, I&#8217;m scrolling down. I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I don&#8217;t think this is right.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And then there was in LinkedIn, at least back then, there was a title: Other jobs like these. And I was like, &#8220;Okay, so another job like this.&#8221; So I started looking at those jobs and there was one job there and it was The Hatcher Group. And I was like, &#8220;Huh, let me just read it.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re looking for a senior VP of design. Hmm. All right. Let&#8217;s take a look at what this looks like.&#8221; And it looked good. It was everything I was doing now. And I was like, &#8220;This is good,&#8221; but they really wanted to grow what they had as a design team. So they only had one designer and an intern and they were mostly a communications firm, QPR firm at that time, and they really wanted to grow it into more.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And so I&#8217;m reading the description and there&#8217;s one line and that line stuck out to me. And that line was, &#8220;Above all, we&#8217;re looking for someone who is kind.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Whoa.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I was like, &#8220;Whoa.&#8221; Yes, &#8220;Wow. Who looks for somebody who is kind? This is awesome.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Especially at an agency.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Especially at an agency. I was like, &#8220;Well, if I&#8217;m going to go somewhere, let me go to a place where they want somebody who&#8217;s kind. I think I&#8217;m kind, but I know they&#8217;re kind because they&#8217;re looking for someone who is like them.&#8221; So I knew that just from the job description. And so I applied and I got the job. And so that was four years ago and we&#8217;ve grown from one designer and one intern to a team of 16. So we&#8217;re doing some great things and I have an amazing team.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I focus on hiring diverse designers. I think it&#8217;s important. I think a lot of firms run into trouble when they don&#8217;t hire diverse designers because we can check with each other and say, &#8220;Hey, does this work for this audience?&#8221; Because you don&#8217;t have that lived experience. And that is very critical for me, but what it does too, is it teaches the other designers how to have a critical, but worldwide view of work that we&#8217;re doing, especially because we&#8217;re working with very sensitive topics as well in terms of education and the environment and equity within those spaces. It&#8217;s just really important to understand how the images that you use, the icons that you use, even the way it&#8217;s placed, how that reads to your intended audience and if it portrays them fairly. That&#8217;s actually something that we focus on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to go back briefly to ASCD. I mean, that was such a large part of your career. You were there for 15 years.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at that time, is there anything that really stands out to you that you remember the most?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely. We had a wonderful team. It&#8217;s where I learned how to manage. It&#8217;s where my boss gave me the opportunity to take his job as he was promoted into a larger role. And it&#8217;s also where I learned to ensure that your designers can grow in the way that they want to grow. Instead of keeping people siloed into one area, I learned that it works well. It works so well for that team. We were so productive and people grew exactly where they wanted to and they became designers first, and then they learned the mediums second. So that&#8217;s where I learned that.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Quality was actually something that was so key to that team and to my boss. And I learned that quality is actually something that happens when the whole team works together as a unit, when everybody helps each other. And so I also hire people that don&#8217;t have egos, because we really do critique each other and help each other grow and ensure that everything that comes out of our shop has the quality that the customer expects, the client expects. But most important, I learned how to manage. I learned that if you treat your people like you&#8217;re equal, like people, you&#8217;re not their parent and you shouldn&#8217;t be, but you treat them like you&#8217;re equal. And if you&#8217;re having a problem with someone, just have a conversation and say, &#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s going on? Is everything okay? How can I help you? You tell me how I can help you.&#8221; Then you have a team that will come to you first. If anything goes wrong, my team just comes to me and say, &#8220;Hey, here&#8217;s what went down.&#8221; And then I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay. So how did you fix it?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So we work through the solutions and we grow people. And I think that that is such a wonderful quality that I loved during the 15 years. I loved being able to go to my boss and say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s how I screwed up. Here&#8217;s how I think we should fix it. Do you agree?&#8221; And nine times out of 10 he did, &#8220;Oh yeah, that&#8217;s a great call. And you know what? It&#8217;s okay. We all screwed up sometimes.&#8221; And so I managed the same way and I think it&#8217;s really important that folks feel free to grow and to make those mistakes because that&#8217;s how you get exceptional designers. And I have exceptional designers. So I&#8217;m a very lucky person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, definitely sounds like to be able to have that level of openness among the team like that, that really takes really, I think depthful but also very skillful kind of just management. And with being at ASCD as long as you have, being able to really learn that in that environment has definitely helped out with what you&#8217;re doing at Hatcher.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Absolutely. Absolutely. 100%.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you also are a design educator. We&#8217;ve had several design educators here on Revision Path. You&#8217;re an adjunct professor at George Mason University where you&#8217;ve been since 2008. Tell me about your time teaching there. I&#8217;m curious, what are you teaching now?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Actually now, I start next week. I am teaching UX design as well as design principles and theory. So methods and principles, which is really the theory of design. It&#8217;s their first studio class where they learn how to design. And it&#8217;s one of my favorite classes. I&#8217;ve taught it since 2008 and I love it. I love it. I love it so much. And I love the outcome of not only the program and the students. About a fourth of my staff are my former students.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh really?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh absolutely. Oh absolutely. I snag them when I can. Absolutely. I kind of fell into teaching&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
One of the wonderful parts of working with the in-house firms is that they have lots of benefits. ASCD had tuition reimbursement, so I was like, &#8220;Hey, why don&#8217;t I get my M.F.A. in design?&#8221; And I found a program that had most of their classes at night in the University of Baltimore. I applied and got in, and I went through that there. I learned and worked with the head of the design program at George Mason, and one day I was just sitting around and he said, &#8220;You know, I think you would be a really good professor.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Oh no, not me. There&#8217;s no way,&#8221; because I grew up with a stutter. Just learning how to speak fluently was just really hard for me. And even now, even though I now have lived a little bit more than half my life without the stutter, I still can hear the struggle. So I just doubted myself so much and he just left it alone.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Years later, he called me and he said, &#8220;Hey, how about that teaching gig that I talked to you about?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Oh, it would be wonderful, but&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;I really need you.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you call me tomorrow? Think about it.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
The next day, I called him. I couldn&#8217;t sleep that night. I was so nervous about teaching. I just couldn&#8217;t sleep. And so I said, &#8220;You know what, I know it&#8217;s a good opportunity. It&#8217;s hard to get in, but I just don&#8217;t think I can do it.&#8221; And I left him a message and he didn&#8217;t answer me back. So I kept texting. The day after, he called me and said, &#8220;Hey, I got your message. I&#8217;m sorry I got it late. I already put your name in and I can&#8217;t change it.&#8221; And come to find out, he could have changed it. But I thank him every day. His name is Don Star. I thank him every single day for tricking me into a teaching job because the first night I taught, I realized, &#8220;I love this. This is so amazing.&#8221; And you just get this vibe when you teach.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
My mom was a teacher and she told me, she&#8217;s like, &#8220;When one of your students learns how to read, your whole body gets this shiver. You just get this vibe that, &#8216;Wow. What I&#8217;m doing is making a difference.'&#8221; And she&#8217;s right. I got that same vibe when I had a student who really understood a concept, understood a theory and was able to apply it and created something that looked so beautiful. And I was like, yes. And I got hooked. I got to teaching.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So I just got hooked to teaching. And with that first class, which was the design methods and theories class, I just had a great time. I kept teaching. There&#8217;s other classes I teach as well. I&#8217;ve taught typography, infographic design, motion graphics, and I just have a blast with it all. Like I said, I think that teaching is so important and learning how to teach those foundational skills are the critical part that I think is missing in some programs as well. Because I also interview and hire and look at hundreds of portfolios all the time, and just those little things that you can see throughout is what I teach. The things that people don&#8217;t get, or they don&#8217;t understand how to really put their work together or how to continually improve their work. So I just have a great time with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How would you say things have changed since you started teaching there? Have you grown as an educator?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I have. I don&#8217;t like grades, though I have to grade folks, but I love projects. And so my projects have gotten more complex. They also have introduced a digital aspect to them because everything now has a digital aspect. Even if you do a report, we&#8217;re asked to do social media or a little motion graphic video that will help to launch that report. So I think I use what I see at work as a part of how to improve the way I teach. So when I see shifts in the industry or in the way clients are asking for work, I also change how I teach to mirror that, to ensure where that my students are ready for hire as soon as they graduate</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
From your perspective, and again, you&#8217;ve been teaching since 2008 and you&#8217;ve mentioned these changes, what do design students, and I guess design graduates also, what do they want from the design industry?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
That&#8217;s actually a good question. I&#8217;ve had a couple students, especially during the pandemic really kind of reached out for co-mentoring because we haven&#8217;t been in person for two years. So they want to be ready. They want to be ready to get a job. They want to ensure that they&#8217;re not looked over. They really want to understand how their work applies in the real world. And that&#8217;s actually something that I do. As a part of every single class, I also take one class period to teach them salaries. What are you worth? What are you worth when you go out? Here&#8217;s the salary range. Here&#8217;s how you can adapt it for the DC area. Or let&#8217;s say you were going to New York, here&#8217;s how you adapt it. Let&#8217;s say you were going to Chicago, or let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re going to Alabama or to Mississippi. Here&#8217;s how you can change and see what you&#8217;re worth and how much you can ask for.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I also go over portfolios. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;These portfolios work and here&#8217;s why.&#8221; I go over resumes. &#8220;These resumes work and here&#8217;s why.&#8221; And I explain to them how to get ready for the real world. Why it&#8217;s important that their work is good. How they can self-edit to ensure that you don&#8217;t have one piece that looks really bad with work that looks really good, because I see that all the time. When I&#8217;m looking at the students&#8217; portfolios, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why did you add that invitation?&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, because I don&#8217;t have an invitation.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;But do you think it looks good?&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;No, it&#8217;s not my best work.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to judge you on that.&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, as a creative director, if I look at this, I&#8217;m going to say somebody helped you with everything else. And the one that looks bad is the one you did on your own.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Mm-hmm (affirmative).&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Take that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So I help them learn how to edit their work because as you&#8217;re coming up, you always have a couple of duds in there where you&#8217;re&#8230; They&#8217;re not horrible, but they&#8217;re just not the level of quality as some of your other work. So learn how to edit because your portfolio is the way that someone&#8217;s going to hire you. I really help them with that. And I think that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re really looking for. They&#8217;re looking for help to ensure that they can get a job, because we all know how it feels when you graduate and then you have to like make it on your own.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
That intense feeling of fear like, &#8220;Oh dear God, I&#8217;ve got to pay for everything myself.&#8221; And back then it was harder because you literally left home. Nowadays you can come back, things are changing a little bit. But back then, they were just like, &#8220;Okay, you&#8217;re gone. Bye college. You&#8217;re gone.&#8221; But kids still feel that. They still feel that fear. So just helping them know that these things can help them. And then I also do mock interviews and I do them in class so that people can see how I answer questions. I tell them, &#8220;Just ask me anything.&#8221; And I&#8217;ve gotten some really tough questions for them to see how I answer that so that they can really have a leg up when they go to their first interview.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
And even afterwards I will help students. I give them my email address. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hey, you want a mock interview? Let&#8217;s do it. You want me to look at your portfolio? Let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; Just the other day, I had a student who was so nervous about an interview that they had, catchy with Deloitte, and they were just so nervous. And so they just wanted me to go over again&#8230; They just wanted to practice and they wanted to go over it one on one. So I took some time to help that student and they reached out and said that they got the job and I was so excited because there&#8217;s another level that&#8217;s hard here to the pandemic. Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
So they just have that nervousness going out. I take the time for that too, because I think it&#8217;s important and I wish I had that when I was first coming out. And so I make sure that I&#8217;m there for them so that they don&#8217;t have to feel like they&#8217;re going out alone.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I think what you&#8217;re doing with reviewing their portfolio and resumes and talking about salaries and doing mock interviews, that stuff is so, so, so important for designers just to get out there and know what it is that they have to do to try to compete in the marketplace, but also to position themselves in the best possible light.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve done some work in the past with the art institutes, particularly the Art Institute of Atlanta here in Atlanta. They sort of do this thing every year where they bring in people from the local design community and they have a dinner at the school. And what they&#8217;re doing with that is one, just trying to meet practitioners out in the city, but also to get a sense of like, &#8220;What do we need to be teaching students? What out there are you seeing in the market that we need to inform them of?&#8221; Whether that&#8217;s about upcoming technologies or certain-</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; design trends or things like that, to try to stay current and keep up on top of things. It&#8217;s funny, you&#8217;re talking about your adjunct experience and I&#8217;m thinking about, I taught adjunct&#8230; Oh, this was 2012 I think. Like 2011, 2012, I was teaching like a principles of web design course-</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh, love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; as an adjunct. And what I tell you, it was so dated&#8230; Well, first of all, it was a BIS course. It was a business information systems kind of major. So it already wasn&#8217;t like technically really designed. You were just teaching business students enough design to sort of get by, I guess. But the curriculum was so old.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like when I started, they had students learning how to design web pages using tables. And I&#8217;m like, this is 2011, 2012, sometime around that.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I learned tables in the &#8217;90s.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Me too. I learned tables in the &#8217;90s too. And I&#8217;m like you have to teach because this was in that period where CSS layout design of course was the norm at that point. I remember working at AT&#038;T in 2007-ish and we made the switch from tables to CSS. I mean, you want to talk about seeing grown people cry at work?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I know. I remember that switch. It was emotional for many.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In this teaching thing, I remember going to the Dean and like petitioning to rewrite the curriculum because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You&#8217;re setting these students up to fail-&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8220;&#8230; if you&#8217;re teaching them how to design in tables and then they go out there in the world trying to get some design jobs to say they have some HTML experience and it&#8217;s this dated. We&#8217;re not setting them up in the best light.&#8221; Eventually they did let me rewrite the curriculum. So I did teach them basic CSS and stuff, but I&#8217;m thinking like, &#8220;What if I didn&#8217;t?&#8221; Or what if another educator was just like, &#8220;Oh, this is what I&#8217;m teaching? Okay.&#8221; And just went with it. So the fact that you&#8217;re extending that out, you&#8217;re doing way more than usual. I mean, I certainly commend you for that.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh thank you. But now, what I was going to say is that that&#8217;s really important and that&#8217;s one of the things that I love about George Mason. Is that with the curriculum that I&#8217;m able to continually update it. So every single semester I update everything to ensure&#8230; Including my samples, because I want to make sure that the students have the latest and the greatest of how you can incorporate design into all this new technology. And it&#8217;s just really important to be able to do that because it&#8217;s true. Just like you said, if you don&#8217;t do that, you are setting them up to fail from the beginning and school&#8217;s not cheap, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s make sure they have all the right tools so that they can go out and live their best life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is the design community like for you at this stage in your career?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh, it&#8217;s awesome. The DC area, as well as the Baltimore area, because I&#8217;m still connected through school, they have such a strong design community that they overlap as well at times, but it&#8217;s really strong. I&#8217;m a part of AIGA, I volunteer. I am on The Continuum Fund, which is a scholarship fund for underserved designers, and it&#8217;s just wonderful. It&#8217;s great to grow with designers and also bring up new designers and seeing them grow in leadership roles as well. It&#8217;s actually something that&#8217;s important because no matter how large your city is, the design community is actually small. And that&#8217;s the thing that I think that people need to understand. Like I&#8217;m connected with so many people around the city and know when they&#8217;re looking for someone, I can refer other people. And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to always get connected to the community where you are, because it&#8217;s a great way to help you find jobs or just to grow and design or just to give back, to mentor or to help an upcoming student or designer that joins a group. So I encourage everybody to do that if they can.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you&#8217;re a recent DC design fellow. Congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Thank you so much. I was shocked and honored to be named an AIGA Fellow. It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s given to just a few people and not every year. And for me to be chosen, I was very humbled and just very gracious. It just makes me want to triple my efforts in terms of what I&#8217;m doing and teaching and mentoring, because I realize now that it&#8217;s made a difference. The power of just winning that award is just realizing that you can make a difference. You can help your community just by giving back. It was a really fun experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of your influencers? Who inspires you?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
It&#8217;s actually everyone around me, but including, and I think the most important are my students. I am the creative director I am today, I am the leader I am today because of them. They inspire me to push further. They inspire me and grow&#8230; They just have just great ideas that they use on their projects, that they come forward, that they ask, &#8220;Hey, can I do this?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hmm, I don&#8217;t see why not. Let&#8217;s have a go.&#8221; And so they keep me always growing, learning and searching for new ways to apply design. And they inspire me every day. I think that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m hooked to learning and I&#8217;m hooked to teaching because basically I learn from them. As much as they learn from me, I learn from them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are you the most excited about at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I think I am the most excited about how technology is informing design, how we can apply design to new things. For example, augmented reality. So AR, VR and how I can apply that within my teaching, as well as within my own firm. I love how the industry and how design has to continually change. I think that that keeps us fresh. It keeps us learning. It keeps us growing. And that&#8217;s important. I mean, I think creativity really requires the pursuit of experiencing learning and observing as much as you can. One of the things I always say is you cannot design what you don&#8217;t know. So you have to continually be curious and open-minded and just always be a student. And just continuing to learn, not only in your field, but what&#8217;s around it, and be ready for it so that you can continue to visually communicate ideas to your clients.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? I mean, with what you&#8217;ve got going on with teaching, as well as your work at The Hatcher Group, it sounds like you&#8217;ve got a very, very bright future in terms of what you want to.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
I&#8217;m always living in the present. Right now, I am so excited with the work I&#8217;m doing at The Hatcher Group. I recently got promoted to executive vice president, which actually allows me to do a lot more business development, not only with the firm, but with our clients. So it&#8217;s a wonderful place for me to be. In five years, I can tell you, as long as they&#8217;ll have me, I will still be teaching. That I do know. I love it. It&#8217;s how I actually relax after a long day, is I teach. And the moment I go in and I say, &#8220;Hi class, how are you doing?&#8221; Like all the stress leaves. And we just have a great time and we laugh and just learn together.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
In terms of what I do, I hope that I&#8217;m always going to be tied to design in some way, the next five years for me, just really&#8230; It incorporates me continuing to learn. I&#8217;m always looking at the next program. I know it&#8217;s weird, but I am looking at a doctor&#8217;s program. So I think it&#8217;s important for me to continue just growing and learning within my own field, and right now just doing what I do at Hatcher.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Well, they can go to thehatchergroup.com as well as my own personal website, 09creative.com. And I am also on LinkedIn at linkedin.com/reecequinones</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Reece Qui√±ones, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. I mean, just going through everything that you are doing with The Hatcher Group and with education and your background and everything. I mean, you&#8217;re someone that I think a lot of people in design industry can look up to. It&#8217;s so interesting before we recorded, you were talking about how you don&#8217;t know, or you didn&#8217;t know why you received the DC fellow award. And I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t see how you didn&#8217;t know considering how much you&#8217;ve been, not just a practitioner in design for a very long time, but also how much you&#8217;re giving back to the next generation of design through teaching-</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Oh, thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; and everything. So I am so glad to have had you on the show and to share your story and I look forward to seeing what comes next. Thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Reece Qui√±ones:</b><br>
Thank you so much. I had an awesome time.</p>
