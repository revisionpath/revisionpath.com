Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>It takes a lot of hard work, dedication, and sacrifice to make it on your own as an artist, and Akeem Roberts knows this well. This illustrator and animator juggles being an associate director at Holler Studios with freelancing for <em>The New Yorker</em>. Even though Akeem&#8217;s been in the game for nearly a decade, I have a feeling that we&#8217;ll be seeing his work for many years to come.</p>
<p>We talked about Akeem&#8217;s new gig at Holler, and from there he went into sharing his unique approach to storytelling. Akeem also spoke about attending the University of South Carolina, went into some of his influences for his artistic style, and gave some great advice for handling operational tasks as a freelancer. Akeem knows that success doesn&#8217;t happen overnight, and he&#8217;s put in the time and effort to come out on top!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
My name is Akeem S. Roberts. I&#8217;m a cartoonist for The New Yorker. illustrator for J.D. the Kid Barber series, and a book designer by day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2023 been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
2023 has been pretty crazy so far. I started off the year unemployed, just doing freelance stuff, and as of like three weeks ago, I just got a brand new job and sort of getting the reins on that and everything&#8217;s been going pretty good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. Congratulations on the new job.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have any plans for the summer? Anything you want to do?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
For the summer, right now I don&#8217;t have anything planned. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll just try to go to a beach or a lake or something and just relax for a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious, from last year to this year, aside from the employment change that you mentioned about, have there been any other kind of changes for you? Anything else going on?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I&#8217;d say from last year to this year, I&#8217;ve more committed to being in publishing versus animation, which was kind of the main thing that I did at the start of my career was mostly animation. After I started doing stuff at The New Yorker and stuff with Kokila, I slowly started making the transition into publishing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What brought that transition on aside from just more work? Was it a feeling or anything?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I felt like for animation mostly it was things move a little bit slower and it feels like the artists&#8230; I guess I was a cog in the machine animation-wise, while publishing, even though I am still just in the machine, I have a little more of a voice and a little more of a say, and I guess it just feels more freeing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds like there&#8217;s just more, I guess, agency, I guess, in publishing.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yes, exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Let&#8217;s talk about some of your work that you&#8217;re doing as a freelance illustrator. I&#8217;m curious, what does a regular day look like for you these days?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
If I&#8217;m doing dailies for The New Yorker, I&#8217;ll try to get up around like 7:00 and then hit Twitter or some kind of news source and just go through trending and try to see what&#8217;s going on, what happened in the past 24 hours. Then, I&#8217;m seeing if I can find a joke and connect that into a bit for The New Yorker for their daily cartoons.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re creating new pieces every day, so you have to check the news, be like, &#8220;Oh, this is funny,&#8221; draw something, and-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; then it&#8217;s just done? That&#8217;s it?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
It depends on the process. Sometimes, for instance, I got one in for a daily after the trailer of the Barbie movie dropped. For that, I had an idea of doing something of scientists trying to get to the Barbie because there was all of those memes about people saying three, how many or whatever for Barbie movie tickets. I wanted to like have that idea of getting to the Barbie movie first and having it happen immediately, so I was first thinking like scientists creating a time machine to get there on the day that it&#8217;s released. Then, for The New Yorker, I thought of that idea, but I put a little bit of &#8217;80s nostalgia in it, so then I changed it to kind of like Back to the Future where they&#8217;re trying to go to the future to see the Barbie movie.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like Marty and Doc Brown and the DeLorean?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, so they&#8217;re all sitting in the JCPenney parking lot trying to get to the Barbie movie.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s funny. It&#8217;s interesting, though, that you have to, I guess, get them in by a certain time, but it&#8217;s every day, so that makes sense, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. For the dailies, it&#8217;s you have to get the sketches to them before 9:00, and then they&#8217;ll let you know if they like it or not by 10:00, and then you have that done by noon. The one that I did for the Barbie was like a bonus for the daily, so I didn&#8217;t have to get that done till 2:00.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. No, that&#8217;s just interesting that it&#8217;s so fast. I don&#8217;t know why I thought maybe you would have done it the day before or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I think some people do. I&#8217;m reckless.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I see you do a little bit of everything, book illustrations, you do comics, you do animation, you do editorial work. Is there a particular one of these that you prefer to do?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I think I prefer to do comics and publishing chapter book stuff. I feel like that gives me the most control, but also the most freedom. I feel like when you&#8217;re usually doing a comic book, you got to do like 30-something pages and the deadline&#8217;s pretty tight, but when it comes to chapter books or whatever, it&#8217;s a little bit&#8230; It&#8217;s still tight, but it&#8217;s not as, I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s not as hard just because you&#8217;re just doing one panel kind of basically, versus doing nine panels, trying to semi-tell a story, designing multiple backgrounds. It&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. I can see how doing it in that sort of controlled format also, it&#8217;s just easier on you probably just on your workload, you know?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me about how you approach a new project. What does your process look like?? Does it vary per type?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, it definitely varies per type, per project. For anything that&#8217;s like New Yorker, that&#8217;s just I&#8217;m just on the subway jotting down ideas. I send my notes app and I&#8217;ll just like think of jokes, try to connect them, and then from there I&#8217;ll draw a little small thumbnail and then sketch a bigger illustration for that and then send that to the New Yorker. Then, my process for when I&#8217;m doing my web comics also starts on my phone. I just write a joke, describe what&#8217;s happening in the panels. Then, from there I do a thumbnail and then I finalize it and then add all the texts and stuff.</p>
<p>Then, for animation, usually with this, there&#8217;s only a couple of those that I started from scratch where I had a original character and original plot. Those started off more&#8230; I was in Word and Google Docs instead because it was longer format and I had to share it with other people to read, look over, see if they had any notes on the script. For those, it&#8217;s like script first, and then you start the thumbnails and animating each thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What if you&#8217;re doing, say, editorial work or something for the book? Is that process kind of the same?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, editorial is like you&#8217;ll&#8230; Most of the stuff that I did editorial for was like for Men&#8217;s Health. They have this section called Cool Dads-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; so for that, I would like&#8230; They would give me the article that a celeb wrote, and then I would read it. Then, from there, I would like think about an illustration that kind of hit the vibe of what the celeb wrote. The latest one I did was for like LeVar Burton. His whole thing was talking about reading books to his daughter and giving her the freedom to read and how he wants to be there for her. Then, he also makes a reference basically to Harry Potter.</p>
<p>For that, I just drew him in like the garbs with a wand fighting off the Dementors because in the article he talks about how his daughter stopped reading because she didn&#8217;t like the Dementors. He was like, &#8220;Maybe I should have not introduced her to Harry Potter.&#8221; I just took that vibe and added it to the illustration. I would send like three sketches and then the art director over there would pick which one they think is the best. Then, from there I would finish and color it and everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You kin of have to read a little bit of what it is that you&#8217;re going, then, to make sure that the illustration kind of matches that in some way.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. With every editorial or even like the children&#8217;s book, you have to read the manuscript and everything first before you can fully get the gist of it to kind of sum it up in whatever illustration, whether it&#8217;s for a chapter or for an article.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Last year, I was Editor-in-Chief of a print magazine. This was part of the job that I was doing at the time, and our in-house creative director had decided for our first issue that he wanted to also do all the editorial illustrations. I was like, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; &#8220;a lot, but if you want to do it.&#8221; He also did the cover and everything. I was like, &#8220;Look, more power to you.&#8221; It was so funny because the way he approached it was like, &#8220;Well, I have an idea of a theme for the whole magazine,&#8221; and so he just did illustrations based on whatever, and none of them matched the article in any sort of real way. I&#8217;m telling him like, &#8220;You should probably try to make sure that the images match what the article is about. You drew a polar bear. This article has nothing to do with polar bears. What&#8217;s the connection for the reader to look at this?&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, well, the connection is winter because we&#8217;re publishing the magazine in the winter.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Huh. No, no.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t make any-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s sounds like a little bit of a stretch, but you know, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s one of us that feels it. I mean, eventually we ended up sort of just going with the concept because we didn&#8217;t have enough time, but for the second issue, the pieces fit the article more and I told him like, &#8220;Look, read the article and then get started with designing.&#8221; He would just start designing and be like, &#8220;Oh, I have to read the article?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yes, it would help. It would be helpful so at least what you&#8217;re designing matches that in some capacity.&#8221; So&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah yeah. You got to read the article.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
You got to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, how do you approach storytelling through your art? I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s more than just like in, say, the book illustration example, it&#8217;s more than just reading. How do you really approach telling a story through your art?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I would read it and then I would like try to imagine it in my head and say, for instance, for the J.D.the Kid Barber series that I did, for that it was reading it, and then the art director would kind of tell me what they imagined in it. They were like, &#8220;Oh, this character is in their room,&#8221; but it&#8217;s up to me to add anything else that I wanted to add into it, so I would just try and look up Google images basically to find what I imagined this school look like because references, it&#8217;s always great to have. I know sometimes it&#8217;s like, especially when you&#8217;re starting out, you want to not use any references. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;I can do this from my head.&#8221; You can&#8217;t. I mean, you can, but you&#8217;ll miss the small details that you want to have caught if you weren&#8217;t looking at a reference. I would look at reference, kind of imagine the area, and then just try to imagine the characters just living and breathing.</p>
<p>For some of them I would add even like small jokes. One of the illustrations, the art director was, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s losing this battle, but everyone has numbers up saying 10 for this guy who&#8217;s winning.&#8221; Then, for one of those, I drew his friend in there giving him a thumbs up with like a two, so everyone has a good rating except he has a bad rating for the guy, and he&#8217;s got a thumbs up giving it to the guy being like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I got your back.&#8221; I try to put in little jokes like that inside the book so kids will see it and notice it. I&#8217;m trying to always make an illustration for, I guess, like the younger me if I was reading it as a kid.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. Do you try to add a little something that&#8217;s just unique to you in each image that you do?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
If I do try to add anything, I try to add humor. I feel like that&#8217;s my go-to form of communicating is trying to add a joke if I can.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, we&#8217;ve had a few New Yorker illustrators on the show before, most recently, Liz Montague. I&#8217;m curious, how did you get started with doing illustrations for The New Yorker?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I feel like my story is very unique. I have yet to hear anyone else who&#8217;s had this experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Basically I was like tabling at this convention in New York called Mocha Fest, which is like an art festival, and I had a bunch of comics that I had done online and this little short story that I did that was in black and white. After that weekend, I got a message from Emma who&#8217;s like the Editor at New Yorker. She was, &#8220;Oh, do you want to do a daily shouts?&#8221; Basically like, &#8220;I like your work, and I was wondering if you want to try to submit some jokes or a daily shout or anything like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was like, &#8220;All right,&#8221; and then I sent my first batch, and then after that Friday after I sent it they were like, &#8220;Oh yeah, this one is in.&#8221; I sold one the very first time I tried, which was crazy good. I don&#8217;t know anyone else who&#8217;s done that. Maybe other people have, but I had sold it first immediately. Then, the next week, I also submitted some batches and I also sold another one, so I was feeling really good. I was like, &#8220;All right, I can do this,&#8221; and then after that, it was 40 weeks of like not selling anything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that usually like the&#8230; You said that was sort of unique to you. I&#8217;m just curious, what would a cartoonist normally do if they&#8217;re trying to get into like The New Yorker? Is there a more-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; typical process?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s like submissions that you can do on the website, and you can send them batches that way. Then, they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;You&#8217;ve made it,&#8221; and then you&#8217;ll get Emma&#8217;s email, so you can start sending batches to her directly. Sort of like a filtering process before you get her email, but I just got it immediately and then got one in immediately, which felt good. Then after that, it slowed down a bit, obviously.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, you&#8217;re still doing it now, so, I mean, it obviously worked out in your favor.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there a particular style that you think, I guess&#8230; I guess it probably varies per publication, but for The New Yorker, and not to harp on them specifically, but is there a particular style that you think they&#8217;re looking for?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
For The New Yorker, I think they&#8217;re looking kind of for something that is sketchy and has detail, but not too much. Nothing that will distract from the joke.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Basically just like if you had to jot down a joke with stick figures in five minutes, that&#8217;s kind of the ideal I think like they want in terms of detail is just not enough stuff that will distract from it. Then, they definitely don&#8217;t want it too cartoony, which is like I always put my stuff, and maybe sometimes it&#8217;s too cartoony, but there&#8217;s a line where you&#8217;re trying to hit where it&#8217;s not cartoony in the sense that it feels like on a Saturday morning cartoon, but also not cartoony in the way that it feels like it&#8217;s Family Guy. You got to hit a perfect, unique just like sketch style that takes a lot of work, but looks simple.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm. I get what you&#8217;re saying. I get what you&#8217;re saying. Certainly, nothing that&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know, Marvel style, like not a comic kind of thing, but you also-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; want it to have some level of expression and polish, as you would say, that doesn&#8217;t detract from the joke.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve worked with some other big clients as well, Boom! Studios. You mentioned Men&#8217;s Health earlier, Conde Nast, which is over a bunch of different magazines and such. Is it easier working with bigger clients like those than, say, smaller clients?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
For sure. I feel like bigger clients, they kind of have an idea and they kind of let you be free, especially if they know your work. They&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;All right, I saw your work. I kind of imagine what you can do. If you&#8217;ll do that, we&#8217;ll be great.&#8221; I feel like when it comes to mom and pop type of clients, it&#8217;s a little less freeing for the artists in a sense because I guess the dollar value that they&#8217;re spending is&#8230; it&#8217;s precious, their $500 or whatever.</p>
<p>This thing that you&#8217;re doing for them, especially if it&#8217;s like a logo or anything that they&#8217;re going to use over again for t-shirts, it&#8217;s very important. Because of that and because of how important it is to them, they&#8217;re sometimes a little overbearing. They&#8217;ll overwork in illustration because of having multiple revisions that kind of the artist loses&#8230; The more revisions that&#8217;s happening, the artist kind of loses the spirit sometimes. If it&#8217;s 20 revisions to get this logo done, the artist each time is less and less into it-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and that doesn&#8217;t mean that there will be a point where they don&#8217;t care. The artist is always going to care because it&#8217;s for their portfolio and their job. They want it to be good. It&#8217;s kind of like a way of the artist helping&#8230; not helping themselves, but guarding themselves from being like&#8230; If you&#8217;re too personally attached, you&#8217;ll get upset about the notes-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; so you have to be removed. The more and more you get notes, the more and more you&#8217;re like, &#8220;All right, this is getting away from my vision and I&#8217;m trying to see if I can get exactly what they&#8217;re seeing in their head,&#8221; which is not normally something an artist can reproduce is what another person is envisioning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like if I had to do 20 revisions on a design, I would want to fire the client. To me, that feels like the client really doesn&#8217;t know what they want, and they feel like you&#8217;re just going to keep iterating on it until it magically appears to them. I mean, I know that&#8217;s how we&#8217;re sort of just pulling that number out of anywhere, but I get what you&#8217;re saying about the dollar value, which I think is something that&#8217;s really important. A lot of these bigger companies just have the budget to be able to do bigger type projects, more audacious ideas, et cetera, but then smaller clients, that money has to really go far. That&#8217;s not to say that larger clients aren&#8217;t as invested in the end project, but it just takes on&#8230; There&#8217;s an added gravity to it when it&#8217;s from a smaller client or for a smaller client, I should say.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Can you discuss any upcoming projects or collabs that you&#8217;re excited about?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Right now, I don&#8217;t really have anything coming up. I guess the only thing I have is I&#8217;m working on a graphic novel and I&#8217;m trying to pitch to HarperCollins or Kokila to just get the story that I have in my head off the ground.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I&#8217;ve always wanted to do a graphic novel. I cannot draw, but I have had ideas for characters in my head since I was a teenager to put into a graphic novel. I&#8217;ve talked about it here on the show before. People probably already know this, but one day I&#8217;m going to have the time and the funds to make it happen, so I hope it works out for you.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m hoping it works out, too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I want to get more into your work and your career, but let&#8217;s learn more about Akeem. Let&#8217;s learn more about you. Are you originally from New York?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
No, I am kind of like from everywhere is what I tell everyone. I was born in North Dakota and my Mom was in the military, so I moved around a lot from North Dakota to Alabama, to Germany, to South Carolina, to Texas, to Maryland, to New York. A lot of places, but most of my time was in the South, so I guess I could just say I&#8217;m from the South.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Did you do a lot of drawing growing up?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yes. I would just say that I started drawing&#8230; There&#8217;s two big reasons I started drawing, so first I was just doodling, and then in third grade, I won an award for the state in South Carolina, third place for this painting I did-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and that was a good boost. I was like, &#8220;Oh, wow, this is cool. I can draw.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t really think of anything of it. I was just like, &#8220;All right, I can doodle.&#8221; Then, in fifth grade, there was this girl that could draw way better than me. I was crushing, so then I would try to get better to impress her, and I think that&#8217;s kind of my origin story is trying to get better to impress a girl. Then, I just kept drawing on my own.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did it work?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
It did not work, you know? So-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; ultimately it was for me, you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I had someone on the show a couple episodes ago, Kendell Burton, and he was telling me how he first&#8230; He&#8217;s an art director now, but he was like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I first got into design in the web because I was making a blog on Zynga to try to meet girls.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Does that work?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Never does.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You were doing a lot of drawing and stuff growing up, and I see you went to the University of South Carolina and majored in Media Arts. Tell me about that time. What was that like?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Media Arts, basically, I ended up there because I was very late at applying for colleges, and my family had just moved back to South Carolina, so then I just applied there. This guy that I met with was like, &#8220;Oh, tell me what you want to do.: I was telling him that I probably would want to do some animation, like comics and stuff, and so he was&#8230; The Media Arts Program, which is basically teaching you how to use the Adobe Suite while learning about film, photography, script writing, and so it was like mostly on the film and photography side. Then, I minored in Illustration, so I did like one figure drawing class on my senior year and one illustration class on my senior year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you feel like they really kind of prepared you as an artist?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I feel like not in a sense of what I ideally wanted to do, which was basically do animation and stuff like that. I didn&#8217;t have a student film. I didn&#8217;t even take the animation course because I never signed up in time, but I guess overall, it kind of helped me be a jack-of-all-trade because certain things with film and photography and script writing can transfer into illustration. Having that does help me visualize ideas, but not necessarily in the sense of, &#8220;Okay, you do this something. You&#8217;ll have a job immediately after.&#8221; You know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think school is interesting in that way. I mean, I majored in Math, so I didn&#8217;t think-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Oh no.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; when I was graduating I was going to have&#8230; Actually, no. I mean, I did major in Math, that&#8217;s true, but I had like a scholarship thing lined up with the program that I was in that I was going to work for the government after I graduated. Then, that fell through like junior year because of 9/11. It fell through. I was like, &#8220;Oh, I have no plans for what I&#8217;m going to do when I graduate.&#8221; I was working part time at the Symphony here in Atlanta selling tickets, and I did that, I think&#8230; I did that up till I graduated, and I remember when I graduated they took the calculator away from my kiosk because they were like, &#8220;Well, you have a math degree now. You don&#8217;t need this.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Is that supposed to be funny?&#8221;</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&#8217;t need it, but I didn&#8217;t have any sort of career plans lined up after graduation because I thought I was set. I really didn&#8217;t even pursue other companies. I snuck my resume into other departments&#8217; resume books so I could get interviews at places. I was wholly unprepared going into senior year for any kind of actual career goals. I was in college just because I was a nerd that liked math.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah. That actually sounds very familiar to my story. That&#8217;s basically kind of like how I ended up in New York was my friend got me an internship in New York, and then I did that internship for the summer, but it kind of fell through near the end. Then, I was working at Starbucks in South Carolina. I was making $9 an hour, but the rent was just so much. Most of my money was going towards the rent-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and then it was like&#8230; I think the rent was&#8230; I want to say almost like 600, almost 800, which is a lot. Then, they were like, &#8220;Oh, you could transfer to the Starbucks in New York,&#8221; which I transferred and I was making like 13. Then, the apartment I had up here was 584 with everything included, so I was way better off staying in New York, and that&#8217;s just like how I got here was not planning on staying. I came up for an internship and I was like, &#8220;All right, I&#8217;m just going to go back,&#8221; but then it just seemed to work out better for me to just live here than be in South Carolina barely making it-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; you know?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; that makes sense, and I would say also probably as an artist, I mean, you kind of want to be in the cultural capital of the country when it comes to experiences and stuff. I would imagine you probably wouldn&#8217;t have access to the same level of experiences in South Carolina that you would in New York City, you know?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I mean, I feel like&#8230; Okay, so when I was going to college, there was this rumor that actually a bunch of comic artists actually lives in South Carolina, which might be true, but I just never met anyone.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If I recall, and this was years ago when I interviewed him, Sanford Greene, who&#8217;s like, I know he&#8217;s done stuff for Marvel, for DC, pretty prolific visual artist, lives in South Carolina. He lives in South Carolina.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Oh really?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, he went to Benedict&#8217;s.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yep.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, so like yeah, I guess&#8230; Look, I guess South Carolina is the home for the comic artist, but I just could not find that community at all, but comic artists tend to be homebodies, so you would never really see them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I&#8217;d imagine, yeah, it&#8217;s probably not&#8230; There&#8217;s no collective or something like that. I would say it&#8217;s probably just easier in New York because of availability and just the cultural atmosphere of the city. I came from a small town in Alabama, and if I would&#8217;ve stayed there after I graduated high school, I&#8217;d know I wouldn&#8217;t be doing what I&#8217;m doing now because there was no kind of technology or design or anything. You either got married, got into the church, or maybe worked a factory job. Not a lot of options.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s not endemic of the South, but just in particular, like-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah [inaudible 00:30:14].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; your environment can help out, you know?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
No, no, I hear you. I have a bunch of family from Alabama.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. One of your early career gigs, you were at this place called ideaMACHINE Studio where you worked as an animator. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
All right, so crazy with that was one of my friends came up and he was doing photography. I was still working at Starbucks at this time, and he was like, &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s an animation studio just like here. Do you want to apply?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;All right, cool.&#8221; We possibly could work in the same building, whatever, so I applied. Then, I got the job, and then that same day my friend got fired from whatever company he was working at in the building, so it&#8217;s like we didn&#8217;t get to work together, but he did help me get this job by seeing it. Then, at that same time, I was still working at Starbucks, which I worked that job while also doing Starbucks for like a year and a half just doing both of them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, and at Starbucks, I had just became a shift manager. I would only work two or three days a week, but it was weird because I&#8217;d be in charge then, so it&#8217;s like&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You were able to kind of juggle it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I was able to juggle it, but it was surreal once I think about it, just like how many hours I was working. It was a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How was ideaMACHINE Studio? Was that kind of your first studio experience?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, that was my first studio experience. That one, it was a little more&#8230; I guess in a sense it kind of trained me, kind of gave me the animation class kind of a sense because I went in there knowing some stuff, but not really knowing the 12 principles of animation or anything like that, just what I saw online. Most of the stuff that I did for them was kind of like whiteboard explainer videos.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
It was like for pharmaceutical companies that had this idea, but wanted it to be explained in a simply way. That&#8217;s what we did for them. There was tiny stuff that you can animate, and then I would push it every once in a while to try and get better at my animation chops and my graphic design skills. I guess in a sense that job kind of trained me, but it was very reluctantly because the guy who runs the company was&#8230; I was trying to get better at art, and he was like, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to get better at drawing.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221; Then, I just kept pushing and doing my web comic on the side was also something I did. Just work on my skills and progress my abilities to draw and stuff like that. Was just doing that weekly in order to force myself to put something out consistently and have a foundation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, so you were doing this kind of freelance work or doing your own work at least as well as doing this nine-to-five. How did you balance that?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I did not sleep a lot is how I balanced that. Basically, I would work during the day. If I had a Starbucks shift, maybe it was two or three hours, so I&#8217;d work nine to five, and then I would walk over to the Starbucks. I just happened to be super close to this company and then work four hours there and then come back home, which the commute was good. It was like 30 minutes, not that bad, especially for New York, and then work on my freelance stuff. Then that started again in the morning. It was a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s amazing the stuff that we pull off when we&#8217;re younger just to try to get that&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, I guess you just have all that youthful energy. You can get it done. Nowadays, absolutely not. I&#8217;m in bed-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; at a certain hour. I not staying up pulling all-nighters anymore. No, I get what you&#8217;re saying. It takes a lot to try to make sure you&#8217;re doing all of these things because, of course, you&#8217;re doing what you have to do to pay your bills and whatever, but you&#8217;re also establishing yourself during this time doing your own thing, which I think is super important. It&#8217;s something I tell a lot of designers that come on the show, especially ones that just start off, like have something on the side that&#8217;s just your own thing, you know?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You can still do what you have to do to get involved with your career at your workplace, but have something that&#8217;s just yours.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, after you worked at ideaMACHINE, you ended up at another studio called Holler where you were their Associate Animation Director. Was that a big shift from your work at ideaMACHINE?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, that was a big shift. One of the main things that like&#8230; The reason I left ideaMACHINE was first I wanted to grow as an artist, and then the second thing was that they were in Brooklyn, and then they were moving the company to New Jersey. I was&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to step foot in New Jersey, no offense to New Jersey, but I was just like, &#8220;I live in Brooklyn. The commute is crazy. Getting on the path just to get there, I absolutely can&#8217;t do it.&#8221; This is around the same time that The New Yorker reached out to me, and then this company reached out to me and they were like, &#8220;Hey, do you want to do a test for us?&#8221; I did a test for them. I had my Cintiq and everything all set up, and then my Cintiq broke that weekend-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and I had to use the Bamboo, which is kind of like is still a drawing tablet, but just doesn&#8217;t have a screen. I had to use my Bamboo tablet and finish that animation for them, which is a quick reaction GIF that was like three seconds long. I did that over the weekend and they liked it.</p>
<p>Then, I started working there and the culture was very different. ideaMACHINE&#8217;s culture was kind of like you were doing like a student project. You would have art director&#8230; They would like help you, but not with any direction. The art direction was purely up to the animator. The way that it looked was purely up to the animator. The client would give notes, but it wasn&#8217;t like I had to follow a guide. I was the guide. It was like everything I did at ideaMACHINE from like the music to audio, sound effects and all of that compositing, there we did&#8230; It was a one-shop stop for one artist on each video. It wasn&#8217;t like working as a team really. It was kind of one guy is doing this, and if they need help with the animation, they&#8217;ll ask you, but it wasn&#8217;t anything that was ever felt like a cohesive team effort where everyone is trying to draw in the same style or anything like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm, so it seems like it was definitely just a ramp-up in terms of responsibility, though, right?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, so for Holler, when I first started, I was just doing little three-second GIFs and there&#8217;ll be client stuff, and then we&#8217;ll work on those. Then, later on, I started directing some shorts that they did right before I left. There was one called Akemi-chan: Is It Magical?, which is an idea that I had which was like a play on Magical School Girls trying to do a bunch of anime inside jokes kind of stuff like that. I was writing the script for that and then guiding the people that was working with me of how I wanted it to look and fleshing out storyboards and having more of a commanding role, which felt good, which kind of led to my newest role is sort of still doing that. It was kind of a stepping stone of becoming in charge, taking a step back and letting people do their things, but also helping them grow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hmm. I would imagine even with that, it&#8217;s sort of helping you out in your freelance because you were still freelancing also during this time with Holler?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. With Holler, I was still freelancing. Like the beginning of 2020, like in January 2020, I got a call from Kokila being like, &#8220;Hey, do you want to work on this book?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;This name looks familiar.&#8221; I was looking at the art director&#8217;s name, and then I looked it up and it was the same art director for Hair Love, which I loved Hair Love. It was great. They&#8217;d just had that short come out. It was beautiful with Matthew A. Cherry. I was, &#8220;Wow, I would love to work with them.&#8221; I reached out to them and I was getting started. I was like, &#8220;Man, I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m going to do this with the commute, but I&#8217;m going to try and make it happen.&#8221; Then, of course, the pandemic happened, so it made it a little easier for me to finish my day job and then jump straight to my freelance. From there, every day I was doing illustrations from like 9:30 at night to like 2:00 in the morning-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; just to get those things done, and it was a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, but I mean, I would imagine it changed the way you work freelance, right?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, definitely. Freelance before I felt was more if I felt like I had the energy to do it, I&#8217;d do it-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; but with the book, it was like, &#8220;All right, you got to get these pages done. You got to get these multiple books done. You kind of have to treat this now like a full-time job where you clock in.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;All right, my clock-in time is 9:30 at night to 2:00 in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, that&#8217;s good. You get into doing it, you kind of time box your schedule, it sort of helps out, especially if you&#8217;re doing it on a regular basis.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, something that I&#8217;ve seen at least over the past decade that I&#8217;ve done this show, but I&#8217;d say probably prior to that as well, you started to see a really big increase of Black artistic talent, visual artistic talent specifically. Cartoons, animations, fine art, like you mentioned Hair Love from Matthew A. Cherry. No relation, I think, I think. Any genealogists out there want to dive into that, I&#8217;m more than welcome.</p>
<p>When I see all of this, I also end up seeing this question about representation, like that always seems to come up, which I think is kind unfair that if you are a Black artist that you have to represent your community through your work. I think it&#8217;s up to the individual artist what they choose to do. Is that something that you feel like you have to do through your work? Have you gotten that kind of, I don&#8217;t know, sense of&#8230; I don&#8217;t even want to say responsibility, but have you gotten that, say, from other people, from clients, et cetera?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, I would say there&#8217;s a little bit of that, and there&#8217;s like, for instance, when I first started at Holler, I was one of the only two black people there that was the artist and black people in general. One of the things I did when I started there was like I didn&#8217;t want to get pigeonholed as the guy who you only come to for Black stuff, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
That I immediately just did not draw. I drew like animal characters that I knew were Black or like Mother Earth was a character that had an Afro, but I knew she was Black, but it was like I didn&#8217;t do anything that was explicitly Black because I didn&#8217;t want to get pigeonholed. With my comic stuff, it&#8217;s slice of life, but there are times that I do stuff that is political, but those are very few and far between. Then, my main stance on that is just I want my web comic to&#8230; There&#8217;s a bunch of web comics out there where it&#8217;s just nothing really happens. It&#8217;s just like couples chilling and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>I was like, &#8220;This web comic, I&#8217;m doing it to show that Black people are normal. This is my every day. This is slice of life. There&#8217;s like nothing big going on. No overarching villain. This is just a Black guy chilling. Here&#8217;s a look into this. It&#8217;s not what you normally expect.&#8221; I feel like there&#8217;s that, and then sometimes if there&#8217;s bigger issues, I&#8217;ll just bleed over. Then, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;I have to address this.&#8221; I will-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; but most of it I&#8217;m just the way that I&#8217;m thinking of representation is just like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m just a normal guy on the internet. This is what a normal Black dude is doing-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; you know? Chilling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I like that, and I&#8217;m glad you sort of framed it in that way. You know, it&#8217;s interesting, even after doing this show for as long as I&#8217;ve done it, people will only think Black designers come in one specific type. I mean, that can be whatever that type is what that type is, but I say that to say that there&#8217;s a lot of variety in what people might think might just be a monolithic set. One thing I&#8217;ve tried to do with the show is like, yeah, I have designers, but I&#8217;ve got cartoons and illustrators. I&#8217;ve had footwear designers on the show. I&#8217;ve had software developers on the show. I try to make it pretty diverse in general just to give a sense of what we&#8217;re doing out here in terms of creativity in this kind of digital age. I&#8217;m glad that you framed it in that way. I think that&#8217;s a really good way to look at it.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, that was also one of the things when I did the J.D. the Kid Barber books was the reason I worked so many hours on it was because I really wanted the illustrations to have like an angelic feel or like magical feeling, and to have there be depth in the Black character&#8217;s skin, so it wasn&#8217;t just a gray tone because it was on black and white, but it wasn&#8217;t just a gray tone for the skin and no light. I made sure that there was an airbrush. I showed the details of Black skin so when a Black kid opens it up, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, my skin is beautiful.&#8221; I made sure the skin popped, and that&#8217;s what I was like&#8230; That was another way of what I was thinking of representation, but not in the sense of, &#8220;Oh, this stands for something,&#8221; but just in a subtle way of like a kid opening a book and seeing that Black is beautiful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Who are some artists or illustrators that have influenced your work?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I got the classic Calvin and Hobbes. Loved the Garfield. Loved Boondocks. Maybe it wasn&#8217;t age-appropriate for me to be watching it when I was, but I did love The Boondocks. Strong anime influence. Just a bunch of stuff. Even speaking of The Boondocks, when I was in college, I think this guy is named Carl Jones. He worked on The Boondocks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah. He was in Columbia, South Carolina, for something. I don&#8217;t know what he was there for, and he saw my sketchbook. He was like, &#8220;Oh, let me look at this.&#8221; Then, he looked at it and he was like, &#8220;You got some good ideas here, but you really need to work on your fundamentals.&#8221; From there, I just started working on my fundamentals like crazy, which I reached out to him and I told him that and he was like, &#8220;Wow.&#8221; Then, that was it, That was the last we talked, but he was like, &#8220;Wow, thanks.&#8221; Then, he started following me on Instagram and I as like, &#8220;All right, cool.&#8221;</p>

No, that&#8217;s so interesting. Early&#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t even say&#8230; This wasn&#8217;t even in my career, and I keep sort of making these parallels because you&#8217;re saying some things that line up directly with some experiences that I&#8217;ve had. This was the year, God, I sound so old. This was like 2000 I want to say, &#8217;99, 2000 maybe, but I was palling around on the internet. This was back when Yahoo used to be a big destination on the web for a lot of people.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It had chat, it had games. I mean, ask any elder Millennial about Yahoo Spades, and they will spin you a tale, okay. Yahoo had a lot of these user groups that you could just join or whatever. Very similar to like, I guess, a forum or something like that. They had one around Black comic books that was just called like Black Comics. When I tell you the cr√®me de la cr√®me of Black artists at the time were in there, I&#8217;m talking Denys Cowan, I&#8217;m talking Dwayne McDuffie. Dwayne McDuffie-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; actually gave me a critique on a comic book idea that I had. I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I want to make this comic book about these like&#8230; They&#8217;re ninjas, but they&#8217;re Black, and I&#8217;m going to call it Black Ninjas.&#8221; I mean, I can laugh about it now. This is terrible. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;This is just-</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Oh no.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; &#8220;you&#8217;ve just taken Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,&#8221; which I love, &#8220;you&#8217;ve just taken Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and mapped their direct characteristics onto Black people.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;If you want to make something that&#8217;s your own, you really have to make it your own. You can&#8217;t just copy from what someone else has done.&#8221;</p>
<p>That has stuck with me. I mean, I&#8217;ve certainly taken that advice with other projects and things that I&#8217;ve done, but this was way back in the day. It&#8217;s amazing how even just like those kind of little comments that you get from someone that has been where you&#8217;re trying to go can help just set you in the right direction, that kind of indirect mentorship in a way.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to any aspiring artists out there that are just starting out in the industry? What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Work on your fundamentals, but also when you&#8217;re doing contracts, there&#8217;s a couple of things you need to make sure you have, which is a kill fee. If you finish an illustration, no matter how much percentage of it, they&#8217;ll still pay you what they said they&#8217;ll pay you. That way, even if they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, you finished this illustration,&#8221; and then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Actually, we don&#8217;t want to do the project anymore,&#8221; if you have a kill fee, that would be like, &#8220;Hey, I finished a hundred percent of this project. Pay me a hundred percent of the project.&#8221; No matter what, they still have to pay, which is important.</p>
<p>Then, make sure you have a limited number of revisions. I like to do three revisions, and then if a client goes over that, they pay for that, so like you get these three revisions, then anything else they pay for it. That allows the client to think about it because I feel like if it&#8217;s unlimited revisions, the client is just going to keep being like, &#8220;Oh, what if this was pink? What if this was blue? What is this was orange?&#8221; If you&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Hey, you have three revisions,&#8221; that kind of nit-picky stuff with the client they&#8217;re not going to do because they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, these are important. Let me actually think about it.&#8221; Like, &#8220;Oh, can I just imagine that color in blue or whatever versus asking the illustrator or artist to do it for them.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Then, after that, I would say also save 30% of whatever you get for freelance for taxes because you do not want to get caught with your pants down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are you speaking from personal experience there?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
No, I was able to catch it. I didn&#8217;t let that happen to me, but I&#8217;m always worried. I&#8217;m always trying to save just in case. I don&#8217;t want to end up having to pay too much in taxes and don&#8217;t have any money in my account.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good idea. That&#8217;s a good idea. How do you stay inspired and motivated in what you do? I&#8217;m curious. How do you handle burnout or any sort of periods of low motivation? How do you get through that?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
That, I feel like whenever I&#8217;m in a funk, especially when I&#8217;m drawing stuff, I kind of just doodle a comfort character, which for me is like I love Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic 1 was like one of the first games I ever played. I always draw Sonic, and it helps me get out of the funk because I feel like the funk you&#8217;re usually in is just because you&#8217;re progressing in your mind, but you haven&#8217;t kind of caught up to your hand yet. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, this is looking bad,&#8221; because I know my taste is a lot better in my head and I can visualize it, but I&#8217;m like my mind, my body hasn&#8217;t quite gotten there yet. I feel like if you have a comfort character that kind of helps you put things in perspective, I guess.</p>
<p>For me, it&#8217;s Sonic, which whenever I&#8217;m feeling out of it, I&#8217;ll just doodle a little Sonic and I&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Hey, this was better than what I did before. That keeps me motivated, and I always try to measure myself only to myself. Yeah, there&#8217;s going to be artists and stuff that you look up to, but make sure you just look at how you are progressing so that way you don&#8217;t lose motivation and drawing. If you&#8217;re drawing and then you see another person who just draws something straight out of the air and it&#8217;s perfect and beautiful and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Man, I can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; you just got to like slowly keep working. Just look at yourself and be like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m slightly better than what I was the other day,&#8221; and just keep going.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
I&#8217;d love to have this graphic novel come out and then continue doing stuff in publishing, because right now my job is designing book covers-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; so I don&#8217;t do the illustration or anything in that. I just do the layout, the fonts and everything-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
&#8230; and I feel like that has been a little freeing in order to look at the process, but also pick other artists that will be good for a work or a job or something like that. I guess I give them the opportunity to show themselves.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I think designing book cover certainly is a&#8230;that seems pretty cool. I&#8217;ve seen awards go to just book covers in terms of design and everything, so that&#8217;s a pretty cool gig to have.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m liking it so far. Only three weeks in, though, but it&#8217;s good right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
You can find out more about at akeemteam.com and everything pretty much at Akeem Team, which ironically, that is just like an AIM username I made back up in middle school and I just kept it,</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, it&#8217;s yours. It&#8217;s yours forever.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good, man. Akeem Roberts, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. Thank you for, I think, demystifying a little bit about what it&#8217;s like to be a working freelance artist. I think what&#8217;s probably the most important thing that I gathered just from this conversation and from your story is that this wasn&#8217;t an overnight success. You always sort of had this gift for drawing, and then you cultivated that through college and then through your additional work experiences. Then, you were also freelancing and now you&#8217;re doing cartoons in The New Yorker and you&#8217;re designing book covers and stuff like that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all a process, like you&#8217;ve managed to continue to build your skills up at every step of the way, and I think that&#8217;s something that for most people, particularly for most people I think that are listening, it&#8217;s just an important thing to know that success doesn&#8217;t come overnight. You&#8217;ve really kind of worked hard to make a name for yourself. I&#8217;m excited to see what else comes out from you in the future, so thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Akeem Roberts:</b><br>
Hey, thank you so much for having me, man.</p>

<p>This week on Revision Path, I&#8217;m sharing my conversation with visual storyteller Fred Noland. You might have seen <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/fred-noland" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">his recent illustration work in <em>The New Yorker</em></a>, but he&#8217;s been featured in newspapers, magazines and museums throughout his extensive career.</p>
<p>We talked about navigating work and creativity during this pandemic, and he spoke on an ongoing project of his ‚Äî a graphic novel about professional cyclist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Taylor" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Major Taylor</a>. We also discussed representation in comics, his artistic influences, and his podcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOxEVwG64aCeRvY7O97iowu7ZVPK2K08Y" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Serious Moonlighting</a>. Fred&#8217;s voice and his work are an important addition to the world of visual storytelling, and I hope we&#8217;ll see and hear more from him in the future!</p>
