Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>We&#8217;re wrapping up 2022 by sitting down with the immensely talented Shakeil Greeley. I love that his portfolio consists of all kinds of creative projects, including fine art and writing. Who says design has to be all about visuals?</p>
<p>Shakeil and I started off talking about his work as an art director at Splice, as well as his new role at Spring Health. He also talked about growing up between Portland and Philly, studying at the University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s Visual Studies program, and then landing at GQ doing digital art direction and editorial strategy. Shakeil also spoke about the <a href="https://imaginaryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Imaginary School</a> and the <a href="https://www.aroko.coop/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">&Agrave;r&ograve;ko Cooperative</a> (formerly Design to Divest), and shared how both projects are important to him in terms of community building.</p>
<p>There are so many opportunities to use design to make the world a better place, and I&#8217;m glad that there are designers like Shakeil Greeley who are using their skills to make that happen.</p>
<p>From all of us here at Revision Path, thank you for all your support this year. Next year marks our 10th anniversary, so stick around for what&#8217;s coming up in 2023!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Hey there. My name is Shakeil Greeley. I am a creative director and designer based in Brooklyn, New York. And I use design, strategy, and art to create more equitable, open, and imaginative worlds.</p>
<p>So in my day job, I&#8217;m an art director at a music company called Splice. Although I&#8217;m soon to be moving on to a new role as creative director of a mental healthcare company. In addition to that, I&#8217;m on the leadership teams of two organizations in particular. √Är√≤ko Cooperative, which is a Black owned design cooperative. And The Imaginary School, which is an online learning community and platform.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, that&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
It is. I stay very busy, and that&#8217;s not including any of the freelance work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, how was 2022 for you?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
2022 was frankly not the best year. I think it was a lot of time to just kind of process a lot of things that had gone on. Obviously, 2020 was very hectic for many reasons, as was 2021. And I think 2022, I definitely felt a lot of the emotional burnout from just the large existential events that were happening in the pandemic, and racial uprisings, and geopolitical developments, and such.</p>
<p>But also from just working a lot over the last 10 years basically. I&#8217;m one of those people who always has multiple side projects running and I think I&#8217;ve probably had three or four large side projects running at all times since I was a junior in college. And I think that really caught up to me after a while coming into this year. So it&#8217;s been a year of just rest, and reflection, and de-stressing, and unplugging that has definitely been productive. But I&#8217;m really looking forward to the things that are going to come in the next year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of that, is there anything from this year that you want to carry over into the next year?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I think one of the biggest things is my work with √Är√≤ko, because that has been an ongoing project for a number of years now, and we&#8217;re really getting to a spot where I think going into next year we&#8217;re going to be able to have folks working on that project for the first time. So all of the work we&#8217;ve been doing to kind of reposition because we were formally known as Design to Divest. So coming up with a mew name, new brand direction, and new strategy, all of that work has been really fruitful. And I&#8217;m really excited for that stuff to carry on into the new year, in particular in my kind of design practice and work practice.</p>
<p>But on a more personal note, I think just continuing to be reflective and really take time for myself. Those are two things that I&#8217;m really prioritizing the next year to not overwhelm myself with work, and just maintain a nice steady output while giving myself plenty of time to just relax and enjoy the fruits of my labor a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I heard that from a lot of people this year that I&#8217;ve had on the show that this year has kind of been a bit of almost a rebuilding year in some ways. And I think it&#8217;s because 2020 for a lot of us was just very hectic, aside from the racial reckoning, and the protest, and things that happened during the year. But just the pandemic on top of that with also not being able to travel and congregate and stuff. 2020 was really stressful for a lot of people. 2021, I think we were trying to emerge from it. And now this year, especially with boosters and with mandates becoming lax and things of that nature, we&#8217;re just trying to get back to some semblance of normalcy. Which I think for a lot of people this year that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s been. It&#8217;s been about trying to find ways to move forward when take the lessons that we&#8217;ve learned from the past couple of years on how to live in a more equitable kind of holistic sort of way.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Definitely. Yeah, I definitely feel that. So much has happened, and even heard in a couple of your recent interviews folks talking about the influx of things like clients, and new projects, and all of that after 2020. I know even on our end, we&#8217;re really having time to take stock and be like, &#8220;Okay, what are the kind of clients we actually really want to be taking on, and what are the kind of principles we want to be adhering to when we accept new projects?&#8221; And even for my own personal work I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Okay, I have limited time. I have limited energy, and I have a very specific set of goals I&#8217;m looking to accomplish in the world. What are the actual side projects I should be working on and doing at any given time?&#8221; And the conclusion has been maybe only one instead of the suite that I had been operating with previously.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now I know you mentioned that you are about to leave Splice. But you&#8217;ve served there as art director roughly for about what the past four years or so now. Talk to me about your work there.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So Splice has been a really interesting journey. I joined in February of 2019 and worked primarily on all their editorial and content marketing channels. So that includes the Splice blog, that includes Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, Reels. I also assist on things like video thumbnails and video ideas, and also focus onto things like content planning and content strategy. In addition to that, obviously there&#8217;s a whole art direction side. So that includes doing art direction for brand photo shoots where we are going to go cast 10 musicians from around New York City and shoot them in their own spaces and places, to shooting more kind of advertising focused shoots with sets, and set designers, and things that are a little more formalized.</p>
<p>So my work has really spanned a lot of different stuff in my time at Splice. I even was interviewing artists at one point for the blog, and I&#8217;ve worked with the product team on implementing stuff on the marketplace. So it&#8217;s a wide range of projects. And I think the core thing that&#8217;s interesting that ties it all together is Splice for those who don&#8217;t know is a music technology company. And Splice&#8217;s core offering is a marketplace of samples. So we&#8217;re really a creator-forward and creator-first company, which makes it fun as a creator myself to make work for people who have a creative eye, and have things like taste and know what they think is cool, and what they&#8217;re interested in. And might be working on their own album covers, or music videos, or social media strategies for themselves. So yeah, it&#8217;s been a really interesting journey and I&#8217;m excited to talk more about some of the individual specific pieces.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean it sounds like you were doing a lot outside of Art direction. I mean it sounds like it&#8217;s art direction, it&#8217;s creative strategy, it&#8217;s content strategy. It&#8217;s kind of a lot wrapped up under one title.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Definitely. And I think that&#8217;s part of the startup lifestyle. There&#8217;s always more to be done. And I think that also is tied into our team structure across both the creative organization, but also the content marketing team I&#8217;ve been working with. Where everyone&#8217;s very collaborative and very open to new ideas, which kind of led all of us to flex onto different stuff. So I worked with content strategists who were also making beats and were writers. And I&#8217;ve worked with writers who come up with their own content ideas and whole video franchises and things of that nature. So a lot of things going on, and a small amount of people working on them across the organization. But a really creative team, which is fun always.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me more about the team. What did that look like? You mentioned content strategist doing a lot also.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So the way our team is set up is my creative director, Meg V√°zquez is at the head of the brand organization. And then there&#8217;s kind of a flat structure that sits underneath her. So I am art direction. So that includes all content marketing basically, as well as these larger special projects. We have three designers on the team who all have their own areas of expertise, one of whom focuses on motion graphics and kind of brand design. One of them is a really strong brand owner and ensures that the Splice brand across services from employee merchandise to landing pages all feel consistent. And then there&#8217;s a designer who focuses primarily on growth marketing, and in addition to that we also have a copywriter.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s kind of a core creative team. In addition to that, there are two folks who work primarily on video. And then our sister team is the content marketing team in a lot of ways, where we work really closely with folks who do social media strategy for things like Twitter and TikTok. We have some folks who are really specific into one person runs the blog and is the editor energy for the blog. Someone is really specialized in music education and looking at how we can create different curriculums for people to learn music. I think it&#8217;s about eight or so people on each of those teams. And we support initiatives from across the rest of the organization as many content marketing and creative groups do. So we&#8217;ll take in work from things that we obviously generate on our own in our own editorial initiatives. But we also work with other teams around the company to tell the public and tell Splice users about new features, new pack releases, and just new projects that we&#8217;re working on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the most challenging part about working at Splice?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
This is an interesting question. Because I think there&#8217;s two things that are challenging. One of them is a palindrome almost if you will, of a challenge. But I think the first one is just that it is a startup still, and Splice is still figuring out just where it&#8217;s going to go and what it&#8217;s going to be in the future. And that&#8217;s always something that can be difficult for any organization, especially in the creative side. Because you&#8217;re having to deal with new projects coming up, or things getting deprioritized, or new initiatives getting spun up, and potential for wider company directions to change. So just being really adaptable. That&#8217;s been a challenge that I think I&#8217;ve personally grown from, and I know several people that have also really grown from that as well. But it&#8217;s never easy to have to change what you&#8217;re working on and change your focus with that level of frequency.</p>
<p>And I think the other thing that&#8217;s challenging about Splice but is also I think my favorite part about working at Splice is it&#8217;s a music company first and foremost, and people tend to be very passionate about music. And so naturally, we have a lot of people on staff who are super passionate about music making. Whether they are avid listeners or concept goers, or musicians themselves. And that means you have a lot of buy-in from folks and a lot of personal attachment to the work. And that&#8217;s great, but it can also cause friction at times when people are so personally invested in the work that they&#8217;re doing. So it&#8217;s a challenge, but I think it&#8217;s one that when we can unlock, it and when we can solve it, and when we can really work together in cool ways, it&#8217;s a huge benefit and makes working there really pleasurable. But it&#8217;s kind of a push and pull always there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I have to say, even as you&#8217;re describing it being the startup and then also being something that is really for music lovers and people who love music because it&#8217;s a music company, I would love something like that. I would love to work at a place that&#8217;s passionate about music, but then it&#8217;s also tech oriented, and design oriented. How big is Splice actually? Rough count.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I think somewhere between 200 and 250 if I&#8217;m not mistaken right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, that&#8217;s not too bad. I&#8217;ve mostly worked at startups that have been in that 50 to 60 person range, and that&#8217;s when stuff really starts getting really thorny. Because the old stalwarts that have been there like yourself that have been there for multiple years, and then you&#8217;ve got newer hires that expect a culture that&#8217;s another way. And you&#8217;re trying to do all this together in this kind of fast-paced environment. So for me, it sounds like something I&#8217;d be interested in, but that&#8217;s because I really like music. I was a musician myself for a lot of years. But especially during the past few years we&#8217;ve had, I could see how that could take its toll.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
And I think like I said, it&#8217;s a great problem to have where you have people who are really passionate about the work. But again, I think that that super deep level of passion and emotional investment when tied together with the trappings of a startup and things shifting. And priorities being not in flux all the time, but they do change naturally. I think it can just be a little difficult to make sure that everyone&#8217;s on the same page about where we&#8217;re all going.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s a challenge. But I think if you&#8217;re kind of ready to accept that ambiguity and really be open to flexing and taking on all these different things that you can really learn from and grow from, it&#8217;s an environment that I know I&#8217;ve learned and gained a lot from.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say has been the most rewarding part of working there?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I&#8217;m a real fan of my creative director, Meg V√°zquez. We worked together at GQ as well. And being able to work under her and really see what a good creative director looks like in action has been such a pleasure and an honor. And I think all the lessons I&#8217;ve learned from her and just how to manage a team, and empower people, and solve problems, and ensure creative integrity and all these things are a lot of lessons I know I&#8217;m going to be taking with me for the rest of my career. That&#8217;s been a real pleasure to work with her. And then also it just extends into the rest of the people that I&#8217;ve been able to work with. I think the people at Splice have just been such a pleasure, and we&#8217;ve been able to do some really cool stuff.</p>
<p>One of my close colleagues who&#8217;s a content strategist, his name&#8217;s Ken Herman, he&#8217;s Japanese American. Important context because we were both basically the leads on all social media at the time in 2020. Him being the strategist, me being the designer. And obviously, Splice is a music company. But we are also an American music company, which means that if you&#8217;re reading between the lines, we are a Black music company, whether the staffing reflects that or not. We are a music company that primarily prophets in Black created genres.</p>
<p>So Ken and I were like, &#8220;I think we need to make this a little clearer for everyone here and particular for all of our audience.&#8221; And not that our audience was pushing back on that idea a lot, but we really wanted to make it clear where Splice stood on these issues, and make it clear that we understood the responsibility we had.</p>
<p>So we got to come together and work on a series called As Told By that actually went and became Webby nominated. It was just a small social franchise where we took a specific social issue, whether it was something like the Iran-Contra scandal, or Rockefeller Laws, and went through and found a bunch of textual evidence of all kinds of hip hop artists kind of talking about these issues in their music. And really making an effort to not just&#8230; I think there&#8217;s a misconception for a lot of probably non-Black folks, but Black folks as well around what &#8216;conscious&#8217; rap can be. And folks like Jim Jones talk about the Rockefeller laws. It&#8217;s not just bound by those kind of genre constraints.</p>
<p>So having someone in my team that was super down to work on a project like that, and just do it together, and collaborate on the story, and the design. That kind of working environment I think is a great example of why I love working at Splice and love the people at Splice so much. Just really passionate, really intelligent, and really just down to collaborate and get into the weeds and work really closely together on stuff that they may not know front to back, but are really down to learn and figure it out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds really dope. Actually taking a look at the series now. You covered stuff like the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, the crack epidemic, the Rockefeller drug laws, United States of America versus Billie Holiday, assassination of Fred Hampton, the Iran-Contra affair, the war on drugs. And it&#8217;s all through the lyrics of musicians. Yeah, this is really cool. I have to check this out. This is really cool.</p>
<p>So I want to learn more about your background. I mean, of course we&#8217;re hearing about the creative work, and we&#8217;ll get into what you&#8217;re doing with √Är√≤ko Cooperative and The Imaginary School. But let&#8217;s start with your origin story.</p>
<p>On your website you mentioned that you&#8217;re born in Seattle, but you said you grew up between Portland and Philly, which feels like two wide ends of a spectrum in terms of culture. Portland, Oregon, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah, so I think a lot of my upbringing is a key theme being between different cultures. Because I&#8217;m biracial. My dad, he&#8217;s a white guy from the Pacific Northwest. And my mom grew up in Jamaica until she was about 18.</p>
<p>So they met in the Pacific Northwest and moved to Seattle. So I was born there, lived there for a couple of years. And then we moved to Portland, Oregon and lived a couple of years there. They split up, and then my mom moved to Philadelphia where my grandfather was living with his second wife and a lot of her family. So even over there, that&#8217;s Black Jamaicans, but also Black American side. And then I would spend basically my school time in Philadelphia. And then any vacation time, I would go spend with my dad in Portland. And it&#8217;s two really different places to be sure. Philadelphia, one of the Blackest big cities in America. And Portland, one of the whitest big cities in America.</p>
<p>I just learned a lot. I&#8217;m one of those kids who&#8217;s been drawing my whole life. I&#8217;ve always been interested in art. I think when I first realized that jobs were a thing you had to have, I either wanted to make comic books, or test video games. And I think making comic books or graphic design, not really that different. But those have always been interested of mine.</p>
<p>So I learned a lot from A, being around both really family at the end of the day because my grandmother on my mom&#8217;s side, she&#8217;s a prolific quilter. I&#8217;ve learned a lot about just color and pattern from her. My grandma on my dad&#8217;s side, she is just a broad crafts woman. She loves to do collage, and watercolors, and all this stuff. But neither of them ever did any of this professionally, just purely as hobbies.</p>
<p>And my mom, she&#8217;s a doctor. She&#8217;s an anesthesiologist. And she never really did any of this stuff but has always been really interested in clothing, and home d√©cor, and design. And then my dad is kind of an IT worker. He does all kinds of different IT stuff, but he is also a very passionate DJ. And I think my first kind of real introduction to design was meeting one of my dad&#8217;s friends who was making his mixtape cover art. And he was like, &#8220;Yeah, this is the designer who&#8217;s making my mixtape cover art.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I got introduced to the field really young, but didn&#8217;t really think it was something I would do full-time until much, much later. I spent a lot of time just as any kid does in my age group watching things like Toonami. Part of my upbringing in Portland actually was going to a Japanese magnet school, which is another really key piece of my story. So half the day was taught in English, and half the day was taught in Japanese. And this was right around the big Japan and anime boom of the &#8217;90s. So it was like kids in my second grade class were coming to school with Pokemon cards, and no one had ever seen them before. And the next year, Pokemon, the cartoon went up on WB. And obviously the rest is history.</p>
<p>So Japanese culture and video games, anime, things like that entered into my lexicon really early, and have been a really big source of inspiration since then. So my whole upbringing has just been a real hodgepodge mix of getting introduced to Japanese culture really early, being super interested in mixtape culture, dance hall culture, hip hop culture from a really young age, especially for my dad. And just holding records, and meeting his friends who made flyers, and helping him burn CDs, and things of that nature.</p>
<p>And then I think especially as I went to high school, I really got more into English, and drama, and history, and just writing more so. And I think that whole side of me that&#8217;s more analytical, and research focused, and all about communication merged with my early interests in Japanese culture, and dance hall culture, and all of these things to lead me into at least my adult design career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, that&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
A lot of pieces.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The Japanese magnet school in particular really interests me. I mean one, because you&#8217;re learning about just a different culture. Both language and the Japanese culture. But then to get it at such a young age, especially at the time when in America, Japanese animation was really starting to pop off. Wow, that must have been a wild time as a kid to be a part of that.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
It was really interesting. And the older I get and the more I look back on it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wow.&#8221; It was a public school too. And that&#8217;s a common thing in Portland. There&#8217;s a lot of magnet schools. Looking back on it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Geez, what an insanely foundational and formative experience that was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because I had lots of friends who had older brothers who were into hacking, and modding their PCs, and importing game consoles, and all of these things that I think are super mainstream now. But I didn&#8217;t really understand at the time just how lucky I was to kind of get a front row seat to a lot of this stuff, right as it was coming out because people were going to Japan with their families for the holidays, and bringing stuff back. It was fascinating. It was a very fascinating experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So it sounds like overall growing up you really were exposed to a lot of creative things. And then eventually you went to the University of Pennsylvania, and you studied there as part of their visual studies program. Tell me about that time. What was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So I got to thank my mom for even finding that program in the first place, because I was really kind of torn between how do I do creative stuff and make money. I think the eternal question of any kid whose parents don&#8217;t know what the design industry is. And I didn&#8217;t either at the time. So I was really debating do I do marketing and just do a business program, or do I go to an ad school or advertising school? Or do I go to just a full-on art school and do that? And my mom found this program, which is an amazing program that is basically a hybrid between several different disciplines. Those disciplines being biology, and psychology of sight, and seeing. So how do your rods and cones work? How do images get processed in the brain? These really foundational, biological things are practice.</p>
<p>Our practice, so obviously taking practical art classes like draft design, or painting, or sculpture, things of that nature. And then psychology and philosophy. So really looking at the thinking behind perception, and vision, and the real kind of heady stuff.</p>
<p>And you kind of choose one to focus in. So you take a majority of your classes in a specific area. I focused in fine art practice, specifically design. And then you just get this really interesting and well-rounded experience I think for an academic experience in particular, where you&#8217;re getting to learn a lot of different things that are all tightly related to each other, but are very different formally. I think each person, if you were to just focus on one of those things, that&#8217;s a whole field in and of itself. But we were having a really interesting time learning about the anatomy of your eye, and then having to go into a fine arts class and actually figure out a way to translate that into something visual. Or taking a historical image, and creating a sculpture that reflects the character of the image, as well as communicates the initial meaning.</p>
<p>So it was a really interesting education. And especially as someone who didn&#8217;t take any formal art classes in high school or anything like that, it was pretty wild to be dropped into the real deep end of design, and design theory, and all of these things right as I started school. But it provided me, especially someone with a lot of different interests and someone who is pretty flexible I think, a ton of freedom to just do what I wanted to do and learn about things that I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And I was basically able to do two thesis projects at the end of my time there, just from the fact that I was able to come to the program early. I finished my requirements early. I got a good sense of the things I was interested in, and got to take some graduate classes in my final semester. So it was a really, really great time. Academically. So yeah, very interesting program that I recommend to anyone who&#8217;s really interested in the whole ecosystem of visual image making as a whole entity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now, does Penn still have that program?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
It does, yeah. I believe the head of the program, his name is Ian Verstegen. He was my senior thesis advisor. So shout out to you, Ian.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean that sounds like a really great program. Especially like you said, you have all these different interests. And visual studies may sort of help you find a way to channel that into something.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. And I think the key thing it really taught me was to never make something without thinking about it first. Especially when it comes to design in particular. And always kind of have a thought of what you want something to do or what it needs to accomplish, or the response you wanted to elicit in someone, before you go into actually making the thing. That was a big thing I learned from that program.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you graduated from there in 2015. And one of your first jobs out of college, you were working for GQ Magazine. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So just sung the praises of this program. But it sounds complicated. And two prospective people who wanted to hire, they also I think thought it was complicated, because I could not find a job for a pretty long time. But I was really lucky enough to find this opportunity at GQ Magazine.</p>
<p>So if this was about seven months after I graduated, and I found this opportunity. And it was a web producer job. So it&#8217;s not a design title, not a designer, not a creative anything. It was just kind of a go between for all things within the website. At that time I was still living at home. I was doing some light freelance work, but I was like, &#8220;No, I want to move to New York. I want to get my career started. I&#8217;m going to go and take this job, and I&#8217;m going to go meet the art director first day, and tell them that I want to be a designer, and we&#8217;ll see how it goes from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I was at GQ for three years, three years total. And in that three years, I had four different titles. So I started as web producer, then became a visual designer. Then I was a visual editor. Then I was an art director and manager. And I worked on a bunch of different stuff while I was there. So in my first year, I was hand transcribing stories from old magazines so they could be published on the website. And helping my boss, who was the editor of the website, do her expenses, and keep track of contracts for writers that were doing regular columns and things like that. And I just kind of kept my head down and just kept working on these things, and kept bothering people to give me more stuff to do. So eventually, I started making some small illustrations for e-commerce stories, and then able to do some more big illustrations.</p>
<p>And I think a big moment for me when I was in that first year is I got to make a piece of art for the editor and the chief&#8230; The editor&#8217;s letter? Yeah, the editor&#8217;s letter. And it was about, I think this was in 2016. So it was in the throes of the election and all this stuff.</p>
<p>And it was a piece about Barack Obama, and I just cut together a found image of his bust that I think had maybe been 3D printed by the Smithsonian or something, and Abe Lincoln&#8217;s statue. And that piece went super viral. Definitely the copy was great, but I do think the image had a lot to do with it. And that was kind of a turning point where people really started like, &#8220;This kid knows what he is doing. He knows how to make a brief. He knows how to think through the stuff. We could use him on the design side.&#8221;</p>
<p>So after that, I kind of really started pushing into more of the design world. Eventually they were able to make some space for me over there. And then I spent the latter half of my time at GQ working on Snapchat Discover, which for again, those who don&#8217;t know is, I mean I think it still is active. But it was a bit huge initiative that Snapchat was doing to kind of partner with a lot of legacy publications, and just making moving animated magazines for a younger audience. So I did that for two years, partly as an editor as part of a team. And then I took over the team in my third year.</p>
<p>And in addition to doing a lot of design, illustration, content planning, content strategy, I also got to do a lot of writing at GQ, which is I think pretty unique for a lot of designers. So I had the first interview with Daniel Kaluuya after Out came out with any major publication. And that was a big moment, that was really one I&#8217;m really proud of. And I got to interview a number of musicians like Christian Scott, and [inaudible 00:34:40] and Lil Tracy, and all these people. So it was a really wild ride to be at such a large legacy publication at a time when the money was visibly drying up day by day. So I think it worked for me in the fact that there was not enough staff around, where I was able to just grab stuff and people would just be happy to have someone do it, no matter what their title was. So it really worked out for me in that way. But it was a really interesting time just crashing into that world and having no background in fashion or New York media, and just getting the whole wave washing over me.</p>
<p>But I learned a ton there, met a lot of really interesting people. And really, I think especially going back to my kind of academic background, I taught myself a lot of design stuff even while I was in school. And GQ was the time when I really learned what type design and type setting really meant, and how to really apply that stuff. So I kind of cut my teeth both in the world of multitasking and doing a lot of different stuff at once, but also really getting those hard design skills that I had been lacking in my academic education and self-taught practice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you get a chance to work on any video while you were there?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I did, yeah. I did a number of video projects. I did some design for an Issa Rae video when she was on the Man of the Year issue. And some other stuff with Travis Scott, Kylie Jenner. And I got to do both creating graphics for videos, as well as producing and interviewing people for video too. So I got a whole spectrum of experience in that area.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s some Conde Nast video Style Bible, but all of the videos that I watched out of GQ, Vanity Fair, etc., are so well done. It&#8217;s some of the really good video content. I&#8217;d say even now in this kind of, I don&#8217;t know, short video age when people look at Reels, and TikTok, and stuff like that. GQ is doing some of the best long form, and when I say long form, I&#8217;m thinking, I don&#8217;t know what. 10 minutes or more I guess. But they&#8217;re doing some of the best long form video content out there. It&#8217;s really good stuff.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
And I think actually two of the dudes who I worked with when I was there years ago I think are still there pushing a lot of that stuff forward. So they do some really awesome stuff. And it was a real pleasure to both be able to collaborate with that team, and also just watch them and see how they work. And I think that was something I really just did a lot of at GQ was just watching people, and just seeing how all these people move through the world, and did their work, and how people would just stroll into places they owned it, and were always going to think that they could get access to a certain person or anything. And that was really inspiring to me. I was like, &#8220;Oh wow, I guess I can just go do stuff. If I have GQ in my email, people will just answer my emails back. So I should just try to take advantage of that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I imagine that helps a lot.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. I still get emails to this day of people asking me to feature their X artist in GQ. But yeah, those days are behind me now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now along with what you just talked about with Splice, with GQ, and everything. You&#8217;re on the leadership teams of two organizations, √Är√≤ko Cooperative and The Imaginary School. Let&#8217;s talk about the √Är√≤ko Cooperative first. Because we&#8217;ve talked about it on the show before. As you mentioned earlier, it used to be known as Design to Divest. And we&#8217;ve had some folks on the show from Design to Divest. We had Michael Collette, we had Azeez, we had Zariah. What was behind the decision to change its name?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m actually super excited to talk about this because Design to Divest was this really impromptu gathering when we really came together initially. [inaudible 00:38:46] who was kind of the seed planter who put up the first Instagram post, even when we all came together for the first time, they were like, &#8220;We could change the name and maybe the logo could look different.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know. I just wanted to get people together. And I think that name and that group made sense for a while. And I think we retained a lot of the folks who kind of joined really early. And that felt good to kind of keep the momentum going.</p>
<p>But especially going into this year as we&#8217;re coming I guess&#8230; Yeah, we&#8217;re over two years old now. We had really started to gel a smaller, specific, dedicated team of folks that was just this core group of eight who had been consistently coming to stuff. The steering committee had had as many as 30 members at certain points.</p>
<p>So after a while and really working together week over week, we kind of gelled down this specific group. And once we kind of landed on that core group, we really started to ask ourselves, what do we actually want to do together? And what do we want to do here? And that led us to thinking about questions of what is the right name? Is Design to Divest, a project within our kind of wider umbrella of things that we like to do? We determined that it was.</p>
<p>So basically where we landed was Design to Divest is the first large scale project completed by √Är√≤ko Cooperative. And √Är√≤ko Cooperative is going to be kind of an umbrella organization for a variety of different initiatives that we&#8217;re going to be doing moving forward. So Design to Divest being one of them. And that sits within our core offerings of things like zines, or merchandise, and publishing. We are also going to be doing some consulting work. So we actually just completed our first client project very recently. So there&#8217;ll be case studies about that probably up on our website by the time this interview is up.</p>
<p>And then we&#8217;re going to be doubling down on a lot of community initiatives. So we&#8217;re going to be doing quarterly events that are for Black designers specifically, that are free. We&#8217;ll probably be doing some more open events for the wider design community that&#8217;ll be paid for. And then we have a Discord server, which is kind of just a little bit more impromptu place for Black designers to congregate.</p>
<p>So we really just took stock of all that stuff and determined let&#8217;s put Design to Divest in its own box that allows all of the work that&#8217;s been done by people who are not active in the group anymore to be really properly archived, and separated, and celebrated. And then gives this new kind of smaller group full license to create what we want this thing to be for ourselves, and really just not be bound by any historical things, or previous projects, or any of that.</p>
<p>And just really go from the ground up, working together to come up with a new name, and new brand, and new direction, and all of that together. So it was really just a chance to celebrate some old work and give ourselves a fresh start looking into the years to come for the rest of the cooperative.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Sounds like it was a massive change than just the name. It really sort of changed a lot with just even the purpose. I mean, not so much the purpose behind why you came together. But how do you keep the group moving forward? What are the new goals and things of that nature? Are there other things that have changed over the years now that you&#8217;ve been doing this?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. I think the biggest honor of my design career so far to build this group with these folks. And we&#8217;ve gone through all kinds of changes, whether it&#8217;s going from using Zoom for our meetings and Slack, to moving to Discord, and using that as a primary surface for all meetings, and events, and planning, and all that stuff. To getting a better sense of what our actual deliverables and our offerings. The offerings we want to actually put out for our clients, and determining that maybe we want to do X thing and this thing, but maybe not this thing even, if we have the capacity and capability to do it.</p>
<p>And I think the biggest change too is we&#8217;ve all gotten paid this year for the first time. That&#8217;s a big change. We&#8217;ve been doing it for free for two years, and we were able to get some clients, and get some funds raised. Everyone was able to get a check this year I think. I&#8217;m excited to see my own tax return from the work that we completed this year.</p>
<p>And I think another big change too has just been getting a lot closer to each other as a group, to where we feel really good about just moving forward on new projects without having to have everyone touching everything at the same time. I think that&#8217;s been a big learning development for us is that we have a really wide set of skills in our core group of now nine. And we can divide and thrive. We don&#8217;t need to have eight people on a certain project. We can just have two people on a project, and they&#8217;re going to run it great. And that means three people over here can go and do something else.</p>
<p>So that process of just figuring out our working norms, and how do we operate as a non-hierarchical design entity, and just really figuring out how we can make this thing sustainable for the long term in a way that feels really good has been a series of ongoing changes for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now let&#8217;s talk about The Imaginary School. The Imaginary School on the website is described as, &#8220;An eye on our present, past, and future.&#8221; Where did the idea to start that come from?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So The Imaginary School I think, at least for me in my own practice. √Är√≤ko is kind of the group activity that I really spent a lot of my time with. And it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re going to be doing consulting and making new projects and all this stuff. And Imaginary School is kind of my personal just personal passion project, which is really about education.</p>
<p>So the actual idea of The Imaginary School started back in college with a couple of my friends who were all a bunch of creative folks as well, and we just kind of came up with the name as an umbrella for any collaborations we were going to do amongst ourselves. And we put out one project, and didn&#8217;t really put out any other formal projects after that. We all continued to stay friends, and we&#8217;ve all worked on different projects and stuff together. But nothing really formalized.</p>
<p>And I really wanted to take that, and revive it, and bring some life back to it in the form of more open collaboration with people all over the world, and different interests, and people that we didn&#8217;t have personal connections to.</p>
<p>So in 2019 actually, I spent a lot of time thinking about what the new iteration of this thing could be. And that was spurned by some conversations I had with another friend who was in grad school and who was continuously being like, &#8220;Hey Shak, you got to read this PDF of Saidiya Hartman,&#8221; who I&#8217;d never heard of at the time. I was like, &#8220;Oh yeah, that&#8217;d be great.&#8221; And then, Hey Shak, you got to check out this great PDF by Fred Moten, and you got to check out this from da, da, da, da.&#8221; And after a while I was like, &#8220;You know Isaac, is there a way we can just share this knowledge more widely? Because there&#8217;s so many of these things that are becoming really foundational to my thinking and design process, and I never would&#8217;ve learned about them had you not shared that PDF with me.&#8221; And we were like, &#8220;Yeah, I think we could figure something out.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we really took the idea of The Imaginary School of that open collaboration, and wanted to figure out a way to just open source it basically and make it accessible to everyone. And also something that other people could replicate.</p>
<p>So right now, it is a two-part kind of operation. We have an arena page, which just houses all kinds of resources from across the internet in fields as disparate as video games, to the environment, to Palestine, to parenting and sexuality and relationships. We just have a ton of different information that&#8217;s just kind of crowdsourced and crowd collected. And then there&#8217;s a Discord server which is attached to it where someone can go and find someone to chat about with if they have questions about a particular topic or they found something really interesting and just are looking for someone to chat to.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s this two-pronged approach. And it&#8217;s pretty chill, for lack of a better word. I don&#8217;t spend a ton of time trying to curate stuff and push for engagement on it. I just really want it to be something that&#8217;s easy for people to get into and use as they please. But that&#8217;s an ongoing project for me. And I&#8217;m always looking for new ways to grow it and activate it. So I&#8217;ll be doing probably more of that into the new year as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I see on the website you have some of these discussions that you mentioned. Does doing The Imaginary School and √Är√≤ko Cooperative, do they share similar goals? Do you see there being some overlap between those two?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Definitely. I think any project that I work on ideally shares some goals. And I think in those two projects, just that idea of having a more open and equitable kind of design world is a big one for me. I mean, the most popular channel of our Imaginary School channels is one that is specifically decentering whiteness in design.</p>
<p>So I think there&#8217;s a lot of overlap in the goals of those two projects. I think √Är√≤ko is a bit doing it a bit more active way, whereas Imaginary School is more passive and just trying to get people information so they can reach conclusions and do their projects on their own. But definitely a lot of overlap in the long-term goals of both of those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In recent years, what would you say the biggest lesson is that you&#8217;ve learned about yourself?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I think the biggest lesson I have learned about myself in recent years is that I do not have the energy that I thought I had, is the biggest one. I think even when I was younger and would work all day, and commute, and then come home and work for five or six hours at night into the wee hours of the morning on freelance projects or side stuff, I think I was kidding myself that I could keep that going for as long as I did.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s really the biggest thing is that for me to do my best work and especially do my best work with other people, I need time to unplug, and de-stress, and just not think about design or any of the large issues that are constantly weighing on my head. I need time to just decompress and really give myself time to recover in between really digging into these projects.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think the older we get, our energy levels in some ways kind of naturally wane. But I definitely get what you mean about that, it&#8217;s more about what you put your energy towards, I think also.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think when you&#8217;re younger, there&#8217;s a lot of stuff that you try to do all the things because you have the time, and the capacity, and the space to do all of that. And then as you get older, you just become just more intentional about what it is that you actually want to put your energy towards, what you want to put your name on. That sort of thing, what you want to be affiliated with. It&#8217;s less about doing all the things, and more about trying to do the right things for you.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yep. I completely agree. And as someone who had a traditional education in a lot of ways but didn&#8217;t have a traditional design education, I spent a lot of my twenties&#8230; I turn 30 next year. I spent a lot of my twenties just saying yes to anything I could get my hands on, because I felt like I needed to prove my skills. And also I wanted to develop my skills. And that got very old after a while, especially when you&#8217;re still dealing with commitments that are maybe multiple years old or something like this from when you were younger and a different person.</p>
<p>So yeah, definitely something as I move on is going to be just probably saying no to almost everything. And really allowing myself to just focus on the things that I think are going to make the most impact for myself and for the world. So √Är√≤ko and Imaginary School are two big ones.</p>
<p>I also would love to have a little time to just do stuff for fun. Again, I think I spent a lot of my last 10 years of my design career doing projects for people and with people and always serving as that creative liaison, or designer, or creative director or whatever. But it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve done something that was just for me. And I&#8217;d love to get back to the ideas I had when I was a kid of making a comic book. So hopefully that&#8217;s the next actual personal project I do I complete in some indeterminable amount of time, maybe in the next five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about the comic book. Because that&#8217;s an idea that I&#8217;ve had for a very long time. I&#8217;ve always wanted to do some type of a comic book, or a graphic novel, or something. I&#8217;ve sort of done print design at different times throughout my career. But I&#8217;d say roughly within the past year and a half or so, I actually started working with printers. Because I was working at a company, and we made a print magazine. So I got to really see behind the scenes with paper types and all that stuff.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s a lot less expensive than I thought it was. I think at the time that I was doing it also, there was just this massive paper shortage. Because I would think with masks and with just all the other stuff happening with the pandemic and things like that, everything was in a shortage. There were supply chain issues and stuff. But it&#8217;s actually a lot cheaper to print say 100 copies of a comic book if you just want to test it out. Lot cheaper than you think, or a lot cheaper than I thought at least. I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not a lot of money at all. I could do that.&#8221; I just now need to write it, maybe find somebody to draw it color, and get all that sort of stuff</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I mentioned earlier I&#8217;m hugely influenced by video games, manga, anime, all that stuff. So this also ties into my last thing about taking more time and rest and all that. I&#8217;ve just been trying to a lot more time just playing video games and reading comic books over the last couple years. Because basically in the end of 2019, I was just so burned out and just had totally ran myself dry. And I realized, &#8220;When was the last time I just played a video game for two hours?&#8221; And it had been basically since my senior year of college. So I was like, &#8220;All right, let me take some more time to do these fun things.&#8221; And so I&#8217;ve been reading a lot more comic books and all that.</p>
<p>And the idea I have, and I&#8217;m happy to share this with you right now, is basically make it a traditional kind of battle anime style, where everyone has a superpower, and they fight a big villain, and there&#8217;s big fight scenes and all that stuff. But have it all be based around a community organization that helps their local community by day, and fights the US government&#8217;s secret agents by night. And all of that happens in their dreams. So it&#8217;s all kind of about astral projection. I think it allows for a lot of fun ideas to roam free. With the core idea of this is a group that&#8217;s been fighting the government for years, and this government agency has been suppressing social unrest in people&#8217;s dreams for hundreds of years or something like that. So that&#8217;s the loose idea that I&#8217;m working with, and I really do want to put it to paper sometime soon, because I think it&#8217;s certainly something I would be really happy to read at the very least.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I like that. I like that a lot. That&#8217;s a really good idea. Who are some of the mentors, or colleagues, or people that have helped you get to this point in your career?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I think there&#8217;s one person in particular who is absolutely the most influential. And I mentioned her already, but Meg V√°zquez. She&#8217;s just been so huge for me, I think, and really getting that serious design education. So she&#8217;s my boss at GQ. So we worked together at GQ for two years. We&#8217;ve worked together at Splice for almost four years. And Meg was a part of the Hillary for America design team. So she cut her teeth on all that stuff. And she&#8217;s just been a huge figure for me in just in terms of just getting to know design better, and knowing how to operate, and how to just do design in a professional setting. So really, really could not have done it without her.</p>
<p>And then in addition to her, Charles Hall is another one who&#8217;s really important for me in terms of my creative growth and expression. And he was a TA of mine at Penn in the graduate seminar I mentioned early in our interview. And he&#8217;s an amazing designer, creative director in his own write. He wrote Michael Jordan&#8217;s retirement letter, and just has an amazing way with words and communication. And we&#8217;ve worked on a couple projects together. And he&#8217;s taught me a ton about the industry, and really pushed me as a designer to I think embrace my experiences a lot, and really lean on the things that I know better than other people. So those folks are super crucial.</p>
<p>But I also have to give a really big shout out to just my whole √Är√≤ko Cooperative team. I&#8217;ve learned so much from working with those people. And it&#8217;s hard to put into words I think the amount of knowledge we&#8217;ve been able to build just amongst ourselves in the last couple years. And I think I&#8217;ve learned as much from that group in two and a half years than I have in my four years of Ivy League education. So those folks are all really foundational for me, and I could not have gotten to where I am or done any of this stuff where I&#8217;m at now without the help of the Meg, Charles, and my √Är√≤ko squad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you want to change in 2023?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
In 2023, I want to just be really deliberate and intentional with how I&#8217;m spending my time. I want to be spending my time when I have to be working and making money, doing something that is directly making people&#8217;s lives better. So I&#8217;m excited about joining this mental health company to do that.</p>
<p>And then also in my time out of the office, I want to make sure that anytime I&#8217;m spending doing additional work, it&#8217;s stuff that&#8217;s really important to me and really is serving me in the world. And then just having plenty of time to just relax. So really just making sure that I&#8217;m not spreading myself too thin. In fact, doing the opposite and giving myself a lot of time to just learn, and read, and mess with this comic book, and just chill out a little bit. I think I&#8217;ve earned it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to still be doing? What kind of new work do you want to do? Anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. I think in the next five years, I would ideally be working full-time for myself or in collaboration with some of the folks I&#8217;ve mentioned before. I&#8217;m really excited about this new gig, and I have no idea where that&#8217;s going to take me. But I really have the long term goal of being able to run my my own studio, either by myself or in collaboration with other folks. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m really hoping for is getting the chance to just do that, and have a lot more freedom to go and just build the things that I think the world needs to have out in the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything, your projects you mentioned? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So the best place to find me is just at my website. It&#8217;s shakeil.com. S-H-A-K-E-I-L.com. You&#8217;re going to find everything there. I&#8217;m really active on Arena, so if you&#8217;re looking for a little bit more of a social atmosphere, you can find me at Arena/shakeilgreeley. And then for √Är√≤ko, you can find us at aroko.coop. So A-R-O-K-O.coop. And that&#8217;s a great place to go and get a full sense of what we&#8217;re working on. We have a really large project, which is our design manifesto that&#8217;ll be coming out probably by the time this interview airs. So definitely go check that out. You&#8217;re going to get some really interesting stuff, I&#8217;ll tell you that much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well Shakeil Greeley, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I feel like this interview was a great way to kind of close out the year. One, I think just to hear about the great things that you&#8217;re doing around something that we&#8217;ve mentioned on the show over the past two years, which is Design to Divest, that&#8217;s now the √Är√≤ko Cooperative. But seeing how you are working with something like that and then taking that to move forward into a bigger, grander future, I think that&#8217;s something that we all of course want to see, but something that we all need as well. And I&#8217;m just glad you were able to come on the show, and share your story. And I&#8217;m really excited to see what you do next. So thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me, Maurice. It&#8217;s been such a pleasure and a real honor to be on the show. It&#8217;s an amazing way for me to close my ear up.</p>

<p>Atlanta is a city known for many things: the food, the music, the culture. The traffic! But I don&#8217;t know if Atlanta&#8217;s really ever been seen as a design city like one would see New York or Chicago. That reputation is rapidly changing though, and that&#8217;s thanks to Chip Gross. Chip is the managing director for Work &#038; Co&#8217;s newest office in Atlanta, and with over 20 years of experience under his belt, he&#8217;s helping the city be recognized as a destination for design talent.</p>
<p>We started off talking about his new position, including how it differs from his past roles, as well as the challenges of setting up a new office during a pandemic. Chip also spoke about growing up throughout New England and attending UPenn, starting his career in Chicago, and then moving to Atlanta for grad school. We also talked about Chip&#8217;s experiences at IBM, iXL, Brighthouse, and AKQA, and how those prepared him for what he&#8217;s doing now. Chip has put in the work and now it&#8217;s time for him to take center stage!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
I&#8217;m Chip Gross. I&#8217;m the Atlanta Managing Director for Work &#038; Co.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, how has 2022 been going for you so far? I know you started off this year &#8230; Mentioning Work &#038; Co, you started off with some pretty big news.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Right. Yeah. No, it&#8217;s been a really dynamic time and really exciting at the same perspective. I mean, starting off in January, I guess I decided to make a bit of a change and join Work &#038; Co as we were making a decision to come into Atlanta and establish a space and a studio here. And from there, the excitement has been palpable. The response has been really positive. I think Atlanta in many ways has been awaiting more opportunities to have a company that focuses on digital product design. So it&#8217;s been nothing but good news and hopefully more good news as we roll through more of the year. But it&#8217;s been a lot of fun so far.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I was curious when I heard about Work &#038; Co opening an office down here, I mean, I was excited first of all, but then also curious. Why set up a presence here in Atlanta? Because as people may or may not know, it&#8217;s headquartered in Brooklyn, but you&#8217;ve got offices all over the world. What about Atlanta was significant enough for Work &#038; Co to say we want an office here?</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Well, I think there&#8217;s a few different reasons for us to look at Atlanta as a place that we wanted to put a space or a studio. One of them is &#8230; You&#8217;ll see from the different places that we&#8217;re located, because we&#8217;ve got eight offices globally. That includes, like you mentioned, Brooklyn.We&#8217;ve got Portland. We announced LA at the same time we announced Atlanta. And then we also have Copenhagen, Belgrade, and we also have Rio and San Paulo. So one of the things that I think is a unifying factor around the places that we put our studios, our offices is we want to be a place where we can find really great talent. And Atlanta&#8217;s a place that I think has been underrepresented for a long time in terms of the experienced digital talent that exists here. And having previously been involved in establishing a studio in Atlanta have no doubt that there&#8217;s a lot of really great designers and technologists and product managers that have been looking for an opportunity to work for a company like ours.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
And then in addition, I think one of the other aspects of where we put offices is also in many ways not looking at where we can build collections of clients, but actually where we can also build an amplified culture. So whether it&#8217;s Copenhagen or Brooklyn or Portland or LA, in many ways these are centers of culture. And Atlanta is very much in that same perspective. I mean, we literally have a sitcom named after us that&#8217;s been getting a lot of people really excited about what Atlanta&#8217;s about. I mean, we&#8217;re the cradle of the civil rights movement. All the social activism around that. We&#8217;ve got this outsized impact on music and media. And all those things we feel like are a really rich kind of collection of advantages that I think are really uniquely Atlanta. And yeah, we have, being in Atlanta, this saying about Atlanta influencing everything, and we really do take that to heart. And we think Atlanta is a perfect place for us to position a studio and have a presence.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has it been so far adjusting to this new role, especially with not just coming into the company, but also establishing an office here during a pandemic?</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been different from other times when we&#8217;ve &#8230; Or at least when I&#8217;ve been involved in doing this type of a new studio implementation. I think in many ways we&#8217;ve seen this as an opportunity to think about what does it really mean to create a post pandemic studio. And think about creating an environment in a place where people don&#8217;t necessarily have to be, but they want to be. And creating an environment where people are excited to come and collaborate. Because you can kind of see as I&#8217;m talking I really struggle with even calling it an office. And I really think about this more in terms of creating a space for all of our different team members to be able to collaborate together. And I really lean more heavily in calling it a studio because it&#8217;s a place of creation.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
So whether you&#8217;re creating a design or you&#8217;re creating a collection of code, we want to create a place where people feel that they can come and be part of something bigger and also do it in a way that also creates impact, not just for the companies that we&#8217;re working with, but also the communities that we&#8217;re established within. And also being in Atlanta, I think we want to make sure that we&#8217;re building a studio that also looks and feels like Atlanta, that really does amplify and build off of all the rich culture and diversity and capability that&#8217;s here. And I think that&#8217;s a really powerful thing for us to be able to tap and one of the things that gets me really excited when I think about the possibilities here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s dig into that a little bit more. Talk to me more about your work at Work &#038; Co as managing director. What does an average day look like for you, with your team, with your direct reports, et cetera?</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, it&#8217;s still early days for us and we&#8217;re still in the process of building more of the team. But I guess if there is an average day, because so much of it is defined by what&#8217;s happening in the course of a particular set of projects that we may be involved in. Because we&#8217;re establishing ourselves with &#8230; I mean, we&#8217;ve been in the Atlanta market for the last two years so we&#8217;ve had people that have been here, but now starting to figure out where we physically want be located within the city. We&#8217;re in the process of finding that right place for us to have a physical location. Right now we&#8217;re pretty close to some space in the west Midtown area. And we have been looking at that area because it&#8217;s a very dynamic and vibrant part of the city.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
It&#8217;s in close proximity to all of these great academic institutions, whether it be Georgia Tech, Georgia State, it&#8217;s not too far from Emory. We also have close proximity to the Atlanta University Center. So as we want to become part of the broader Atlanta community, it really gives us a really nice foothold there. So on any day, we&#8217;re in the process of vetting and looking at possible locations to build out the studio. In many cases, we&#8217;re doing interviews and trying to find more great team members to bring on to the Atlanta team. There&#8217;s been a lot of really great interest and excitement from the business community here to learn more about Work &#038; Co and the work that we do and the types of digital product capability that we can bring. So a day for me could be sitting down with a candidate and talking to them about all the potential that we have and the things that we&#8217;re trying to bring into the market. It could be sitting down and talking with potential clients. Also ensuring that our team also has a chance to get together and build some of that culture and community that we really think is going to be critical.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
So I guess for lack of a better way to describe it, in some ways it&#8217;s unpredictable, but in many ways it&#8217;s helping to help us drive this objective of having a really strong presence and even more visibility within the Atlanta community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So the Atlanta office is hiring. Okay. That&#8217;s-</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
It definitely is hiring. We have been hiring. So if there are folks that are interested in getting involved in a company that very singularly is focused on digital product design and development, Work &#038; Co is a great place to look at.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. And of course, for folks who are probably regular listeners of the show, they know that Work &#038; Co also has posted many positions on our job board. Hopefully we&#8217;ll get a chance to expand that to include the Atlanta office as well. I know this isn&#8217;t your first time leading a studio. You were a studio lead at AKQA. Before Work &#038; Co you were managing director at BrightHouse.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at those two and then look at what you&#8217;re doing now, what makes Work &#038; Co a different experience?</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Well, in many ways, what excited me about Work &#038; Co is the fact that we&#8217;re very singularly focused on digital product design and development. I mean, when you think about even our name, Work &#038; Co, the intent behind the name is focusing on the work that you do and the company you keep. So when we talk about the work, it really is focused on a company that doesn&#8217;t do or try to do everything across the spectrum of digital advertising and other dimensions of the digital ecosystem. We really are focused on designing and building and shipping products that we think will transform companies and by extension the world. The founding of Work &#038; Co is very much built on this premise of stripping away things that we felt were not necessarily critical in the aim of doing this work of designing and building digital products.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
So the co side of it, in terms of the company, was really intentionally developed so that we could ensure that we have the right tools and the right abilities to help create the right environment for creativity to flourish. And you&#8217;ll see that even &#8230; If you come in and you work with Work &#038; Co you&#8217;ll see that we&#8217;ve really tried to ensure that we don&#8217;t have people focused on things that take them away from the time it takes to really do the type of level of digital product work that we do. We don&#8217;t do, for example, time sheets. We&#8217;ve been doing this long enough for nine years now, where we&#8217;ve got a really definite and definitive methodology for how we do the work. So we&#8217;re able to have teams that are dedicated to a particular project and don&#8217;t spread ourselves across three or four things at once where we&#8217;re not able to have everybody really focused on what&#8217;s most critical to developing this particular product for this particular client.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
And I think a lot of the work that we&#8217;ve been able to produce really speaks for itself, whether it&#8217;s building an omnichannel experience for Ikea and helping them figure out what their first eCommerce app should look like, whether it&#8217;s working with Apple and thinking about what&#8217;s the in-store experience. And when you think about what today at Apple is, a lot of that was conceptualized by Work &#038; Co. And then we&#8217;ve also obviously spent time working with a wide range of clients in helping them to develop products that we think are game changers and able to help transform the ways that they deliver their services to their users.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you mentioned some pretty big names there. I&#8217;m curious, how do you approach a new project? Like say a client, they go to Work &#038; Co&#8217;s website, they email you. What does that process look like to get started with a project?</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
One of the things that I would definitely say is having been at a number of different digital shops, one of the things I&#8217;ve been really impressed with the process at Work &#038; Co is it really does begin with understanding is this work that we think is going to be shippable. Because as you saw when we talked about kind of the importance of the work side of things, not only want to design and think about how we can create beautiful and dynamic and amazing digital products, but we also want to make sure that they&#8217;re ones that actually come and live in the world. So when we talk about shipping, over the nine years that we&#8217;ve been in existence, we&#8217;ve shipped over 300 different products. So the beginning of our process is really trying to understand, is this going to be meaningful work? Are our teams going to be excited about engaging on this work?</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Is it going to be work that&#8217;s meaningful and is going to have impact? And it doesn&#8217;t always necessarily mean it&#8217;s going to be the most lucrative work for Work &#038; Co every time. We&#8217;ve done work with Planned Parenthood. We did a chat bot that was ranked as one of the hundred top innovations the year that we developed it with Planned Parenthood. We&#8217;ve done work with &#8230; We just released breastcancer.org. We&#8217;ve thought about what are the things that are important for us to be able to invest our team&#8217;s time in? And candidly, in the business development process, we generally have a pretty solid stream of work that&#8217;s coming in. Whether it&#8217;s just through, like you mentioned, the email channels or we have past clients that refer us for work that they think might be worthwhile for us to take a look at.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
In some cases, it&#8217;s a friend of a friend of a friend that knows the type of work that we do. But many cases, we have a lot more work to vet than we end up actually doing, because we really want to be thoughtful and purposeful about the work that we decide to actually proceed with. So once we get to that point, we want to make sure that we shepherd the work through the company and the same level of care, ensuring that whether it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s going to be starting with strategy and working itself into design and then potentially into development. We get all the different stakeholders involved, looking at the work, making sure that we&#8217;re asking the right questions and then building out a scope with product management leading it so that the people that are actually delivering the work are the people that are actually scoping the work, which in other agencies that I&#8217;ve worked in hasn&#8217;t always been the case and in some cases it&#8217;s really led to some problematic projects as a result.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
So again, because we&#8217;re so singularly focused in developing digital product and shipping it, we&#8217;re able to be really, really thoughtful and intentional about how we actually move the work into the company. And we build the right team that&#8217;s going to really be passionate and excited about the work. And then we also make sure that we&#8217;re working collaboratively with the client as we do the work. So we have a saying within Work &#038; Co that we do prototypes and not presentations. And the ways that we actually create and concept the work is through the process of creation and iteration. So we&#8217;re not going away thinking about what this could be, and then coming back to the client and showing them something that&#8217;s in process. They&#8217;re actually working with us in some cases in the Figma files. Seeing it evolve and become this conceptual product and then eventually a detailed design product. And then eventually a product that goes out and lives in the world and helps them be transformative and engaging with their users as a result.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I feel like even with all of that that you mentioned, it&#8217;s super important to have something like that here in Atlanta. And we&#8217;ll get more into your background, but I know just from starting out here as a designer and working my way in different companies and stuff, I don&#8217;t know, the Atlanta design scene has been different from what you may see in New York or Silicon Valley in terms of that level of focus, not necessarily I would say on product, but certainly not in the ways that you&#8217;ve just described it with Work &#038; Co. It almost seems to be a bit more, I don&#8217;t want to say transactional. Actually the word that I&#8217;m looking for is behind. It feels a little like Atlanta sometimes &#8230; And I&#8217;m making a gross generalization here from my vantage point, but sometimes it has felt a little behind. And I&#8217;ve heard this even from other Atlanta design professionals I&#8217;ve had on the show, from friends of mine and colleagues are just like, Atlanta is not there yet in terms of it being a design city like where you would have that sort of variety, maybe with, like I said, Silicon Valley or New York City or something.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
I would actually disagree with that hypothesis because I think in many ways Atlanta has been very much &#8230; And I&#8217;m talking into the context of digital product design and development. Yeah. We&#8217;ve had a number of agencies here and in some cases, what I think gets overshadowed is there&#8217;s a lot of great campaign work and there&#8217;s a number of more traditional advertising agencies that have been above the radar. But for as long as I&#8217;ve been in Atlanta and in this space, I think there&#8217;s been a lot of really great work that gets developed or designed in Atlanta, but maybe it&#8217;s out of an agency that is primarily based in another geography. So a lot of the talent in Atlanta, candidly, doesn&#8217;t get the same shine that it might get in another city like Chicago or New York or Silicon Valley, just because the work is kind of used coming out of those places, when in many cases, some of the design or the development work is actually happening in Atlanta.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s another reason why for us having a actual studio space here will really allow us to showcase and amplify the Work &#038; Co level work that can be done and produced out of Atlanta and also contribute to the work that we&#8217;re doing across all of our different geographies. I mean, again, one of the reasons that we&#8217;re here is because we think and we&#8217;ve seen so much talent that doesn&#8217;t necessarily get a chance to engage on work that happens in Copenhagen, for example, or work that may also take flight initially in Rio de Janeiro or San Paulo. So in many ways, we really do believe that making this connection between the level of work that Work &#038; Co does with the level of talent that we know exists in Atlanta, we think is very much a marriage made in heaven.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Atlanta talent does not necessarily get the same shine. I totally agree with that. Again, I&#8217;m basing it off of my viewpoint of, again, like I said, you&#8217;ve been here and you&#8217;ve certainly seen much more in the creative community, but I definitely have felt it. I&#8217;m not disagreeing with you from what you&#8217;re saying, because I do know that there are several people that may have started out here as design students or started out as designers and then they just felt the opportunity wasn&#8217;t here so they had to go somewhere else. Or they go somewhere else and do well and then now Atlanta wants to claim that in some kind of way. It&#8217;s an interesting kind of thing, but I hope that with Work &#038; Co being here, they&#8217;ll help to really bolster what you said earlier about the creative community here.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
I think so. And I think the secret is definitely getting out. I mean, you hear about a new company every week that&#8217;s decided to build a presence in Atlanta. Whether it&#8217;s Nike or Airbnb, BlackRock or Visa. I mean, all these companies are now coming to the realization that Atlanta really does have something attractive and unique and diverse and something that they can&#8217;t necessarily find as easily in other parts of the country or albeit the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Speaking of which, let&#8217;s talk about where you grew up, which was not Atlanta. You&#8217;re originally from Delaware. Talk to me about growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s not a place that a lot of people necessarily claim to be from. Shout out Joe Biden and Aubrey Plaza as two other Delawareans. But yeah, I mean, I was originally born in Delaware and grew up in Delaware for about the first nine years of my life. My dad actually worked for a insurance company. So as a result, we moved around a good bit. But Delaware was really interesting just because during the time that I was there, Delaware was going through a bit of a awakening itself. And one of the most, I guess, formative experiences that I had was when I was in elementary school and Carter had gone through the process of the busing between suburban and urban areas. And I actually &#8230; My family had moved from the downtown area of Delaware into the suburbs. And then I actually had the unique experience of being one of the few black students who actually was living in more of a suburban area, but was being bused into an urban area to help bring better sense of diversity to the in town schools.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
And it was a really amazing experience and I think it really helped underscore and gave me some perspective on just some of the disparities that exist between both sides of it. Whether folks that were living in the urban communities or even the folks that were living in suburban areas that just didn&#8217;t have the same level of awareness of what it meant to be different. And also the importance of being able to have an appreciation for navigating different types of environments. Whether you were a black student in a white environment or a white student in a black environment, it was a tremendously eyeopening experience and I think something that also gave me a lot of desire to always try and find common ground as I grew up and lived in different places over time. So after the nine years in Delaware, I moved from Delaware to New Jersey, a fairly rural area of New Jersey. Spent a few years there.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Then my parents actually moved from New Jersey to Baltimore, and I had a different experience there when I lived in the suburbs of Baltimore. Then we actually moved from Baltimore to New York City. That was the beginning of high school for me. New York in the mid &#8217;80s was a pretty interesting place to spend time. I think that was another just opportunity for me just to see the importance of diversity and living among a community that was comprised of everything from white Catholics to Dominicans, to Puerto Ricans, to Haitians, Jamaicans. It really gave me a love of that type of environment. And then ironically, my parents moved from New York City to the western suburbs of Chicago. And if anyone out there knows what Naperville and Lyle are like as part of DuPage County, I think it&#8217;s probably &#8230; At the time when I moved there, it was like 95 or 97% white.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
So I almost went into culture shock going from Stuyvesant Town, lower east side of Manhattan to the suburbs of Chicago in an environment where I was literally &#8230; I think I was maybe one of two African Americans in my senior class. I don&#8217;t think there were any black females in my senior class. That was definitely a very interesting period of time. And I think I learned how to deal with a good bit of solitude, but also learned to stand up for myself. I think it helped me develop a certain level and awareness of self that I wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise had if I had remained in one place my entire life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So your family kind of did the whole New England tour. Would have thrown in Connecticut, you&#8217;d had the tri-state area pretty much.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Just about, yeah. And then of course, after high school I actually went to Philly. So I think I decided that Chicago was great, but it was nice to get back on the east coast.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Talk to me about your time in Philadelphia. You were at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. That was another formative experience for me, because if you remember &#8230; And I guess I&#8217;m dating myself. Yeah. I was there in the late &#8217;80s going into the early &#8217;90s so there was this whole kind of black African American awakening. We were dealing with everything from the Rodney King incidents with the LAPD and we had some protests related to that. While I was there, some of my classmates and I actually started a African American newspaper. So I had a chance to get involved in the creation of media and helping to create a voice for the black community at Penn. One of the first times I think we got a chance as an African American organization to celebrate Kwanza. And it was just a chance for us to really kind of say we&#8217;re here and we&#8217;re a vibrant part of the community.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
I remember going to dances and listening to Public Enemy and all of the great beginnings of hip hop music and rap that in many ways were a signifier for just the importance of culture during that period of time. Yeah. I think also being at Penn, it also gave me a lot more confidence knowing that I could definitely hold my own with the best and the brightest, so to speak within the university and also had a chance to just develop some really great friendships that I have to this day. So it was a really great experience and opportunity for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I bet it was fun too, wasn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
It was a blast. I mean, I probably don&#8217;t want to incriminate myself on this-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, no.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Podcast. But we had a phenomenal time and I don&#8217;t think I would&#8217;ve changed anything about that time at Penn. It was a really great time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, after you graduated from Penn, you were working at Hewett as a consultant, which eventually is what brought you down here to Atlanta, right?</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Exactly. Yeah. And I mean, to give the listeners context, coming out in the early &#8217;90s, there was no worldwide web. So at the time when I went to work for Hewett, I actually kind of stumbled into the technology side of things because Hewett was basically a consultancy that helped companies set up and establish benefits and managed 401k plans. And they had actually had a solution that was mainframe based and they were migrating it to a client server environment. And in the process of getting involved in that, I really became that much more enamored and interested in technology. That&#8217;s what kind of peaked my interest in wanting to &#8230; Even though I had focused in economics at Penn, I always had kind of a love of technology. I mean, when I was younger, I played around with Atari game systems and Commodore 64s and all of that just started to become not much more interesting to me. So there was an opportunity to actually go from Chicago where I was working to Atlanta, because that&#8217;s where they were migrating this new technology system. And never been to the south, had always heard good things about Atlanta and decided that&#8217;s where I wanted to go ahead and try to see what Atlanta was like. And ironically, I came down here and just never left.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, you came down here in culturally what I think just had to be such a rich time. I mean, you mentioned everything that was going on in Philly, but then you come down here to Atlanta and I&#8217;m not just talking about Freaknik, although Freaknik is I guess part of the cultural ambiance of the &#8217;90s in Atlanta. But even to just step back and look at where black America was during that time. I mean, we mentioned music. New Jack swing, hiphop, et cetera. But then also the LA riots. And this is a time, as you mentioned, before the internet. How did you feel as a black man navigating through the world at that time?</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
I mean, as a black man in Atlanta, it was just such a welcoming environment to be quite honest. I mean, I don&#8217;t know if everybody has the same feeling. But whenever you&#8217;re somewhere else and you fly into Atlanta, the minute you get off the plane and you walk into the terminal, you can just feel the embrace of blackness throughout the airport. And I think that just extends to the city. As an African American, Atlanta really is in many ways that proverbial Mecca, because the city is &#8230; Depending on where you draw the boundaries, whether it&#8217;s the city proper or the metro Atlanta area, it&#8217;s majority black or just about majority black. Just the amount of culture and just the sense of belonging is really something that you just don&#8217;t get in other cities to the same dimension that you get in Atlanta.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
So being able to come down here &#8230; And again, the context of Atlanta, this was right as the Olympics were happening. So the world was really focused on Atlanta. There had been an amazing amount of investment in building up the city, preparing for all of these people descending on it from all across the world. You mentioned all of the different cultural aspects of Atlanta were also at play. For me again, it was just another validation of the importance of being in an environment and a community that&#8217;s supportive and really embraces you. That&#8217;s one of the reasons why I think I&#8217;ve stayed so long and that I&#8217;ve grown a family here is it really helps to give you a sense of a support system. And it just gives you a sense of love and inclusion that I just don&#8217;t think you necessarily find as much in other places, especially as a person of color.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s very true. I mean, back pre pandemic when I would travel for the show or I would travel for work, nothing to me was more comforting than flying back into Atlanta, coming into the airport. And then you&#8217;re taking the elevator up to baggage claim and you see the black girl with her arms stretched out in a hug. I hear they put her back. I know they took it down for a while because they put up this digital screen, but I heard that they put her back up there. But it&#8217;s just like this embrace like welcome home. And so many people I have talked to that don&#8217;t live here do not understand. They&#8217;re like, Atlanta&#8217;s this, Atlanta&#8217;s that, Atlanta&#8217;s a party city, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I&#8217;m like, I feel so at home and comfortable in myself and in my culture in Atlanta than anywhere else. I mean, granted, I&#8217;ve been here for a long time, but there&#8217;s a comfort here that lets you know this is where you can always come home.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s palpable. I mean you really do feel it as you move throughout the city. And I think that&#8217;s one of the reasons why there is so many transplants to Atlanta because when people come down and they get a feel for that aspect of Southern hospitality, but also that sense of you can be from a lot of other places but still feel at home in Atlanta. And I think it&#8217;s something that a lot of people really connect to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now it&#8217;s 1995. You&#8217;re in Atlanta. You&#8217;re about to get your MBA from Emory. Tell me about that time.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
For me, one of the things I realized as I was working with Hewett was that in order for me to, I think reach my fuller potential, whether I was going to focus on business or technology, was to go and invest and get the MBA. Because I really think it gave me a better and deeper appreciation of what it means to not only build and run businesses, but also all the skills that you need to become a really good leader and be able to help work across different types of teens and groups. I mean, MBA classes are generally case based. So you&#8217;re always getting an appreciation of what it means to work as a team. And I think that&#8217;s actually experience that has really helped me as I&#8217;ve worked through different agencies and when I&#8217;ve been on the client side. It&#8217;s that ability to kind of cross over and build strong relationships as well as be able to think about not only what&#8217;s a great product experience, but also what&#8217;s the broader ecosystem that these products need to live within and having an appreciation for how something&#8217;s going to generate revenue, how something&#8217;s actually going to functionally work and operate. Understanding what it means to, if you&#8217;re working on a FinTech project, understand all the different dimensions of managing assets and dealing with financial systems and cash management, all those underlying processes.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
So for me, I think the value of the MBA was really just being able to understand how businesses work, how you build the best teams, how you develop the greatest ways of people being able to build really great products as a result. Because they&#8217;re inspired and they&#8217;re also investing in the importance of culture and collaboration. So that took me over to Emory to go and go through the MBA program. It&#8217;s something, again, was another formative experience for me and I think it gave me some of the resilience I needed to have as we were starting to reach the beginning of the 2000s and the world was starting to get a better appreciation for what the web and digital actually meant.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s a really peak time when the worldwide web was starting to really kind of become something that is more and more commonplace. I mean, I remember I was in high school going into college right around that time. Actually in 2000 I was in college. But I was in college during that time in undergrad and I remember I was studying at Morehouse. I was studying computer science. And I was telling my advisor that I wanted to be a web designer because I had been reverse engineering websites since I was in high school, trying to teach myself HTML and figure it out. And I really wanted to pursue that. And at the time, I mean, again, this is 2000, I didn&#8217;t know that there was a difference between web design and studying computer science. I thought, well, it&#8217;s all on the computer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s all on the computer. It&#8217;s the same thing, right? And I remember him telling me vividly that, &#8220;The internet is just a fad. If this is what you want to do, we don&#8217;t do that here. We study programming for mainframes.&#8221; And all this sort of stuff. And I ended up switching my major to math after that. But it&#8217;s really hard I think now, especially in 2022, to realize that 20 something years ago, the internet was such a completely different place than what it is now. I mean, the way that technology has grown and changed and evolved the world. But back then, it really was something that not a lot of people really knew about and were doing. But at this time you were working with an interactive agency, right? You were working at iXL.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
And actually even before then. I mean, when I came out of business school, I actually went to IBM. I went into the management consulting side of it. But very quickly thereafter, we kind of evolved into this whole question of what is e-business and what does the web mean in the context of helping companies engage digitally? And it was a fun time because IBM was willing to invest in an internal agency that they call the Arts Cafe for those who remember that time in IBM. And it was kind of this place where we had these quirky designers. And I think at one point we had a three legged dog that was in the studio and we worked on things like the Masters and the Grammys. It was a really great time of exploration, beginning to think about what it meant to create websites and presence on the web.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
And then starting to think about, well, not only doing brochureware and marketing on the web, but how do you actually create wholesale businesses where you then start to get into eCommerce and all the different ways that digital evolved out of that? So for me, being at IBM was a great entry into this whole area of digital e-business and it also gave me an appreciation for what it means to actually build product at scale and build things that have global implications. And you have to think about language and you have to think about the impact of launching products and different geographies with different rules and regulations. And it was the thing that really got me excited and passionate about digital.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Brochureware. I have not heard that term in forever. Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Good reason for that. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. No, but to your point, I mean eCommerce and so many things now that we completely take for granted over the web were just such new things. Like companies trying to figure out how can I conduct business on the internet? Because before &#8230; I don&#8217;t know. Maybe before the 2000s, the internet was essentially a library for the most part. It was basically for research. You would find different university websites or you just find encyclopedias or things like that. It did not have a lot of entertainment value. I know that there were brands that were starting to figure it out because then also you&#8217;ve got technology like Shockwave and Real Player that we&#8217;re starting to bring media into this space. It&#8217;s funny. When I do presentations, I have this slide and it shows, I think it&#8217;s like a Pepsi world from 1999. And it shows the full matrixy experience but then it has something on the bottom that&#8217;s like to take the slow lane. If you have less than a 56.6 kilobit modem or something like that, take the slow lane. And people were like, &#8220;What does that mean?&#8221; Because everything now is like the fast lane with broadband and stuff. But the internet was just such a interesting place. And companies were really trying to figure out how can I be a part of it in some sort of way?</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Oh, for sure. And I think that&#8217;s where you started to see the birth of different digital companies. A lot of them were really driven by who was actually footing the bill. Because you&#8217;d have the very technical consultancies that would engage with the CIO or the CTO. And then you&#8217;d have the traditional advertising agencies that might be engaging with the CMO. And as a result, you started to see your usual suspects start to move into digital advertising and experience at the very minimal level. And then you also had kind of the C-suite. The CEO and the chief strategy officer who might be engaging with a consultancy like a McKenzie or a BCG or a Bain and then starting to come into digital, trying to determine, okay, well strategically where&#8217;s the value that digital can bring. And I think that&#8217;s where you started to see this morphing of companies into this patchwork of different types of digital entities that were all trying to figure out what&#8217;s the right way to come at digital at that time. It was a really, really dynamic time to be watching it all emerge and unfold.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Because things just changed so quickly. And to your point, like you said, there were a lot of people really just trying to figure it out. This is something completely new in a very nascent field. Nobody is &#8220;an expert&#8221; on it yet. Everyone&#8217;s just trying to figure it out.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you&#8217;ve had such a storied career here in Atlanta. I&#8217;m not going to go through all of the experiences, but I will list them out so people can get a sense of &#8230; I&#8217;m going to unfurl the scroll so people can see what your pedigree is.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Show how old I am.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, no, no. You&#8217;ve mentioned IBM. We talked about iXL. But you were at Interland, you were at UPS, Razorfish, SapientNitro, Hearst Autos, and then of course earlier we mentioned a AKQA and BrightHouse. When you look back at all of those past experiences, what would you say are the most valuable things that you learned about yourself?</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
All of them had their learnings and takeaways. I think if you go back to iXL, which in some ways you could argue is one of the first digital agencies that really just kind of staked its claim around digital. I think in some ways it became a little bit indicative of just all of the excitement around what digital could be, but also the crashing reality of going at digital and not understanding the underlying business realities of what it means to run an agency as well as what it means to understand what the marketplace was able to bear. I mean, I think iXL in particular was an interesting experience because there was so much potential and it grew so quickly into so many different areas of focus that it almost just collapsed under the weight of trying to do too many things at once.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
And it was humbling for me because it was one of the first times I actually went through a layoff. That was right around the 2000 with the Y2K and the implosion of dotcoms. And I just never forget the time where I&#8217;d gone through the layoff and I had to go home and tell my wife who was pregnant at the time that I had just been laid off. And I think that experience for me, one, you always remember a situation like that, but also having gotten through it helped me realize the importance of resiliency and that nothing&#8217;s promised and that you&#8217;re going to take risks in this world and in some cases the risks aren&#8217;t going to necessarily work out the way you expect, but you learn from them. And it wasn&#8217;t the last layoff I went through. As a result, I think it made me stronger having gone through it. But it also didn&#8217;t dim my passion and desire to be part of the digital landscape.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
So like you mentioned, from there, I went to Interland, which actually went through its own acquisition and ups and downs and dealt with my second layoff there. But then I got to UPS and it was a really great time for UPS where they were trying to take digital and embed it in all the different processes that they use in delivering packages. So I got to work on integrating UPS technology and Yahoo and eBay. Got a chance to work on what they called their enterprise release process where you&#8217;re doing digital implementations and new feature and product improvements across the entire UPS enterprise. So that also gave me an understanding of the importance of having everybody across the enterprise involved in digital transformation. You were making decisions that could literally lead to billions of dollars in revenue if things didn&#8217;t come together the right way.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
So I think that was maybe another example of where I learned a lot from going through that experience. And then AKQA I think was another really formative one just because I got a chance to start up a studio from the ground up. I was the first employee in Atlanta for AKQA and at the time that I left, we were 33 or 34 people. We had some really great products to look back and point to. And it was a really great way, again, for me to have this confidence of being able to build a team, build a studio, create an environment where we could really do some phenomenal digital product work and also feel like you really were able to show what you could do when there was just, again, that high level of uncertainty of what the future might bring. So I really look back and cherish that experience. And I think that&#8217;s what also gave me that much more confidence now coming to Work &#038; Co of being able to know how to create something and build it and also do it in a way that really builds a great environment for creativity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So your career has really grown and blossomed in the same kind of trajectory as I think Atlanta has grown, not just as a tech hub and a well known startup city, but also as a design city. And you&#8217;re bringing that here with this new Work &#038; Co office and then building off of all the work that you&#8217;ve done. If there&#8217;s somebody that&#8217;s out there listening that wants to follow in your footsteps, what advice would you give them?</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
I think what I would say is one, obviously the earlier points around resilience and once you find that there&#8217;s something that you&#8217;re passionate about, not letting short term setbacks change your desire to be able to pursue them. And I think one of the other things that I think has been really valuable for me is to also have great examples that I can look to of people that have been down that road before and have in some ways inspired me to continue on doing the work that I&#8217;m doing. I think for someone that wants to break into the digital product space, I think there&#8217;s also a good point to be made in terms of all the different ways that you can be part of this company without necessarily being a designer. For Work &#038; Co in particular, in many ways it proverbially takes a village to build really great products and to be able to ship them.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
So that includes having great strategists, great product managers, great technologists. You had Reese on earlier. You have great writers. And then you also need all that infrastructure, whether it be HR or recruiters, marketers, PR. So even though we&#8217;re very much focused on digital product design and development, we have to have all those different skills and capabilities in order to be successful. So one of the things I think that&#8217;s really important is for people to have exposure and visibility to this area and this type of work. And I think one of the most unfortunate things for a lot of African Americans is they don&#8217;t even know that this exists as a career. That you can be a managing director or you can be a great designer or you can be a great technologist and work in this environment. I think it&#8217;s just kind of a shame that there aren&#8217;t more venues like this podcast and like some of the other things that are out there to just give high schoolers and middle schoolers who are coming up an understanding and appreciation for what digital product design is all about.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
So that may be a little bit of a tangential answer to your question, but I think more than anything else, you&#8217;ve got to work your network. Usually there&#8217;s a friend of a friend who knows somebody at a company that you want to get involved in. And I think you&#8217;ve got to be able to have the confidence and courage to be able to work your network, as well as recognize that you may have to take a somewhat &#8230; You&#8217;ve got to come in sometimes through the side door versus the front door and find a way that &#8230; If you&#8217;ve been working in customer service, there might be a way that you could use that to get into the operations side of an agency. And then by doing that, get exposed to other areas that you might want to actually grow into and be able to take courses and develop skills from that standpoint. I&#8217;ve worked with some great designers that actually started off being developers and that they really saw that integration and the intersection between technology and creativity and were able to grow into more senior roles over time. So I&#8217;d say those are some of the points of advice that I would probably give to someone thinking about this particular industry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I feel like I know what the answer to this is going to be, but I&#8217;ll ask it. But what are you the most excited about at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a couple things that I&#8217;m really excited about. I mean one &#8230; And yeah, maybe it&#8217;s the silver lining of the pandemic, but now that we&#8217;ve been through two years of basically self isolation, the level of digitization of every different aspect of our lives. Something that we couldn&#8217;t have even imagined a couple years ago. The fact that we can do almost every aspect of whether it&#8217;s healthcare or managing finances or running a business or engaging with colleagues via Zoom and things like that. We&#8217;ve basically gone through arguably five to 10 years of digital evolution in the span of two. So one of the things that excites me, and one of the reasons why I think it&#8217;s such a great time for Work &#038; Co is the fact that if you really look at all the different developments that have come to play in the last two years, there&#8217;s a digital product designer and a digital product technologist and a product manager behind almost everything that you can think of that&#8217;s emerged over the last two years.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s a really great time to be able to work in this industry and to help create what the next wave of digital innovations and advancements are going to be. So that&#8217;s one of the really, I think, important things that really gets me excited about where we are right now. And I mean, literally society is remaking itself before our eyes and it&#8217;s remaking itself with this veneer and this kind of core of digital from every different aspect of it. And I think so many of the folks that are coming into the space now, their wildest dreams are probably underestimating exactly what&#8217;s going to play out in the next 10 years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the folks that have influenced you over the years? I mean, going from Philly to Atlanta, and again, the long career that you&#8217;ve had here, who are some of the people that have really helped you out as mentors or as peers?</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
How I would answer that is a few different positions. I mean, one, I think from an inspiration standpoint, I mean my mother and father are at the core of it. I mean, my dad, he was raised kind of the later years of his elementary and high school life by an aunt. He grew up in Delaware. And if you know anything about Delaware in the &#8217;50s and the &#8217;60s, I mean, it was a pretty segregated place. My mom actually used to get up in the morning and look across the street at a school that she couldn&#8217;t go to because of the color of her skin. So for them to be able to create the opportunity for me to be where I am, I think is something that I always just take as a point of inspiration that no matter where you are currently, with the right support and the right inspiration, you can really go anywhere.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
So start with that in terms of those who inspired me. And I think we maybe didn&#8217;t talk about it too much, but we really underestimate the importance of representation. Just how important it can be to see somebody in a role that you never envisioned yourself in. And the example I&#8217;ll give you is when I was at IBM, I was in the media and technology group within IBM at the time. And we were at this conference in IBM. They generally had these big sales conferences where they get together people from all over the country. And I think we were at Disney at the time. We were in this big conference room. They were having different presentations, but then they had this one section of the conference where they had an executive come out and the executive was actually John Thompson, who is currently &#8230; I think he&#8217;s lead director at Microsoft.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
And I remember being in the audience and seeing John Thompson walk out on stage. And if you know anything about John Thompson, I mean, really inspirational. He&#8217;s almost the same demeanor as like a Barack Obama in terms of how he talks and just how engaging he can be. And I remember just being transfixed by him walking out on stage, being who he was and being just so moved by the fact that there was this guy who looked like me, in some cases kind of talked a little bit like how I talk, and he was running a major part of IBM&#8217;s business. And then he went on to become CEO of Symantec. And I think people don&#8217;t always realize just how important a incident like that can be. I mean, I never got a chance to really talk to John Thompson. I only saw him for a very short period of time, but that experience for me was something that told me that, yeah, I can be a managing director. I can start a studio.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
I can do all the things that I see everybody else doing because he&#8217;s already done it. He&#8217;s been there and he&#8217;s been able to achieve in an environment that probably wasn&#8217;t very favorable to him being successful. So that&#8217;s how I would probably answer the question about mentors. And then wherever I&#8217;ve been, whether it&#8217;s at BCG, I had Jim Lowry and Justin Dean who were great role models for me as a managing director. When I was at UPS, I had Joycelyn Pearson, who was my boss, a dynamic and phenomenal leader. Those are the things that I think helped me get through those tough times and it helped show me the importance of seeing and knowing from seeing that you can be that person and be successful in any type of environment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, where do you think your life would&#8217;ve gone if you hadn&#8217;t started working in the creative field?</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
For me, it goes back to that point around exposure. Because I&#8217;ve always had an interest in creativity and design. Had I been exposed earlier to architecture as a field, I think candidly, I might have actually gone into that as a career. But growing up, you just didn&#8217;t have that level of exposure to the wide range of fields that are available that tap on the creative side of the brain. I remember when I was at Razorfish and we started to look at some of the other parts of the business and the media side of the business. And you walk into these media agencies and you would see kind of a sea of white faces and in many cases a sea of white female faces. And some of it was a result of people being exposed to things and recognizing that these are places that actually existed that you could have careers. And I think for a lot of African Americans and people of color, they don&#8217;t necessarily have exposure to some of these different fields and areas of possible careers. And as a result, we don&#8217;t necessarily get a chance to develop as big of a body of leaders and representatives in those companies and in those industries.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you want your legacy to be</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
For me, I think it actually goes back to this question of purpose. And when I was at BCG, I was in a part of BCG called BrightHouse and we spent a lot of time with organizations talking about purpose. And I think when you first come out of school, a lot of your focus is on what do I need to do to show that I can be successful and how can I achieve and show my achievements? And I think now where I am in my life, it&#8217;s actually less about let me do things to prove what I can do versus actually what can I do to actually help drive and leave a legacy behind. So when I was at BrightHouse, we talked a lot about personal purpose. We went through some exercises and I ended up with my personal purpose being to live into lead with optimism. When it comes to legacy, I think if I can be an example that other people look to and see that it&#8217;s possible to be a managing director or to be successful in being kind of a quasi entrepreneur and to bring new things into being, that I think gets to my answer around legacy. Being able to help empower others to understand and be optimistic about what they can become and not feel like they&#8217;re limited by where they may be at a certain point in time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work, about Work &#038; Co? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Well, they can definitely find out more about Work &#038; Co at work.co, which is our website. And I think it&#8217;s a great way to see the wide range of work that we do, the different types of careers that we have, as well as the capabilities that we have in house. And if people want to learn more about me, obviously there&#8217;s LinkedIn, which is a great way to connect and get a better understanding of some of the different things that I&#8217;ve been involved in, both on the professional side as well as I&#8217;ve been involved in some non-for-profit organizations too. Like there&#8217;s one that I&#8217;m involved with now called Redefine Ed. And it&#8217;s actually a non-for-profit focused on improving educational outcomes for Atlanta public school students. So that&#8217;s another passion of mine and a place that you can learn more about me and how I&#8217;m involved in the community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nothing about the cars?</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Well, I am a car enthusiast, so you&#8217;ve done your research. And I do like to tinker with automobiles. I haven&#8217;t had as much time most recently, but I&#8217;ve spent some time working on everything from a Pontiac Fiero to a Porsche 944. I mean, right now I&#8217;m playing around with a BMW. So yes, I do like to get my hands dirty and kind of take my mind off the day to day by just figuring out how things work and making them work better.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Sounds good. Chip Gross, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. One, just for sharing the passion that you have behind building this new studio, this new branch of Work &#038; Co here in Atlanta, but also to show just how much perseverance you&#8217;ve had throughout your entire career, how much you&#8217;ve brought to the Atlanta creative community. I&#8217;m really excited to see where a Work &#038; Co really comes from here. But then of course, I&#8217;m really just &#8230; As you talked before about visibility and representation, it&#8217;s good for someone like me to see someone like you doing what you&#8217;re doing. And I hope for people that are listening that they are proud to see that as well. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Chip Gross:</b><br>
Oh, it&#8217;s been my pleasure and I really enjoyed it and hopefully gave some people some inspiration to come and be part of this whole world of digital product design and development.</p>
