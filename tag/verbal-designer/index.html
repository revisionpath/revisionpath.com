Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>Whether you like it or not, writing is an integral part of the design process these days, and no one knows this better than this week&#8217;s guest, Reese Fuller. As a senior writer for digital agency Work &amp; Co, Reese works with visual designers and strategists to help &#8220;make the words sound good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our conversation started off with Reese detailing how he works as a writer in a design agency, talked about his switch from STEM to writing, and cleared up some misconceptions designers may have about including writing in the design process. Reese also spoke about growing up in the DMV area, the difference for him between working in agencies vs. in-house at companies, and gives some great advice and resources for any designers looking to strengthen their writing. Don&#8217;t sleep on the written word &#8212; with examples like Reese, it&#8217;s clear that there&#8217;s more than one way to be in the design industry!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I&#8217;m Reese Fuller, I&#8217;m a writer. I think that sort of manifested as being a brand copywriter in some instances, a verbal designer in other instances. But right now, I&#8217;m a senior writer at an agency called Work &amp; Co.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Now, we&#8217;re in the second half of the year. By the time this interview airs will be in August, my goodness. How&#8217;s 2021 been for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been good. It&#8217;s been a lot better than 2020, I&#8217;ll say that much. But yeah, it&#8217;s been good. I think, the summer &#8230; I mean, I&#8217;m based in New York so the city now is sort of reactivating, as I&#8217;d like to say, in a lot of ways. It&#8217;s just been really good to reconnect with friends, really good to start going out again, just be outside more comfortably. I think work has been going really well, just excited to see what the future holds. Things has just been really positive. I&#8217;m trying to maintain that energy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. And I guess along that vibrational frequency, since we&#8217;re talking about energy, do you have any plans or anything? Anything you&#8217;re manifesting for the rest of the year?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I&#8217;m pretty excited. I got a wedding coming up next month in September, so I&#8217;m headed-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re wedding?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
A wedding of a friend, wedding of a friend [crosstalk 00:04:49]-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, okay.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
&#8230; seen in a while given we&#8217;ve all been hunkered down these past several months, 18 months or so. I&#8217;m looking forward to going home and reconnect with some friends that I haven&#8217;t seen in a while.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah, professionally, I think there are a few really interesting opportunities on the horizon. Some work we&#8217;ve done with past clients over the past several months manifesting into more work, which we&#8217;re all super excited about. So, you&#8217;re to get started on those projects as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, just looking forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was it kind of a big departure? I know Work &amp; Co. has offices in a lot of different cities. They have one in New York as well. But was it a big shift when the pandemic started, shifting from working in office to now being remote?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah, totally. I mean, I started at Work &amp; Co. in April of 2020, just as the pandemic was sort of kicking into high gear. So, yeah, it was a really interesting experience, I&#8217;d say, getting to know people strictly through a Zoom screen, having not met most of the teams and people I&#8217;d be working with in the day-to-day in person yet. But I think, in a number of ways, it was better for me maybe as an individual and also as a writer.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I found that in some places it can be hard to find the headspace or the quiet space to get really down into writing mode, like heads down kind of approach. So I&#8217;ve been able to work from home and just have more control over my space and my time, which really is an interesting and positive departure, I&#8217;d say. Definitely it had its challenges as well, but in a lot of ways it worked out for the better.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I think with any sort of thing like that, especially if you&#8217;ve been used to working in offices and now you start a completely new gig and it&#8217;s at the time 100% remote, there is a bit of an adjustment period to just kind of shifting into that different mind frame. Because, yeah, you have the conveniences of home, but you also have to be able to really, I think, compartmentalize the fact that you&#8217;re working from home and that you can&#8217;t do the same stuff at home that you would do if you weren&#8217;t working.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. No, totally. I started to miss the commute in a weird way, just to speak on compartmentalizing. Just like, be able to change from headspace to headspace, work life to home life. A lot of that happens, or at least happened, for me on the train going to and from the office. So, when your commute becomes walking to the kitchen table and taking a seat, it&#8217;s not too much of a transition.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So, tell me more about the work that you&#8217;re doing at Work &amp; Co.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. Like I said, I&#8217;m a senior writer at Work &amp; Co. I think pretty largely that means UX writing, is how I would describe it otherwise, but it feels like it&#8217;s more than that. I&#8217;ll say, organizationally, we sit as part of the design team but the role itself is super cross functional. I work with designers or strategists or even sometimes the new business team. Generally, I just say what my goal is. The simplest way to put it is that I make the word sound good or as good as they can.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
If that&#8217;s a product, for example, it&#8217;s about making the user experience however we want it to be. That could mean maybe it&#8217;s simpler, or more educational, or more inspiring, or engaging or whatever. But ultimately, just having a goal in mind or a vision for how the product feels and sounds and what it&#8217;s all about, and trying to communicate that, translate that and express that through writing and shaping a design process. That&#8217;s a part of that as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, anyone that has, I think, listened to this show for, I don&#8217;t know, maybe the last two or three years has definitely heard me really sort of beat the drum as it comes to why designers need to write more or they need to start getting into writing. It&#8217;s interesting because, to that end, with this being a design podcast, we haven&#8217;t had any writers on. You&#8217;re the first writer that we&#8217;ve had on the show which, congratulations, making Black history.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Thank you. Truly an honor every day, making Black history.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
As I&#8217;ve done this show and I&#8217;ve gotten to talk with design managers and product managers at a bunch of different places, I&#8217;ve seen design departments now start to include writers more as part of their teams. They may call it something different than writer. They may call it content designer, UX writer, et cetera, but they&#8217;re including writing as part of the team. Can you talk to me about the importance of writing in the design process? Because you said that you make the word sound good, but what does that process really entail in the design process?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. At Work &amp; Co. specifically, I think I&#8217;ve had a really great opportunity to be on a few projects almost from end to end, starting in the concepting phase where we&#8217;re going broad, I would say. Just figuring out the best expressions, most interesting expressions or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Sort of problem we&#8217;re trying to solve with the product, get it down in a detailed design where we&#8217;ve had a number of reviews with a client; or are more settled in on a more specific product vision and getting into the nitty gritty of like, what should this micro copy be? Or, what&#8217;s the best articulation of this ETA? Even down to some extent into engineering and development. We actually build and then ship the projects that we&#8217;re working on, to just sort of availing myself as a resource for any last-minute edits or thoughts from a writing perspective.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
But I think the biggest addition that a writer brings to a project, just a different perspective and a different approach. It&#8217;s like coming from other kinds of writing backgrounds. Just thinking about not just the words but the entire message and personality that is expressed through words in a project. It&#8217;s just a different approach. You hear so often that projects are often made stronger or the work made better by more diverse teams and a number of ways, whether that&#8217;s gender, race or religion. But I think discipline is another degree vector for that type of diversity as well. Just adding a writer to the mix is just a new way of looking at the work.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Today, a lot of the conversations that I&#8217;ll have with PMs or designers might fall under the category of content strategy, others may be more brand expression but at the end of the day it&#8217;s always about just making the work as strong as it could be and do what it needs to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s interesting you brought that up from a diversity standpoint because, yeah, in this case it&#8217;s diversity of discipline but also, I would imagine, it is just a diversity of perspective. I mean, if you&#8217;ve got a bunch of designers on the team, they may still all be looking at something through a specific design eye or a design lens or a design framework or something. You can come in not being, say, a visual designer and look at it in an entirely different fashion that they wouldn&#8217;t have even thought about. That input is super valuable because you don&#8217;t want to have homogenous teams that are just cranking out the same stuff without those sorts of considerations into play.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, totally.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like I say, writing gigs, like I mentioned, they have different titles or content designer, content specialists, content strategies. I think earlier you said verbal designer? You said that? I&#8217;ve never heard that one. That&#8217;s a new one to me. Do you think that it helps to have all these distinctions when it comes to that?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I think so. I think in the same way people will sort of subdivide visual design, specialty or focus whether you&#8217;re a product designer, or a brand designer, or a motion designer. I think, although there&#8217;s a lot of overlap in those skill sets and the tools that you use and your approach to the work, you&#8217;re still approaching things from the same perspective either visual or verbal.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
On the verbal side of the writing side, we begin to make those distinctions as well, like I said, between content strategists or a UX writer, or a verbal designer even. I think those are just other ways of articulating what more specific perspective you might be approaching a project from and what skills you might bring to a conversation. It&#8217;s not to say that you can&#8217;t in a lot of moments contribute beyond that specific role or a specific title even, but it just helps to set expectations and level set on what you might be able to bring to the project.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, what does your creative process look like when it comes to starting on a project? Where do come in the mix?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Oh, it depends. I think my approach, it&#8217;ll vary project to project. But typically, what I want to do is find the person on the project who either is the most senior or is driving the conversation and kind of grab their ear a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I think a lot of the time, whether you&#8217;re a writer or a designer, the experience can be getting brought on to a project in the middle of things. Like, we&#8217;ve gotten feedback from a client already and we&#8217;re just solving this specific ask or, alternatively, it&#8217;s a new project kickoff. It&#8217;s a brand-new onboarding experience for everybody.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
But typically, just trying to find the person or persons who feel like they&#8217;re leading the conversation and sort of getting a sense of place in geography around what the bigger goal of the project is at present and then, after figuring that out, seeing what problems I can be able to solve with words. It can be a very tactical thing like, &#8220;We are in our third set of design feedback on this specific purchase flow, and right now the client thinks that the copy is just too long and uninspiring. So, can you make it shorter and simpler and sparkle a little bit more?&#8221; That is one approach.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Or it could be, on the other end of that spectrum, maybe there&#8217;s a bigger organizational issue almost where the product, or brand even, does not have a distinctive voice, there&#8217;s no documented set of brand guidelines for voice and tone, and maybe using that as an opportunity to contribute as a writer and produce an artifact and object that is super useful and helpful, and it can help put guard rails around design decisions for the future.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, it does vary from project to project, but ultimately it just goes back to trying to solve problems by using words, whatever those problems are.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I would imagine the stuff that you&#8217;re writing, it&#8217;s a lot of different stuff. It&#8217;s copy in terms of &#8230; I mean, I don&#8217;t know. It would depend on what the type of project is, but I would say like actual paragraphs of copy or you may be doing microcopy like alerts or statuses or things like that. Is that how it generally breaks down with the type of writing that you do on a project?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s a pretty big portion of it. I think there are other opportunities as well where we can get in a little bit further upstream and, like I mentioned, be able to define the voice and tone for a brand or product and have that be a little bit more of a high-level output.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
But yeah, a lot of the time it is executions like that where it&#8217;s, here&#8217;s a moment where a user might be frustrated, a pain point. Can we insert a little bit of microcopy or a toast or notification to sort of lift their spirits and usher them in the right direction? And what is the expression of that verbally that feels right for their brand and also doesn&#8217;t take up too much time? That is in a lot of instances copy, executions like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a gig that I worked at recently where I was doing some content strategy work. I was in a meeting &#8230; I forget who it was; I wasn&#8217;t at this gig very long. But I was in a meeting and I remember one of the designers &#8230; I don&#8217;t know. They just went off talking about how much they hated writing. It was because they had &#8230; I think they had started to create some copy and people were giving feedback on the copy. She just burst into this tantrum, like, &#8220;I just hate writing. Writing is not my thing. I hate writing. We really need to have someone else to do the writing so I don&#8217;t have to think about it. I&#8217;m not a writer, I&#8217;m a designer. I&#8217;m here to design. Why am I writing?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Whoa,&#8221; especially because I was the content strategist for that particular project that she was writing about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s interesting how &#8230; I mean, I don&#8217;t know if this is a sentiment shared by a lot of designers, but I would imagine being a design writer or being a writer on a design team like that. Those, I guess, help in terms of not giving the more visual designers or maybe the more front-end people stuff they have to worry about when it comes to, &#8220;Oh, does this sound right?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. No, totally. I mean, although I am a writer, there is a part of me that hates writing too. You know it is work, it is a craft. You know it is something you have to try hard to get better at. But also, a lot of the time, I hate trying to design too because I think &#8230; Maybe share somewhat of a similar experience to this designer you mentioned where it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re trying to express yourself or get something out that fulfills a purpose or solves a problem, but you just don&#8217;t necessarily have the tools or just doesn&#8217;t feel right. Like, when I&#8217;m trying to put frames together and move copy around in Figma and I&#8217;m just not learning the tool. I&#8217;m like, is this deep learning curve? That&#8217;s frustrating.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, definitely, I feel that sometimes too. But I think part of the beauty of, like you mentioned, this sort of shift in the makeup of design teams to include more writers is that recognition of this is balancing the expression a little bit more and making the product feel a little bit more whole and fully considered.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I think about some of my earlier internships as advertising copywriter. I will describe it as those more traditional art director copywriter duos where there is a person who thinks and communicates and expresses themselves visually, that has a dedicated partner who is someone who thinks and communicates and expresses themselves with words, and being the dynamic that hopefully produces more balanced, better work at the end of the day because people, again, approach creativity differently.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, yeah, I think writing is a lot more, maybe debatably, a more democratic kind of expression. I feel like although a lot of people will say, &#8220;I&#8217;m not a writer,&#8221; everyone writes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Well, not everybody, but most people in professional context have to write to some capacity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, you got to write an email.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly, right? Or Slack message. So, when it comes to putting words in a product that hopefully millions of people are going to use and it&#8217;d be helpful or functional for them, there&#8217;s a lot of pressure on those words to be right; let alone, presenting those words in front of a slew of clients and stakeholders.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, yeah, it can be frustrating in a lot of instances, but I do think having writers on the team, again, just balances that out and gives someone the opportunity to own that part of a project as well and also help shape the design process too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You know, it almost sounds like writing is a form of design.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Who would&#8217;ve thunk? Yeah. Yeah, I think of &#8230; I can&#8217;t remember the name of the researcher but there was an experiment where people would see either rounded shapes or more angular shapes and be asked by the research team, &#8220;Would you describe this shape as more of a kiki or a bouba?&#8221; More often than not, people would name the angular shape a kiki and the rounded shape a bouba because I think there is some inherent connection between processing things visually and processing things verbally that we all just begin to understand in a very similar way.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So I do think, to bring it back to your earlier point, that they&#8217;re just two different kinds of expressions, two different kinds of design at the end of the day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you think people misunderstand when it comes to what you do, being a writer in a design process? Is there other things that people just don&#8217;t get?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I think one of the things that I&#8217;ve had some conversations around in the past just to sort of &#8230; I think setting people straight feels like a little bit too intense of a way to describe it but it is a lot more, sometimes it can be, hopefully, than, although I did use this phrase earlier, making the word sound good, that&#8217;s part of what we do, yes, as writers on design teams. But to the spirit of thinking of writing as a kind of design, it really is, in a more holistic way, shaping a project or a piece of design through writing in a way that is bigger than just, does this sentence fit on a CTA button and looked good? Does the type laid out on this headline for your welcome email looked too much?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I think there&#8217;s a lot of moments where &#8230; I&#8217;ve experienced several moments where the design feels like it&#8217;s already set in place and they just want a writer to come in and line edit the copy. But we can really bring, I think, a lot more to a project than that by being brought on at an earlier phase. So, yeah, I think that&#8217;s one of the bigger misconceptions.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I see writing as being super important because good writing engages all your senses. Of course, you read something, you hear it. In a way it also kind of, I don&#8217;t know if I might be stretching this in terms of taste, but you know when you&#8217;ve read something that is difficult to read or it sounds cumbersome or something like that. It just doesn&#8217;t sound right or feel right in your mouth, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But then, even good words that you use can trigger certain memories. Good words can trigger a scent memory, it can trigger a taste memory, it could trigger a touch memory or anything like that. I mean, it&#8217;s really important because there&#8217;s so many words that you can use, there&#8217;s of course slang and jargon. That factors into depending on what kind of project that you have. Writing is just such a really important part of the design process. I&#8217;m glad to see that design teams are really starting to embrace that more and keep writers in the design fold because it is a really powerful part of what it is that we do.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah, totally. And I think, to your point, it&#8217;s also just shaping and communicating the personality of a product or a brand. Like, if you got a welcome email from a new retailer that you just signed up for their newsletter, the difference between, &#8220;Yo, what&#8217;s up, Maurice?&#8221; or &#8220;Hello, welcome to,&#8221; so and so &#8220;Maurice,&#8221; feels very distinct, and that&#8217;s a writing decision to make at the outset.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, in every moment, in every screen where there are words, that is an opportunity, potentially, to communicate something about the product that a user is using. Or, I think more functionally, with more utility, what they can get from it and how to do that. So, yeah, I think writing is really important in that process and in a lot of ways.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I know we&#8217;ve gotten to know a bit about your work and what you do, but I&#8217;m curious to just learn more about your origin story, essentially. You say that you are in New York right now. Are you originally from there?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
No, I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;ve been in New York for maybe eight years or so, but I&#8217;m originally from Maryland.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I grew up in the suburbs outside of DC. Actually, I went to high school at the same high school as one of your former guest, Ari Melenciano.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. We went to school in Maryland together. There, I was really into STEM. I was really interested in physics and engineering. I interned at NASA my junior year. I was at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
That was really fun. But that same year, I had a really awesome writing teacher and writing class. I just, all of a sudden, was really interested in writing as this structural craft. She broke down literally the formula, almost, of how to write a good essay. I didn&#8217;t know that writing could be so structural and formulaic in a way that I was already thinking about math and science and engineering and physics. I was like, &#8220;Oh, now I&#8217;m really interested in writing. Let&#8217;s pivot super hard.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, coming out of high school, I went to school in Baltimore, Maryland, at UMBC. I had some personal life events happen that, in addition to the burgeoning interest in writing, really made me curious about why people behave, act the way they do; why they think what they think. So, I studied psychology and sociology. I did a double major, but I minored in writing and philosophy.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
While I was learning about behavior en masse, I was also doing all these extracurriculars. I was tutoring at the writing center on campus. We had a lit mag called the Bartleby, I was the fiction editor of. I was writing for this online magazine that was about fashion and music. It was like streetwear culture. So, always sort of complementing, or at least I thought, my academics into more research-oriented studies with this extracurricular creative thing on the side.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Towards the end of undergrad, I was like, &#8220;Okay, I want to be in or around advertising in some capacity.&#8221; Maybe I&#8217;m a strategist, maybe I&#8217;m a copywriter. I&#8217;m not quite sure yet, but still really interested in why people think what they think and do what they do, like in groups.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I found this really interesting grad program at NYU in social and consumer psychology, and that&#8217;s what brought me to New York. So, it was really research centric. We did psychology of branding, cognitive behavioral research, just very scientific. Through a lot of those classes my teachers would tell me, it seems like you really are most excited for the essays and those assignments versus the practice research.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, I did a couple internships, consulting and copywriting, just to start dabbling, I think, and trying to make it more professionally as a writer, so to speak. I interned at this digital first political strategy consultancy as a consultant one summer, and then the following summer switched gears to this full service creative digital agency as a copywriter. That was when things started to pick up.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I was working on campaigns, digital campaigns and commercials. We&#8217;re doing a lot of scripts. It was just fun. I remember we did an ad for a quick service food chain where I, I don&#8217;t know, for whatever reason got super inspired and wrote almost like a rap song for their summer promo. Basically, the lyrics were like how to sign up for this promo and get a whole bunch of free burritos. It was just kind of quirky and funny and cool. I had a really good time doing it, and that&#8217;s what kind of let me know, like, okay, this is what I want to be doing, writing with a group of creative people and trying to put a visual expression around it or with it.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
After that internship, I was able to find a job on WeWork&#8217;s brand team. I was the second copywriter they hired. That was a really great experience because WeWork was just an already rapidly growing company with a whole bunch of different kinds of creatives. There were architectural designers, interior designers, product designers, illustrators. Everybody just making stuff to make these spaces and make the spaces really engaging and fun and cool to be in, so I just ran with that for a while. But then, there&#8217;s pretty big org shifts at the company and I started to feel I don&#8217;t really fit in as much as I would have liked to and wasn&#8217;t really getting as fulfilled by the work as I would have liked.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I found an article online about this burgeoning discipline called verbal design at an agency called RGA and send a cold note to the head of verbal design there. We got to talk and I was really interested in this more strategic high-level approach to writing where, instead of writing the tagline or the script for the commercial, it&#8217;s we&#8217;re going to name the brand. We&#8217;re going to think very strategically about what this new sub brand or new product should be called and why, and build a visual brand around that. Or, we&#8217;re going to put together 50 pages of voice and tone guidelines with a really clear articulation of what you should always be trying to do when you&#8217;re writing for this brand, how to do that. Some voice principles, things you can incorporate into your writing to live up to that. I was just really interested in that approach to writing, that kind of writing. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
And then, after that, I want to start working on more digital things. I want to start making websites and apps and chat bots. That&#8217;s what brought me to Work &amp; Co. It feels like it&#8217;s been kind of a windy road and lots of different kinds of writing along the way, but I do, in some way, use all of my past experiences in the work that I do now, so it feels all worth it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. I mean, when you summed it all up, we can wrap this interview up. No, I&#8217;m kidding.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
All right, see you later. This has been great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s go back because you covered a lot of ground there. We&#8217;re going to go back a little bit here.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like college was kind of where you first got the sense that you sort of wanted to be a writer for a living. It was interesting how you mentioned that you first were on the STEM track and then you got introduced to this writing teacher, and that showed you how writing can be very structural and that sort of way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s very interesting because I also was on the &#8230; Well, I mean I was on the STEM track. My degree is in math but I&#8217;ve been writing, oh my god, since a little kid, maybe since four or five, all the way up to now at my big age. I wrote all through middle school, all through high school, all through college, et cetera and people always thought it was weird. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, how was it that you&#8217;re studying math but then you&#8217;re also a writer. How does that make any sense?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What I would tell people is that structuring a mathematical proof is very similar to structuring an essay. It&#8217;s also very similar to structuring a proposal for design services or web services. The certain aspects might be called different things, like what may be called, I don&#8217;t know, the brief inside of a proposal is the same thing as kind of setting up all of your assumptions and corollaries and such for a proof. It&#8217;s very much kind of the same thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting that you really sort of picked up on that structural building of writing. Because I think, probably when most folks think of writing, they think Shakespeare or, you know. They think flower prose or creative writing. I think even that has some elements of structure into it, but it sounds like you were able to really make that distinction between the structure of making something sound good and how that is very similar to a, I don&#8217;t know, maybe like an algorithm or something to that effect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I also interned in NASA. Not in high school like you-</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; genius. I interned in college. I worked at Ames Research Center for a summer, and I worked at-</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; Marshall Space Flight Center down in Huntsville.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Oh, wow. I feel like the more we talk, the more we realize we have so much in common.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
That&#8217;s so funny. No, yeah, totally. I just felt like there was this lightbulb moment where I hadn&#8217;t been thinking of writing at all a structured kind of expression. I think that I&#8217;m hooked on phonics. You know, like in elementary school or pre K even, I don&#8217;t remember how old I was, just learn how to read and write. The basics, the grammar of it all. But even with those simple nuts and bolts, I hadn&#8217;t taken the next step of thinking about how to write at length with form and structure and some sort of, I don&#8217;t know, cohesive, sort of bodily shape to it or behind it even.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, yeah, when I realized that most, if not all, good pieces of writing follow similar tropes and patterns given that genre, whether it&#8217;s a novel or the different kinds of expressions of poems or even the product work that I do now, it&#8217;s like there are best practices, I would say, to use, I guess, a little bit of professional jargon. There are approaches that work. So, yeah, that was just a really big light bulb moment for me. And now, I&#8217;m just so interested in learning more of them and using them to make good work with writing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now you mentioned also you interned at these agencies. You interned at, I think the first agency you&#8217;re referring to was [inaudible 00:35:48] and then after that you were at KARATs, I believe?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, KARAT Creative.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At KARAT Creative, but you also had the shift from working in these agencies to working in house, particularly once you worked at WeWork. And I would probably say, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know, I guess working at Work &amp; Co. was kind of &#8230;&#8221; Do you consider that more agency or more in-house?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I think, I mean, we are a product design and development agency, so I think of it as an agency although it&#8217;s very different than, at least, my other agency experiences-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
&#8230; have been.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there a big difference for you being a writer in an agency environment versus in an in-house environment?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
From my experience, yes. The biggest has been in an agency setting, being able, and encouraged to touch a much wider variety of types of businesses, types of projects. I just feel like, especially at this stage in my career, I just want to soak up as much information and experience as possible, and that&#8217;s why I feel more interested in working at an agency right now.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve worked on projects in industries like genomics or healthcare or retail or the nonprofit space. There&#8217;s such an array of exciting opportunities when you&#8217;re working at an agency. Versus when you&#8217;re in-house, you&#8217;re really dedicated to that one brand, that one set of products, that one mission. I mean, you really get to focus in, in a very specific way especially as a writer. Very deeply understand and appreciate the voice and tone behind the brand of the company that you&#8217;re working with and also mold it and shape and evolve it in a unique way too.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
But I think the biggest distinction, at least that I&#8217;ve experienced, has been choosing between breadth and depth. In my time at WeWork, I think I was there for almost two years, like I mentioned, the org shifted. The focus of the brand shifted more from small businesses and entrepreneurs to midsize businesses, and enterprise clients even.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
That was a big shift, I think, in the kinds of work that we were doing, the ways that we were articulating ourselves and the marketing materials and advertising and even the core product, the website and the coworking spaces themselves. To watch that happen from within was a really unique experience, but I also just wanted to change it up a little bit too, and I think you get that change of pace, which is great, at an agency.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, with Revision Path being the show that it is and the environment, we talk to black designers and developers and creatives and such. And so, I may never implicitly ask them what&#8217;s it like being a black blank or something like that in terms of what they do, but I&#8217;m curious for you since you are the first writer on the show. Being black in the industry, what have your experiences been like as you&#8217;ve furthered on in your career?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I do feel blessed and highly favored. I think I&#8217;m very lucky to have a lot of positive experiences, but it certainly hasn&#8217;t been wholly positive either. I think part of what I&#8217;ve felt in various roles and moments throughout my career is this, like, Reese is here to make the word sound cool, like give it a little bit of flavor. Almost as kind of like the energy I&#8217;ve gotten in some context. Sometimes, and this is just me sort of trying to be honest about my own perceptions of those moments, sometimes that, I think, might be me interpreting that coming from people or just generally what they&#8217;re giving me, or sometimes even what the project needs. So, I think there&#8217;s that layer of like, &#8220;Are you just asking me to do this because I&#8217;m a black writer or is this really what needs to happen?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do people come to you expecting you to slang something up a bit or like, you know-</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; &#8220;Can you blacken this up a little bit?&#8221; Something like that?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. People might say, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t have the cultural permission to do this, so can you do this for me?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. [inaudible 00:40:08] on it.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Right. Exactly, [inaudible 00:40:10]. That has been something I felt at moments throughout my career. But I also think too, though, even other more senior black writers or other black professionals even in the design industry I&#8217;ve seen who, I think in some instances, very clearly have demonstrated a level of performance and excellence that is ridiculous. It&#8217;s like they&#8217;re just so good at what they do, they&#8217;re sort of being passed over for promotions or raises or even more junior people are making more money than them sometimes.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I do think that there is a sort of, maybe not an under appreciation of black talent everywhere, but it&#8217;s definitely an issue that I&#8217;ve felt and also talked, I think, very freely and openly frequently about with some of my friends who also work in the industry. But even with that in mind, I think, especially after last year, it feels almost to be like a turning point or a reckoning moment where the powers that be are at least more aware of, if not eager, to create a healthier culture and dynamic for all kinds of black professionals. That is something I&#8217;m really excited for and glad to be living through, anyway.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Now, say we&#8217;ve got someone that&#8217;s listening to this and they want to follow what you do or they want to maybe become a writer in the design industry. Now, this might be a lofty question but I&#8217;m curious, what advice would you tell them? Are there any particular resources or anything they should check out? Anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I&#8217;d say, I guess sort of related to some of the points we chatted about earlier. Like, there&#8217;s so many different kinds of writing and ways to be a writer in design and technology and make a living. I know people who just do naming, I know people who are really interested and focused on brand copywriting. They just want to do voice and tone guidelines or just want to do commercials, or just want to work in product. There are so many ways that writing becomes a part of the creative or design process.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, I think having as clear a vision of what sort of subdivision of writing you&#8217;re most interested in and building a portfolio around that or making connections with people who do that kind of work, seeing the kinds of projects that they work on and are excited by so you just get a better sense of what really jazz you up. Because I think that&#8217;s really like, the secret sauce is to, as often as possible, just do the things that get you the most excited even if that changes from month to month, quarter to quarter, year to year. Just follow.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
It&#8217;s going to be clich√©, follow your passions. But I think that ultimately is what encourages anyone to show up more fully to a professional conversation. So, yeah, just figuring out what that looks like for you I think is the best advice I could give. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You said there are some people that just do naming and these are design writers, or there are some people that just do voice and tone work as it relates to style guides and thing like that. Okay, I&#8217;m curious for myself. I just wanted to know how do those work? I mean, I feel like that&#8217;s such a specific &#8230; I almost feel like that&#8217;s hyper specific to be a writer and only be able to focus on those small things like voice and tone or naming as opposed to what you have been doing with microcopy and things of that nature.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I think when you&#8217;re that specialized, especially if you&#8217;re freelancing, you can command a little bit more compensation for the value that you would bring. There are examples, great examples of voice and tone guidelines. I think Adobe has a great one online I think MailChimp has online as well. There are examples online of great pieces of work like that, articles.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a brand blog. I think it&#8217;s like how to build a brand that has a series of great articles about different kinds of names, different approaches to naming, just like having your toolkit and your arsenal. But, yeah, there are ways to figure it out in a way. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily work or look the same for everybody, but just trying it out and figuring out what your own process could look like and how you might approach making something like that, if you&#8217;re interested in it, is an interesting way to go about it too. Because I think in a lot of those moments you get to make the rules, really.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
It&#8217;s like you get to brief yourself sometimes because a team typically who would be asking for help with naming might not know how that process really works. So, you get to leave the conversation. Although they&#8217;ll obviously be giving you feedback, you can sort of steer them in the way that you want to go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s interesting.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. You and I are going to talk more about that after this interview because that really-</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
All right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; that extremely piqued my interest right now, so we may have to go more into that. Given where you are in your career, who were some of the mentors and people that have really helped you out along the way?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
You know, I think of all my old managers, really. When I was at WeWork [inaudible 00:45:40] I was the second copywriter that was hired to the brand team, but the first had come from Etsy prior.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
She kind of took me under her wing, showed me so much about product writing in that moment too because we&#8217;re building new micro sites and web activations for the company at the time. But I think really just taught me not only how to show up as a writer and collaborate with different kinds of designers, but how to navigate a company of that size, like a professional setting in a way that was really authentic and special. So, I appreciate that.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah, even moving on throughout my career. A number of great thoughtful managers and team leaders even, that I think overall did a great job of being themselves in a way and having their own creative process. Inviting people to become a part of that and sharing what they knew to work for getting work approved or producing good work, like different prompts or writing techniques to generate ideas even. All of those experiences have just been helpful for me in some capacity throughout my career.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, yeah, literally everybody. Literally everybody. And, again, I say blessed and highly favored, because literally everybody I&#8217;ve worked with has helped me in some way. It&#8217;s just been so great to have that experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is this where you saw your career going when you first started out as a writer? Or rather, when you first got into writing, this teacher introduced you to the mechanics of it, is this where you thought your career would end up?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Not at all. I&#8217;ve veered off course. I&#8217;m somewhere in the middle of the woods and just eaten berries, I guess. I don&#8217;t know. Weird analogy.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
But, no. When I first had that teacher in high school who broke down how to write a good essay for me, I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go to New York and be a music journalist. I&#8217;m going to be on the tour bus with backstage writing down all these really hot takes and his experiences into a really interesting story for The FADER or SPIN Magazine.&#8221; That was the kind of approach that I had.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
But the more, I think, different kinds of writing that I started reading and the more that I started to see writing appear in advertising, or at least think more deeply about the writing that appears in advertising and marketing and on the apps that I was using, in the websites I was reading, I was like, &#8220;Oh, writing words are everywhere,&#8221; so I have so much jurisdiction. It&#8217;s such a wider playground, a magazine or a book.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
That was the turning point for me where I was just like, &#8220;Okay, if I&#8217;m interested in this medium and there are words there, let&#8217;s try and figure out how to be a part of that.&#8221; That was the journey for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there any advice about writing or about your career that is really stuck with you over the years?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. Read your work out loud is a big one, I think. It&#8217;s a lot easier for things to sound good in your head or look good on paper, but when you read it aloud in your voice, you might hear things that you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I think another one is to not be precious or not be a perfectionist. Again, writing is such a democratic, even, type of expression that I feel like when you&#8217;re a designer, you&#8217;re trying to solve a problem, produce the &#8220;right answer.&#8221; But a lot of times there is way more than one right answer, so be really open to other ideas and suggestions from the people that you&#8217;re collaborating with. Just don&#8217;t be precious about your work and your words because it could be better and it could be different. A lot of the time it&#8217;s better, even in a collaborative setting, to invite people into that process and let their voices be heard in a medium that they&#8217;re trying to express themselves in writing as well.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, yeah, don&#8217;t be precious and read your work. Yeah, I think those are the top two pieces of advice I would give.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything that you&#8217;d like to do in your career yet that you haven&#8217;t done?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I have been thinking a lot more recently about submitting more creative writing to periodicals, lit mags, journals. I think that&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve kind of gotten away from. When I was in undergrad I was writing for this online magazine. I&#8217;m the fiction editor of the lit mag at school, so a lot of the writing that I do now is more solution oriented, just like making a project or product as whatever it needs to be as it can be. But I do want to get more into, or more back into, I should say to just more creative writing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Man, we just had a design anthology called Recognize that we started back in 2019, where basically I would give a theme and then people can write essays, basically design essays or design-focused essays around that particular theme.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
For example, this year&#8217;s theme was reboot. People would write essays to that, 3000 words or less. We publish them, we pay them. We stopped doing it this year because, honestly, there was a woeful lack of interest among designers.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the stick [inaudible 00:51:18], I feel like. At least my experience has been, and I think it&#8217;s why I&#8217;m trying to get the pendulum to swing back the other way is thinking of writing so much so as like a tool to solve a problem. It&#8217;s kind of hard to switch gears back into I&#8217;m just going to write more creatively, write in response to this prompt, write to express an idea that I just had. So yeah, I feel that pain. But, yeah, it&#8217;s a muscle that I haven&#8217;t used in a while and want to use more of. I would imagine, a lot of other design writers might feel the same too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, we did it for three years. We had &#8230; And honestly, the pandemic also kind of killed it. I don&#8217;t want to make it seem like it was totally just lack of interest from people. But once the pandemic happened, people were really more focused on surviving, which is fair. Like, please try to live. Don&#8217;t worry about trying to get 3,000 words [inaudible 00:52:13]. Don&#8217;t worry about that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I would say even to this end, probably because things are still &#8230; I don&#8217;t know, information is still changing every day around this, it&#8217;s just not something that folks are super interested in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I initially wanted to do the anthology because back in 2018, I had won the Steven Heller Prize for Cultural Commentary from AIGA. It&#8217;s usually awarded to writers, and I received it as a podcaster. But it got me to thinking about just the power of writing as a designer because it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve always kind of proselytized to designers for years. I&#8217;m like, it makes your proposals better, it makes your case studies better, et cetera.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But the more that I started doing this podcast, and especially once I started really getting recognized for it, which is why we call the anthology Recognize, is that black designers writing ensures that we are in the design history too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s very easy to go into a bookstore, to go on Amazon or something and you can go to the design section. There&#8217;s a lot of design books and very few are by people of color, let alone black people. It&#8217;s not to say that the writing that black designer should do should always be in a novel or in book form, but it could be writing on medium, it could be something where people can see your thoughts long form and get a sense of how you think and what&#8217;s your process is and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to see that because we&#8217;re the next generation, I feel, of design writers out there, and we need to cultivate that. There needs to be a way to let people know that, hey, the only writing you do doesn&#8217;t have to be an email. You can also write about a project, or a thought process or things like that. I&#8217;ve been fortunate to have a few designers on here who are pretty good writers. I don&#8217;t know if they would really consider continually doing the writing, but &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Most recently I had Jeffrey Henderson on, who is a footwear designer in New York, and he owns an agency called AndThem. He&#8217;s been writing on medium probably for a few years now. Just such great writing. I would read an entire book of Jeffrey&#8217;s writing because it&#8217;s about projects, it&#8217;s about his thought process. He weaves his own personal story into coming from Cleveland and everything. It&#8217;s just so good, and it&#8217;s not writing that you see from black designers, but it is ostensibly design writing.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s so important. I mean, like I said earlier, so much of great work comes from passion and so much of writing becomes better when it&#8217;s grounded in intention.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Those things overlap, right? It&#8217;s like if you have an idea that you just feel so jazzed up about, getting that out through writing is what, in my opinion, produces better writing.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I mean, to your credit with having that won award, for me to think about writing as it extends from a novel or a poem to the writing in an ad or in a product even. I think of even podcasting as an auditory, a verbal expression, a kind of writing too. So, I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s too far off base. Maybe a departure from the people who&#8217;ve won the award previously, but it&#8217;s definitely all connected. It&#8217;s like that kiki and that bouba, to go back to what it&#8217;s like. These kinds of expression are all intertwined at the end of the day. So, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want your legacy to be?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Oh, wow. Hopefully, I think &#8230; I&#8217;ll have to say, doing what I&#8217;m doing now but on a bigger level, continuing to work on projects that I&#8217;m passionate about.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I think one of the things I&#8217;ve been able to do more recently through Work &amp; Co. actually is begin to work with a number of clients who are in the nonprofit space. We have the Work &amp; Co. Fund, which is this allotment of a million dollars&#8217; worth of work essentially invested in nonprofits that advance the Black community. It&#8217;s really the agency working to leverage this ability, that the agency has to build and design and develop and ship these digital products to enact positive social change.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Those are the projects that I&#8217;ve worked on more recently that feel the most fulfilling and rewarding to me. I&#8217;m trying to think more about how I can do more stuff like that not only through Work &amp; Co. but extracurricularly as well. I think in five years, hopefully, I&#8217;ll have more of my day-to-day time devoted to projects that fall in line with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I&#8217;m on LinkedIn. Just Reese Fuller. It&#8217;s Reese, like the peanut butter filled chocolate cups; Fuller, F-U-L-L-E-R. I&#8217;m also on Instagram, which is @reesefuller with an underscore at the end, but I don&#8217;t really post all that much there. But, yeah, I try to keep a pretty quaint, minimal digital presence, but I am very responsive. If you shoot me a message on LinkedIn or Instagram, I&#8217;ll definitely hit you back.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
A writer that&#8217;s not on Twitter? Wow.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. I have Twitter back in the day. We could talk about Twitter. I had a Twitter back in the day. I still will lurk on Twitter every so often. I still get my [inaudible 00:58:01] my info but, yeah, just trying to be a little bit more intentional and conscious, minimalize the web presence a little bit. I think only so much output to give and trying to focus it in different places.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good strategy to have, yeah. Wow, Reese Fuller, thank you so much for coming on the show, for being Revision Path&#8217;s first writer on the show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think a lot of what you said about your process and how you work on projects at Work &amp; Co. I think is super important for designers and even developers and other creatives that are listening to hear, to kind of get a sense of what it&#8217;s like to be on &#8230; I almost want to say, the other side of the process. You know, there&#8217;s left brain, right brain, and writing seems to be different from maybe more visual type of work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s also good to note that it&#8217;s clear that you&#8217;ve put a lot of thought into the work that you&#8217;re doing. I really get the sense you have a strong work ethic, and even just a strong ethical core as it relates to the type of work that you do. I&#8217;m glad that you&#8217;re able to just share that with us so other people who may be interested in becoming writers can do that as well. So, thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
No, thank you for having me, Maurice. You know, I&#8217;ve listened to this podcast for so long when I was getting ready and interested in getting into the industry. I listen to you and your guests chat about their experience. It taught me so much as well. So, yeah, it feels amazing to have that all come full circle and hopefully give some of that back to folks today. So, yeah, thank you for having me on. It&#8217;s really been an honor, and I&#8217;ve enjoyed it.</p>
