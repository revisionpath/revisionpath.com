Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>Whether you like it or not, writing is an integral part of the design process these days, and no one knows this better than this week&#8217;s guest, Reese Fuller. As a senior writer for digital agency Work &amp; Co, Reese works with visual designers and strategists to help &#8220;make the words sound good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our conversation started off with Reese detailing how he works as a writer in a design agency, talked about his switch from STEM to writing, and cleared up some misconceptions designers may have about including writing in the design process. Reese also spoke about growing up in the DMV area, the difference for him between working in agencies vs. in-house at companies, and gives some great advice and resources for any designers looking to strengthen their writing. Don&#8217;t sleep on the written word &#8212; with examples like Reese, it&#8217;s clear that there&#8217;s more than one way to be in the design industry!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I&#8217;m Reese Fuller, I&#8217;m a writer. I think that sort of manifested as being a brand copywriter in some instances, a verbal designer in other instances. But right now, I&#8217;m a senior writer at an agency called Work &amp; Co.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Now, we&#8217;re in the second half of the year. By the time this interview airs will be in August, my goodness. How&#8217;s 2021 been for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been good. It&#8217;s been a lot better than 2020, I&#8217;ll say that much. But yeah, it&#8217;s been good. I think, the summer &#8230; I mean, I&#8217;m based in New York so the city now is sort of reactivating, as I&#8217;d like to say, in a lot of ways. It&#8217;s just been really good to reconnect with friends, really good to start going out again, just be outside more comfortably. I think work has been going really well, just excited to see what the future holds. Things has just been really positive. I&#8217;m trying to maintain that energy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. And I guess along that vibrational frequency, since we&#8217;re talking about energy, do you have any plans or anything? Anything you&#8217;re manifesting for the rest of the year?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I&#8217;m pretty excited. I got a wedding coming up next month in September, so I&#8217;m headed-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re wedding?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
A wedding of a friend, wedding of a friend [crosstalk 00:04:49]-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, okay.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
&#8230; seen in a while given we&#8217;ve all been hunkered down these past several months, 18 months or so. I&#8217;m looking forward to going home and reconnect with some friends that I haven&#8217;t seen in a while.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah, professionally, I think there are a few really interesting opportunities on the horizon. Some work we&#8217;ve done with past clients over the past several months manifesting into more work, which we&#8217;re all super excited about. So, you&#8217;re to get started on those projects as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, just looking forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was it kind of a big departure? I know Work &amp; Co. has offices in a lot of different cities. They have one in New York as well. But was it a big shift when the pandemic started, shifting from working in office to now being remote?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah, totally. I mean, I started at Work &amp; Co. in April of 2020, just as the pandemic was sort of kicking into high gear. So, yeah, it was a really interesting experience, I&#8217;d say, getting to know people strictly through a Zoom screen, having not met most of the teams and people I&#8217;d be working with in the day-to-day in person yet. But I think, in a number of ways, it was better for me maybe as an individual and also as a writer.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I found that in some places it can be hard to find the headspace or the quiet space to get really down into writing mode, like heads down kind of approach. So I&#8217;ve been able to work from home and just have more control over my space and my time, which really is an interesting and positive departure, I&#8217;d say. Definitely it had its challenges as well, but in a lot of ways it worked out for the better.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I think with any sort of thing like that, especially if you&#8217;ve been used to working in offices and now you start a completely new gig and it&#8217;s at the time 100% remote, there is a bit of an adjustment period to just kind of shifting into that different mind frame. Because, yeah, you have the conveniences of home, but you also have to be able to really, I think, compartmentalize the fact that you&#8217;re working from home and that you can&#8217;t do the same stuff at home that you would do if you weren&#8217;t working.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. No, totally. I started to miss the commute in a weird way, just to speak on compartmentalizing. Just like, be able to change from headspace to headspace, work life to home life. A lot of that happens, or at least happened, for me on the train going to and from the office. So, when your commute becomes walking to the kitchen table and taking a seat, it&#8217;s not too much of a transition.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So, tell me more about the work that you&#8217;re doing at Work &amp; Co.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. Like I said, I&#8217;m a senior writer at Work &amp; Co. I think pretty largely that means UX writing, is how I would describe it otherwise, but it feels like it&#8217;s more than that. I&#8217;ll say, organizationally, we sit as part of the design team but the role itself is super cross functional. I work with designers or strategists or even sometimes the new business team. Generally, I just say what my goal is. The simplest way to put it is that I make the word sound good or as good as they can.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
If that&#8217;s a product, for example, it&#8217;s about making the user experience however we want it to be. That could mean maybe it&#8217;s simpler, or more educational, or more inspiring, or engaging or whatever. But ultimately, just having a goal in mind or a vision for how the product feels and sounds and what it&#8217;s all about, and trying to communicate that, translate that and express that through writing and shaping a design process. That&#8217;s a part of that as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, anyone that has, I think, listened to this show for, I don&#8217;t know, maybe the last two or three years has definitely heard me really sort of beat the drum as it comes to why designers need to write more or they need to start getting into writing. It&#8217;s interesting because, to that end, with this being a design podcast, we haven&#8217;t had any writers on. You&#8217;re the first writer that we&#8217;ve had on the show which, congratulations, making Black history.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Thank you. Truly an honor every day, making Black history.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
As I&#8217;ve done this show and I&#8217;ve gotten to talk with design managers and product managers at a bunch of different places, I&#8217;ve seen design departments now start to include writers more as part of their teams. They may call it something different than writer. They may call it content designer, UX writer, et cetera, but they&#8217;re including writing as part of the team. Can you talk to me about the importance of writing in the design process? Because you said that you make the word sound good, but what does that process really entail in the design process?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. At Work &amp; Co. specifically, I think I&#8217;ve had a really great opportunity to be on a few projects almost from end to end, starting in the concepting phase where we&#8217;re going broad, I would say. Just figuring out the best expressions, most interesting expressions or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Sort of problem we&#8217;re trying to solve with the product, get it down in a detailed design where we&#8217;ve had a number of reviews with a client; or are more settled in on a more specific product vision and getting into the nitty gritty of like, what should this micro copy be? Or, what&#8217;s the best articulation of this ETA? Even down to some extent into engineering and development. We actually build and then ship the projects that we&#8217;re working on, to just sort of availing myself as a resource for any last-minute edits or thoughts from a writing perspective.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
But I think the biggest addition that a writer brings to a project, just a different perspective and a different approach. It&#8217;s like coming from other kinds of writing backgrounds. Just thinking about not just the words but the entire message and personality that is expressed through words in a project. It&#8217;s just a different approach. You hear so often that projects are often made stronger or the work made better by more diverse teams and a number of ways, whether that&#8217;s gender, race or religion. But I think discipline is another degree vector for that type of diversity as well. Just adding a writer to the mix is just a new way of looking at the work.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Today, a lot of the conversations that I&#8217;ll have with PMs or designers might fall under the category of content strategy, others may be more brand expression but at the end of the day it&#8217;s always about just making the work as strong as it could be and do what it needs to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s interesting you brought that up from a diversity standpoint because, yeah, in this case it&#8217;s diversity of discipline but also, I would imagine, it is just a diversity of perspective. I mean, if you&#8217;ve got a bunch of designers on the team, they may still all be looking at something through a specific design eye or a design lens or a design framework or something. You can come in not being, say, a visual designer and look at it in an entirely different fashion that they wouldn&#8217;t have even thought about. That input is super valuable because you don&#8217;t want to have homogenous teams that are just cranking out the same stuff without those sorts of considerations into play.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, totally.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like I say, writing gigs, like I mentioned, they have different titles or content designer, content specialists, content strategies. I think earlier you said verbal designer? You said that? I&#8217;ve never heard that one. That&#8217;s a new one to me. Do you think that it helps to have all these distinctions when it comes to that?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I think so. I think in the same way people will sort of subdivide visual design, specialty or focus whether you&#8217;re a product designer, or a brand designer, or a motion designer. I think, although there&#8217;s a lot of overlap in those skill sets and the tools that you use and your approach to the work, you&#8217;re still approaching things from the same perspective either visual or verbal.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
On the verbal side of the writing side, we begin to make those distinctions as well, like I said, between content strategists or a UX writer, or a verbal designer even. I think those are just other ways of articulating what more specific perspective you might be approaching a project from and what skills you might bring to a conversation. It&#8217;s not to say that you can&#8217;t in a lot of moments contribute beyond that specific role or a specific title even, but it just helps to set expectations and level set on what you might be able to bring to the project.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, what does your creative process look like when it comes to starting on a project? Where do come in the mix?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Oh, it depends. I think my approach, it&#8217;ll vary project to project. But typically, what I want to do is find the person on the project who either is the most senior or is driving the conversation and kind of grab their ear a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I think a lot of the time, whether you&#8217;re a writer or a designer, the experience can be getting brought on to a project in the middle of things. Like, we&#8217;ve gotten feedback from a client already and we&#8217;re just solving this specific ask or, alternatively, it&#8217;s a new project kickoff. It&#8217;s a brand-new onboarding experience for everybody.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
But typically, just trying to find the person or persons who feel like they&#8217;re leading the conversation and sort of getting a sense of place in geography around what the bigger goal of the project is at present and then, after figuring that out, seeing what problems I can be able to solve with words. It can be a very tactical thing like, &#8220;We are in our third set of design feedback on this specific purchase flow, and right now the client thinks that the copy is just too long and uninspiring. So, can you make it shorter and simpler and sparkle a little bit more?&#8221; That is one approach.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Or it could be, on the other end of that spectrum, maybe there&#8217;s a bigger organizational issue almost where the product, or brand even, does not have a distinctive voice, there&#8217;s no documented set of brand guidelines for voice and tone, and maybe using that as an opportunity to contribute as a writer and produce an artifact and object that is super useful and helpful, and it can help put guard rails around design decisions for the future.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, it does vary from project to project, but ultimately it just goes back to trying to solve problems by using words, whatever those problems are.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I would imagine the stuff that you&#8217;re writing, it&#8217;s a lot of different stuff. It&#8217;s copy in terms of &#8230; I mean, I don&#8217;t know. It would depend on what the type of project is, but I would say like actual paragraphs of copy or you may be doing microcopy like alerts or statuses or things like that. Is that how it generally breaks down with the type of writing that you do on a project?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s a pretty big portion of it. I think there are other opportunities as well where we can get in a little bit further upstream and, like I mentioned, be able to define the voice and tone for a brand or product and have that be a little bit more of a high-level output.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
But yeah, a lot of the time it is executions like that where it&#8217;s, here&#8217;s a moment where a user might be frustrated, a pain point. Can we insert a little bit of microcopy or a toast or notification to sort of lift their spirits and usher them in the right direction? And what is the expression of that verbally that feels right for their brand and also doesn&#8217;t take up too much time? That is in a lot of instances copy, executions like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a gig that I worked at recently where I was doing some content strategy work. I was in a meeting &#8230; I forget who it was; I wasn&#8217;t at this gig very long. But I was in a meeting and I remember one of the designers &#8230; I don&#8217;t know. They just went off talking about how much they hated writing. It was because they had &#8230; I think they had started to create some copy and people were giving feedback on the copy. She just burst into this tantrum, like, &#8220;I just hate writing. Writing is not my thing. I hate writing. We really need to have someone else to do the writing so I don&#8217;t have to think about it. I&#8217;m not a writer, I&#8217;m a designer. I&#8217;m here to design. Why am I writing?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Whoa,&#8221; especially because I was the content strategist for that particular project that she was writing about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s interesting how &#8230; I mean, I don&#8217;t know if this is a sentiment shared by a lot of designers, but I would imagine being a design writer or being a writer on a design team like that. Those, I guess, help in terms of not giving the more visual designers or maybe the more front-end people stuff they have to worry about when it comes to, &#8220;Oh, does this sound right?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. No, totally. I mean, although I am a writer, there is a part of me that hates writing too. You know it is work, it is a craft. You know it is something you have to try hard to get better at. But also, a lot of the time, I hate trying to design too because I think &#8230; Maybe share somewhat of a similar experience to this designer you mentioned where it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re trying to express yourself or get something out that fulfills a purpose or solves a problem, but you just don&#8217;t necessarily have the tools or just doesn&#8217;t feel right. Like, when I&#8217;m trying to put frames together and move copy around in Figma and I&#8217;m just not learning the tool. I&#8217;m like, is this deep learning curve? That&#8217;s frustrating.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, definitely, I feel that sometimes too. But I think part of the beauty of, like you mentioned, this sort of shift in the makeup of design teams to include more writers is that recognition of this is balancing the expression a little bit more and making the product feel a little bit more whole and fully considered.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I think about some of my earlier internships as advertising copywriter. I will describe it as those more traditional art director copywriter duos where there is a person who thinks and communicates and expresses themselves visually, that has a dedicated partner who is someone who thinks and communicates and expresses themselves with words, and being the dynamic that hopefully produces more balanced, better work at the end of the day because people, again, approach creativity differently.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, yeah, I think writing is a lot more, maybe debatably, a more democratic kind of expression. I feel like although a lot of people will say, &#8220;I&#8217;m not a writer,&#8221; everyone writes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Well, not everybody, but most people in professional context have to write to some capacity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, you got to write an email.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly, right? Or Slack message. So, when it comes to putting words in a product that hopefully millions of people are going to use and it&#8217;d be helpful or functional for them, there&#8217;s a lot of pressure on those words to be right; let alone, presenting those words in front of a slew of clients and stakeholders.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, yeah, it can be frustrating in a lot of instances, but I do think having writers on the team, again, just balances that out and gives someone the opportunity to own that part of a project as well and also help shape the design process too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You know, it almost sounds like writing is a form of design.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Who would&#8217;ve thunk? Yeah. Yeah, I think of &#8230; I can&#8217;t remember the name of the researcher but there was an experiment where people would see either rounded shapes or more angular shapes and be asked by the research team, &#8220;Would you describe this shape as more of a kiki or a bouba?&#8221; More often than not, people would name the angular shape a kiki and the rounded shape a bouba because I think there is some inherent connection between processing things visually and processing things verbally that we all just begin to understand in a very similar way.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So I do think, to bring it back to your earlier point, that they&#8217;re just two different kinds of expressions, two different kinds of design at the end of the day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you think people misunderstand when it comes to what you do, being a writer in a design process? Is there other things that people just don&#8217;t get?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I think one of the things that I&#8217;ve had some conversations around in the past just to sort of &#8230; I think setting people straight feels like a little bit too intense of a way to describe it but it is a lot more, sometimes it can be, hopefully, than, although I did use this phrase earlier, making the word sound good, that&#8217;s part of what we do, yes, as writers on design teams. But to the spirit of thinking of writing as a kind of design, it really is, in a more holistic way, shaping a project or a piece of design through writing in a way that is bigger than just, does this sentence fit on a CTA button and looked good? Does the type laid out on this headline for your welcome email looked too much?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I think there&#8217;s a lot of moments where &#8230; I&#8217;ve experienced several moments where the design feels like it&#8217;s already set in place and they just want a writer to come in and line edit the copy. But we can really bring, I think, a lot more to a project than that by being brought on at an earlier phase. So, yeah, I think that&#8217;s one of the bigger misconceptions.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I see writing as being super important because good writing engages all your senses. Of course, you read something, you hear it. In a way it also kind of, I don&#8217;t know if I might be stretching this in terms of taste, but you know when you&#8217;ve read something that is difficult to read or it sounds cumbersome or something like that. It just doesn&#8217;t sound right or feel right in your mouth, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But then, even good words that you use can trigger certain memories. Good words can trigger a scent memory, it can trigger a taste memory, it could trigger a touch memory or anything like that. I mean, it&#8217;s really important because there&#8217;s so many words that you can use, there&#8217;s of course slang and jargon. That factors into depending on what kind of project that you have. Writing is just such a really important part of the design process. I&#8217;m glad to see that design teams are really starting to embrace that more and keep writers in the design fold because it is a really powerful part of what it is that we do.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah, totally. And I think, to your point, it&#8217;s also just shaping and communicating the personality of a product or a brand. Like, if you got a welcome email from a new retailer that you just signed up for their newsletter, the difference between, &#8220;Yo, what&#8217;s up, Maurice?&#8221; or &#8220;Hello, welcome to,&#8221; so and so &#8220;Maurice,&#8221; feels very distinct, and that&#8217;s a writing decision to make at the outset.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, in every moment, in every screen where there are words, that is an opportunity, potentially, to communicate something about the product that a user is using. Or, I think more functionally, with more utility, what they can get from it and how to do that. So, yeah, I think writing is really important in that process and in a lot of ways.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I know we&#8217;ve gotten to know a bit about your work and what you do, but I&#8217;m curious to just learn more about your origin story, essentially. You say that you are in New York right now. Are you originally from there?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
No, I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;ve been in New York for maybe eight years or so, but I&#8217;m originally from Maryland.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I grew up in the suburbs outside of DC. Actually, I went to high school at the same high school as one of your former guest, Ari Melenciano.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. We went to school in Maryland together. There, I was really into STEM. I was really interested in physics and engineering. I interned at NASA my junior year. I was at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
That was really fun. But that same year, I had a really awesome writing teacher and writing class. I just, all of a sudden, was really interested in writing as this structural craft. She broke down literally the formula, almost, of how to write a good essay. I didn&#8217;t know that writing could be so structural and formulaic in a way that I was already thinking about math and science and engineering and physics. I was like, &#8220;Oh, now I&#8217;m really interested in writing. Let&#8217;s pivot super hard.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, coming out of high school, I went to school in Baltimore, Maryland, at UMBC. I had some personal life events happen that, in addition to the burgeoning interest in writing, really made me curious about why people behave, act the way they do; why they think what they think. So, I studied psychology and sociology. I did a double major, but I minored in writing and philosophy.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
While I was learning about behavior en masse, I was also doing all these extracurriculars. I was tutoring at the writing center on campus. We had a lit mag called the Bartleby, I was the fiction editor of. I was writing for this online magazine that was about fashion and music. It was like streetwear culture. So, always sort of complementing, or at least I thought, my academics into more research-oriented studies with this extracurricular creative thing on the side.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Towards the end of undergrad, I was like, &#8220;Okay, I want to be in or around advertising in some capacity.&#8221; Maybe I&#8217;m a strategist, maybe I&#8217;m a copywriter. I&#8217;m not quite sure yet, but still really interested in why people think what they think and do what they do, like in groups.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I found this really interesting grad program at NYU in social and consumer psychology, and that&#8217;s what brought me to New York. So, it was really research centric. We did psychology of branding, cognitive behavioral research, just very scientific. Through a lot of those classes my teachers would tell me, it seems like you really are most excited for the essays and those assignments versus the practice research.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, I did a couple internships, consulting and copywriting, just to start dabbling, I think, and trying to make it more professionally as a writer, so to speak. I interned at this digital first political strategy consultancy as a consultant one summer, and then the following summer switched gears to this full service creative digital agency as a copywriter. That was when things started to pick up.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I was working on campaigns, digital campaigns and commercials. We&#8217;re doing a lot of scripts. It was just fun. I remember we did an ad for a quick service food chain where I, I don&#8217;t know, for whatever reason got super inspired and wrote almost like a rap song for their summer promo. Basically, the lyrics were like how to sign up for this promo and get a whole bunch of free burritos. It was just kind of quirky and funny and cool. I had a really good time doing it, and that&#8217;s what kind of let me know, like, okay, this is what I want to be doing, writing with a group of creative people and trying to put a visual expression around it or with it.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
After that internship, I was able to find a job on WeWork&#8217;s brand team. I was the second copywriter they hired. That was a really great experience because WeWork was just an already rapidly growing company with a whole bunch of different kinds of creatives. There were architectural designers, interior designers, product designers, illustrators. Everybody just making stuff to make these spaces and make the spaces really engaging and fun and cool to be in, so I just ran with that for a while. But then, there&#8217;s pretty big org shifts at the company and I started to feel I don&#8217;t really fit in as much as I would have liked to and wasn&#8217;t really getting as fulfilled by the work as I would have liked.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I found an article online about this burgeoning discipline called verbal design at an agency called RGA and send a cold note to the head of verbal design there. We got to talk and I was really interested in this more strategic high-level approach to writing where, instead of writing the tagline or the script for the commercial, it&#8217;s we&#8217;re going to name the brand. We&#8217;re going to think very strategically about what this new sub brand or new product should be called and why, and build a visual brand around that. Or, we&#8217;re going to put together 50 pages of voice and tone guidelines with a really clear articulation of what you should always be trying to do when you&#8217;re writing for this brand, how to do that. Some voice principles, things you can incorporate into your writing to live up to that. I was just really interested in that approach to writing, that kind of writing. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
And then, after that, I want to start working on more digital things. I want to start making websites and apps and chat bots. That&#8217;s what brought me to Work &amp; Co. It feels like it&#8217;s been kind of a windy road and lots of different kinds of writing along the way, but I do, in some way, use all of my past experiences in the work that I do now, so it feels all worth it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. I mean, when you summed it all up, we can wrap this interview up. No, I&#8217;m kidding.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
All right, see you later. This has been great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s go back because you covered a lot of ground there. We&#8217;re going to go back a little bit here.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like college was kind of where you first got the sense that you sort of wanted to be a writer for a living. It was interesting how you mentioned that you first were on the STEM track and then you got introduced to this writing teacher, and that showed you how writing can be very structural and that sort of way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s very interesting because I also was on the &#8230; Well, I mean I was on the STEM track. My degree is in math but I&#8217;ve been writing, oh my god, since a little kid, maybe since four or five, all the way up to now at my big age. I wrote all through middle school, all through high school, all through college, et cetera and people always thought it was weird. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, how was it that you&#8217;re studying math but then you&#8217;re also a writer. How does that make any sense?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What I would tell people is that structuring a mathematical proof is very similar to structuring an essay. It&#8217;s also very similar to structuring a proposal for design services or web services. The certain aspects might be called different things, like what may be called, I don&#8217;t know, the brief inside of a proposal is the same thing as kind of setting up all of your assumptions and corollaries and such for a proof. It&#8217;s very much kind of the same thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting that you really sort of picked up on that structural building of writing. Because I think, probably when most folks think of writing, they think Shakespeare or, you know. They think flower prose or creative writing. I think even that has some elements of structure into it, but it sounds like you were able to really make that distinction between the structure of making something sound good and how that is very similar to a, I don&#8217;t know, maybe like an algorithm or something to that effect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I also interned in NASA. Not in high school like you-</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; genius. I interned in college. I worked at Ames Research Center for a summer, and I worked at-</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; Marshall Space Flight Center down in Huntsville.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Oh, wow. I feel like the more we talk, the more we realize we have so much in common.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
That&#8217;s so funny. No, yeah, totally. I just felt like there was this lightbulb moment where I hadn&#8217;t been thinking of writing at all a structured kind of expression. I think that I&#8217;m hooked on phonics. You know, like in elementary school or pre K even, I don&#8217;t remember how old I was, just learn how to read and write. The basics, the grammar of it all. But even with those simple nuts and bolts, I hadn&#8217;t taken the next step of thinking about how to write at length with form and structure and some sort of, I don&#8217;t know, cohesive, sort of bodily shape to it or behind it even.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, yeah, when I realized that most, if not all, good pieces of writing follow similar tropes and patterns given that genre, whether it&#8217;s a novel or the different kinds of expressions of poems or even the product work that I do now, it&#8217;s like there are best practices, I would say, to use, I guess, a little bit of professional jargon. There are approaches that work. So, yeah, that was just a really big light bulb moment for me. And now, I&#8217;m just so interested in learning more of them and using them to make good work with writing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now you mentioned also you interned at these agencies. You interned at, I think the first agency you&#8217;re referring to was [inaudible 00:35:48] and then after that you were at KARATs, I believe?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, KARAT Creative.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At KARAT Creative, but you also had the shift from working in these agencies to working in house, particularly once you worked at WeWork. And I would probably say, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know, I guess working at Work &amp; Co. was kind of &#8230;&#8221; Do you consider that more agency or more in-house?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I think, I mean, we are a product design and development agency, so I think of it as an agency although it&#8217;s very different than, at least, my other agency experiences-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
&#8230; have been.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there a big difference for you being a writer in an agency environment versus in an in-house environment?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
From my experience, yes. The biggest has been in an agency setting, being able, and encouraged to touch a much wider variety of types of businesses, types of projects. I just feel like, especially at this stage in my career, I just want to soak up as much information and experience as possible, and that&#8217;s why I feel more interested in working at an agency right now.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve worked on projects in industries like genomics or healthcare or retail or the nonprofit space. There&#8217;s such an array of exciting opportunities when you&#8217;re working at an agency. Versus when you&#8217;re in-house, you&#8217;re really dedicated to that one brand, that one set of products, that one mission. I mean, you really get to focus in, in a very specific way especially as a writer. Very deeply understand and appreciate the voice and tone behind the brand of the company that you&#8217;re working with and also mold it and shape and evolve it in a unique way too.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
But I think the biggest distinction, at least that I&#8217;ve experienced, has been choosing between breadth and depth. In my time at WeWork, I think I was there for almost two years, like I mentioned, the org shifted. The focus of the brand shifted more from small businesses and entrepreneurs to midsize businesses, and enterprise clients even.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
That was a big shift, I think, in the kinds of work that we were doing, the ways that we were articulating ourselves and the marketing materials and advertising and even the core product, the website and the coworking spaces themselves. To watch that happen from within was a really unique experience, but I also just wanted to change it up a little bit too, and I think you get that change of pace, which is great, at an agency.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, with Revision Path being the show that it is and the environment, we talk to black designers and developers and creatives and such. And so, I may never implicitly ask them what&#8217;s it like being a black blank or something like that in terms of what they do, but I&#8217;m curious for you since you are the first writer on the show. Being black in the industry, what have your experiences been like as you&#8217;ve furthered on in your career?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I do feel blessed and highly favored. I think I&#8217;m very lucky to have a lot of positive experiences, but it certainly hasn&#8217;t been wholly positive either. I think part of what I&#8217;ve felt in various roles and moments throughout my career is this, like, Reese is here to make the word sound cool, like give it a little bit of flavor. Almost as kind of like the energy I&#8217;ve gotten in some context. Sometimes, and this is just me sort of trying to be honest about my own perceptions of those moments, sometimes that, I think, might be me interpreting that coming from people or just generally what they&#8217;re giving me, or sometimes even what the project needs. So, I think there&#8217;s that layer of like, &#8220;Are you just asking me to do this because I&#8217;m a black writer or is this really what needs to happen?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do people come to you expecting you to slang something up a bit or like, you know-</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; &#8220;Can you blacken this up a little bit?&#8221; Something like that?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. People might say, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t have the cultural permission to do this, so can you do this for me?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. [inaudible 00:40:08] on it.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Right. Exactly, [inaudible 00:40:10]. That has been something I felt at moments throughout my career. But I also think too, though, even other more senior black writers or other black professionals even in the design industry I&#8217;ve seen who, I think in some instances, very clearly have demonstrated a level of performance and excellence that is ridiculous. It&#8217;s like they&#8217;re just so good at what they do, they&#8217;re sort of being passed over for promotions or raises or even more junior people are making more money than them sometimes.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I do think that there is a sort of, maybe not an under appreciation of black talent everywhere, but it&#8217;s definitely an issue that I&#8217;ve felt and also talked, I think, very freely and openly frequently about with some of my friends who also work in the industry. But even with that in mind, I think, especially after last year, it feels almost to be like a turning point or a reckoning moment where the powers that be are at least more aware of, if not eager, to create a healthier culture and dynamic for all kinds of black professionals. That is something I&#8217;m really excited for and glad to be living through, anyway.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Now, say we&#8217;ve got someone that&#8217;s listening to this and they want to follow what you do or they want to maybe become a writer in the design industry. Now, this might be a lofty question but I&#8217;m curious, what advice would you tell them? Are there any particular resources or anything they should check out? Anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I&#8217;d say, I guess sort of related to some of the points we chatted about earlier. Like, there&#8217;s so many different kinds of writing and ways to be a writer in design and technology and make a living. I know people who just do naming, I know people who are really interested and focused on brand copywriting. They just want to do voice and tone guidelines or just want to do commercials, or just want to work in product. There are so many ways that writing becomes a part of the creative or design process.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, I think having as clear a vision of what sort of subdivision of writing you&#8217;re most interested in and building a portfolio around that or making connections with people who do that kind of work, seeing the kinds of projects that they work on and are excited by so you just get a better sense of what really jazz you up. Because I think that&#8217;s really like, the secret sauce is to, as often as possible, just do the things that get you the most excited even if that changes from month to month, quarter to quarter, year to year. Just follow.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
It&#8217;s going to be clich√©, follow your passions. But I think that ultimately is what encourages anyone to show up more fully to a professional conversation. So, yeah, just figuring out what that looks like for you I think is the best advice I could give. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You said there are some people that just do naming and these are design writers, or there are some people that just do voice and tone work as it relates to style guides and thing like that. Okay, I&#8217;m curious for myself. I just wanted to know how do those work? I mean, I feel like that&#8217;s such a specific &#8230; I almost feel like that&#8217;s hyper specific to be a writer and only be able to focus on those small things like voice and tone or naming as opposed to what you have been doing with microcopy and things of that nature.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I think when you&#8217;re that specialized, especially if you&#8217;re freelancing, you can command a little bit more compensation for the value that you would bring. There are examples, great examples of voice and tone guidelines. I think Adobe has a great one online I think MailChimp has online as well. There are examples online of great pieces of work like that, articles.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a brand blog. I think it&#8217;s like how to build a brand that has a series of great articles about different kinds of names, different approaches to naming, just like having your toolkit and your arsenal. But, yeah, there are ways to figure it out in a way. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily work or look the same for everybody, but just trying it out and figuring out what your own process could look like and how you might approach making something like that, if you&#8217;re interested in it, is an interesting way to go about it too. Because I think in a lot of those moments you get to make the rules, really.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
It&#8217;s like you get to brief yourself sometimes because a team typically who would be asking for help with naming might not know how that process really works. So, you get to leave the conversation. Although they&#8217;ll obviously be giving you feedback, you can sort of steer them in the way that you want to go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s interesting.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. You and I are going to talk more about that after this interview because that really-</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
All right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; that extremely piqued my interest right now, so we may have to go more into that. Given where you are in your career, who were some of the mentors and people that have really helped you out along the way?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
You know, I think of all my old managers, really. When I was at WeWork [inaudible 00:45:40] I was the second copywriter that was hired to the brand team, but the first had come from Etsy prior.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
She kind of took me under her wing, showed me so much about product writing in that moment too because we&#8217;re building new micro sites and web activations for the company at the time. But I think really just taught me not only how to show up as a writer and collaborate with different kinds of designers, but how to navigate a company of that size, like a professional setting in a way that was really authentic and special. So, I appreciate that.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah, even moving on throughout my career. A number of great thoughtful managers and team leaders even, that I think overall did a great job of being themselves in a way and having their own creative process. Inviting people to become a part of that and sharing what they knew to work for getting work approved or producing good work, like different prompts or writing techniques to generate ideas even. All of those experiences have just been helpful for me in some capacity throughout my career.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, yeah, literally everybody. Literally everybody. And, again, I say blessed and highly favored, because literally everybody I&#8217;ve worked with has helped me in some way. It&#8217;s just been so great to have that experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is this where you saw your career going when you first started out as a writer? Or rather, when you first got into writing, this teacher introduced you to the mechanics of it, is this where you thought your career would end up?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Not at all. I&#8217;ve veered off course. I&#8217;m somewhere in the middle of the woods and just eaten berries, I guess. I don&#8217;t know. Weird analogy.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
But, no. When I first had that teacher in high school who broke down how to write a good essay for me, I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go to New York and be a music journalist. I&#8217;m going to be on the tour bus with backstage writing down all these really hot takes and his experiences into a really interesting story for The FADER or SPIN Magazine.&#8221; That was the kind of approach that I had.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
But the more, I think, different kinds of writing that I started reading and the more that I started to see writing appear in advertising, or at least think more deeply about the writing that appears in advertising and marketing and on the apps that I was using, in the websites I was reading, I was like, &#8220;Oh, writing words are everywhere,&#8221; so I have so much jurisdiction. It&#8217;s such a wider playground, a magazine or a book.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
That was the turning point for me where I was just like, &#8220;Okay, if I&#8217;m interested in this medium and there are words there, let&#8217;s try and figure out how to be a part of that.&#8221; That was the journey for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there any advice about writing or about your career that is really stuck with you over the years?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. Read your work out loud is a big one, I think. It&#8217;s a lot easier for things to sound good in your head or look good on paper, but when you read it aloud in your voice, you might hear things that you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I think another one is to not be precious or not be a perfectionist. Again, writing is such a democratic, even, type of expression that I feel like when you&#8217;re a designer, you&#8217;re trying to solve a problem, produce the &#8220;right answer.&#8221; But a lot of times there is way more than one right answer, so be really open to other ideas and suggestions from the people that you&#8217;re collaborating with. Just don&#8217;t be precious about your work and your words because it could be better and it could be different. A lot of the time it&#8217;s better, even in a collaborative setting, to invite people into that process and let their voices be heard in a medium that they&#8217;re trying to express themselves in writing as well.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
So, yeah, don&#8217;t be precious and read your work. Yeah, I think those are the top two pieces of advice I would give.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything that you&#8217;d like to do in your career yet that you haven&#8217;t done?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I have been thinking a lot more recently about submitting more creative writing to periodicals, lit mags, journals. I think that&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve kind of gotten away from. When I was in undergrad I was writing for this online magazine. I&#8217;m the fiction editor of the lit mag at school, so a lot of the writing that I do now is more solution oriented, just like making a project or product as whatever it needs to be as it can be. But I do want to get more into, or more back into, I should say to just more creative writing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Man, we just had a design anthology called Recognize that we started back in 2019, where basically I would give a theme and then people can write essays, basically design essays or design-focused essays around that particular theme.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
For example, this year&#8217;s theme was reboot. People would write essays to that, 3000 words or less. We publish them, we pay them. We stopped doing it this year because, honestly, there was a woeful lack of interest among designers.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the stick [inaudible 00:51:18], I feel like. At least my experience has been, and I think it&#8217;s why I&#8217;m trying to get the pendulum to swing back the other way is thinking of writing so much so as like a tool to solve a problem. It&#8217;s kind of hard to switch gears back into I&#8217;m just going to write more creatively, write in response to this prompt, write to express an idea that I just had. So yeah, I feel that pain. But, yeah, it&#8217;s a muscle that I haven&#8217;t used in a while and want to use more of. I would imagine, a lot of other design writers might feel the same too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, we did it for three years. We had &#8230; And honestly, the pandemic also kind of killed it. I don&#8217;t want to make it seem like it was totally just lack of interest from people. But once the pandemic happened, people were really more focused on surviving, which is fair. Like, please try to live. Don&#8217;t worry about trying to get 3,000 words [inaudible 00:52:13]. Don&#8217;t worry about that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I would say even to this end, probably because things are still &#8230; I don&#8217;t know, information is still changing every day around this, it&#8217;s just not something that folks are super interested in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I initially wanted to do the anthology because back in 2018, I had won the Steven Heller Prize for Cultural Commentary from AIGA. It&#8217;s usually awarded to writers, and I received it as a podcaster. But it got me to thinking about just the power of writing as a designer because it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve always kind of proselytized to designers for years. I&#8217;m like, it makes your proposals better, it makes your case studies better, et cetera.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But the more that I started doing this podcast, and especially once I started really getting recognized for it, which is why we call the anthology Recognize, is that black designers writing ensures that we are in the design history too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s very easy to go into a bookstore, to go on Amazon or something and you can go to the design section. There&#8217;s a lot of design books and very few are by people of color, let alone black people. It&#8217;s not to say that the writing that black designer should do should always be in a novel or in book form, but it could be writing on medium, it could be something where people can see your thoughts long form and get a sense of how you think and what&#8217;s your process is and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to see that because we&#8217;re the next generation, I feel, of design writers out there, and we need to cultivate that. There needs to be a way to let people know that, hey, the only writing you do doesn&#8217;t have to be an email. You can also write about a project, or a thought process or things like that. I&#8217;ve been fortunate to have a few designers on here who are pretty good writers. I don&#8217;t know if they would really consider continually doing the writing, but &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Most recently I had Jeffrey Henderson on, who is a footwear designer in New York, and he owns an agency called AndThem. He&#8217;s been writing on medium probably for a few years now. Just such great writing. I would read an entire book of Jeffrey&#8217;s writing because it&#8217;s about projects, it&#8217;s about his thought process. He weaves his own personal story into coming from Cleveland and everything. It&#8217;s just so good, and it&#8217;s not writing that you see from black designers, but it is ostensibly design writing.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s so important. I mean, like I said earlier, so much of great work comes from passion and so much of writing becomes better when it&#8217;s grounded in intention.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Those things overlap, right? It&#8217;s like if you have an idea that you just feel so jazzed up about, getting that out through writing is what, in my opinion, produces better writing.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I mean, to your credit with having that won award, for me to think about writing as it extends from a novel or a poem to the writing in an ad or in a product even. I think of even podcasting as an auditory, a verbal expression, a kind of writing too. So, I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s too far off base. Maybe a departure from the people who&#8217;ve won the award previously, but it&#8217;s definitely all connected. It&#8217;s like that kiki and that bouba, to go back to what it&#8217;s like. These kinds of expression are all intertwined at the end of the day. So, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want your legacy to be?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Oh, wow. Hopefully, I think &#8230; I&#8217;ll have to say, doing what I&#8217;m doing now but on a bigger level, continuing to work on projects that I&#8217;m passionate about.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I think one of the things I&#8217;ve been able to do more recently through Work &amp; Co. actually is begin to work with a number of clients who are in the nonprofit space. We have the Work &amp; Co. Fund, which is this allotment of a million dollars&#8217; worth of work essentially invested in nonprofits that advance the Black community. It&#8217;s really the agency working to leverage this ability, that the agency has to build and design and develop and ship these digital products to enact positive social change.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Those are the projects that I&#8217;ve worked on more recently that feel the most fulfilling and rewarding to me. I&#8217;m trying to think more about how I can do more stuff like that not only through Work &amp; Co. but extracurricularly as well. I think in five years, hopefully, I&#8217;ll have more of my day-to-day time devoted to projects that fall in line with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
I&#8217;m on LinkedIn. Just Reese Fuller. It&#8217;s Reese, like the peanut butter filled chocolate cups; Fuller, F-U-L-L-E-R. I&#8217;m also on Instagram, which is @reesefuller with an underscore at the end, but I don&#8217;t really post all that much there. But, yeah, I try to keep a pretty quaint, minimal digital presence, but I am very responsive. If you shoot me a message on LinkedIn or Instagram, I&#8217;ll definitely hit you back.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
A writer that&#8217;s not on Twitter? Wow.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
Yeah. I have Twitter back in the day. We could talk about Twitter. I had a Twitter back in the day. I still will lurk on Twitter every so often. I still get my [inaudible 00:58:01] my info but, yeah, just trying to be a little bit more intentional and conscious, minimalize the web presence a little bit. I think only so much output to give and trying to focus it in different places.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good strategy to have, yeah. Wow, Reese Fuller, thank you so much for coming on the show, for being Revision Path&#8217;s first writer on the show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think a lot of what you said about your process and how you work on projects at Work &amp; Co. I think is super important for designers and even developers and other creatives that are listening to hear, to kind of get a sense of what it&#8217;s like to be on &#8230; I almost want to say, the other side of the process. You know, there&#8217;s left brain, right brain, and writing seems to be different from maybe more visual type of work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s also good to note that it&#8217;s clear that you&#8217;ve put a lot of thought into the work that you&#8217;re doing. I really get the sense you have a strong work ethic, and even just a strong ethical core as it relates to the type of work that you do. I&#8217;m glad that you&#8217;re able to just share that with us so other people who may be interested in becoming writers can do that as well. So, thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Reese Fuller:</b><br>
No, thank you for having me, Maurice. You know, I&#8217;ve listened to this podcast for so long when I was getting ready and interested in getting into the industry. I listen to you and your guests chat about their experience. It taught me so much as well. So, yeah, it feels amazing to have that all come full circle and hopefully give some of that back to folks today. So, yeah, thank you for having me on. It&#8217;s really been an honor, and I&#8217;ve enjoyed it.</p>

<p>When I first heard about Jerome Harris&#8217; exhibit¬†<a href="https://www.instagram.com/asnotfor/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">&#8220;As, Not For: Dethroning Our Absolutes,&#8221;</a>¬†I knew I had to interview him for the podcast. I was thrilled to hear him speak at this year&#8217;s Black in Design Conference back in October, and this conversation follows directly after that event.</p>
<p>Jerome does it all ‚Äî he&#8217;s a graphic designer, an educator, a writer, a curator, a DJ, and even a choreographer! We touched on all those aspects in this interview, starting off with talking about his current work at¬†<a href="https://www.housingworks.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Housing Works</a>. From there, we discussed the trajectory of Black graphic design, and how that guided him through his studies at Temple and Yale and inspired his exhibit. Jerome also shares some of his current influences, and we step into the future a bit and look at what Jerome would want to work on in 2025.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for Jerome ‚Äî his perspective and candor are a refreshing antidote to current design discourse, and I think we&#8217;ll see a lot more from him soon!</p>

<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Okay. My name is Jerome Harris. I&#8217;m originally from New Haven, Connecticut. Studied advertising at Temple University and I got my MFA from Yale University in graphic design. For the last I&#8217;ve been working at MICA, Maryland Institute College of Art as a teaching fellow. So it&#8217;s full time faculty with one course taken off of the course load for research purposes. Now I&#8217;m the design director of Housing Works in New York City and I&#8217;m also a choreographer sometimes. I also DJ sometimes and I like to cook. Oh yeah. And I&#8217;m a big gamer.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Sounds like you&#8217;re juggling a lot over there.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I mean some things take more priorities than others.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Let&#8217;s talk about what you&#8217;re doing over at at Housing Works as the design director. What is Housing Works first of all? Then walk me through what you do there. What&#8217;s a regular day like there?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Cool. So Housing Works was originally the housing arm of the ACT UP activists collective from the late &#8217;80s, early &#8217;90s who were advocating for the rights of people with HIV and AIDS during the AIDS epidemic. So Housing Works was just the group of people who were trying to get people with HIV AIDS into homes so that they could &#8230; Because they believed that if they had a place to stay they would get better faster as opposed to being on the street or what have you. So that group of people from from this activist group grew into this huge NIO nonprofit organization. We have four health clinics around the city of New York, and then we&#8217;re self-sustained by 12, now 13 thrift stores. 14 actually, we just opened a new one. 14 thrift stores around the city. And then we have a bookstore cafe. And in addition to that, we do a four to five huge fundraising campaigns every year.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: We moved beyond the scope of just HIV AIDS. We help homeless people, people who need to reintegrate into society after they get released from jail, drug rehabilitation, youth services for LGBTQ youth and of course housing, Housing Works. We have, I think, 600 plus units. That might be incorrect, but we have a housing around the city taking care of people with different illnesses, getting them care.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Wow, that sounds like a lot of stuff that you all are doing there. It sounds really impactful.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Yep. So a lot of work. It&#8217;s all hands on deck. We have a huge team. We have two administrative offices, one in Soho in New York and one downtown Brooklyn where where I work and everybody&#8217;s there. Everyone&#8217;s down to do the work. It&#8217;s a very cool work environment. I mean given the population we work with you have to be empathetic and down for the cause. It&#8217;s funny cause a part of the job is were required to take part in civil disobedience as a part of the job. I feel like in your performance review they asked how many protests have you been to this year?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Which is cool. I&#8217;ve only been to one so far.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: You&#8217;re slacking. You&#8217;ve got to go to more.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: It&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Get out on them streets.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: It&#8217;s only been three months.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Okay. Okay. Okay. All right.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: However, yeah, I like that. It&#8217;s awesome. It&#8217;s just the values and everybody there, we&#8217;re all working on the same team. No egos. Everybody is just getting work done.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: And okay, so you also asked about a day at work. Now designing is, I&#8217;m literally like three designers right now. We&#8217;re also hiring, so when this airs, if we haven&#8217;t hired anybody, we&#8217;re looking for a designer. I do a variety of things. I work for the thrift shops in the bookstore, so I do all of the marketing for that. So that can be just weekly events, sales signage, in store signage for the store. We do cut vinyl posters. I do motion as for social media, this is across the board, everything for the thrift shops. Same thing with the bookstore, just any of their needs.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: And then on the other end, I do designs for fundraising campaigns. So that usually means building out an identity in the system for the designer that we&#8217;re going to hire and then our production designer to then build our assets for print, for screen, for social media and everything else in between. Like we just had a protest on October 8th in Washington DC for LGBTQ rights in the workplace. So I got to make protest signs and so usually protest signs are these scrappy things that people make them their own, but it&#8217;s nicely designed protest signs. It&#8217;s really nice to see. A whole coach bus of Housing Works employees went down to the Hill and protested and it&#8217;s just awesome. You know? It&#8217;s just a cool thing to feel that you&#8217;re a part of that, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. How did you first hear about them?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Well, I knew about the thrift stores. When I tell people about Housing Works, they&#8217;re usually like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I go to the thrift store.&#8221; I did know the history, which I liked, but I was contacted by the creative director because they had kind of contracting designers and hadn&#8217;t had anybody, a design director full time on the team for awhile. So she reached out to me because of my work, the exhibition, As, Not For, and thought that that would be a good fit for the workplace. And this was like back in January and I was like, I don&#8217;t know. I might stay at MICA. I don&#8217;t know. Academia was proving, after my second year there, was proving to be a little draining for reasons I don&#8217;t know if I want to talk about. I just wanted to move into something that was still fulfilling personally, but I still wanted to give back and I wanted the work to be fulfilling. So I talked to the creative directors. Said I&#8217;ll give it a shot. And I interviewed, went through a second round of interview, they gave me a design test and then they pulled me on in June.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Okay. And so I know you&#8217;ve only been there, like you said, for just a few months now. What do you want to accomplish going into 2020? What do you see Housing Works becoming in the next year?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: There&#8217;s multiple goals because it&#8217;s such a scrappy &#8230; I keep using that word, but everything moves pretty fast and everybody has to be all hands on deck. So I&#8217;m trying to get them to a place, particularly the thrift stores for example, to be in a competitive advantage design-wise with the retailers in the areas of the city that they&#8217;re in. They&#8217;re placed directly next to places like H&amp;M and J Crew and Uniqlo and stuff like this around the city. And these are stores with huge design teams and these corporations with beautiful design. And so I just try to, even though it&#8217;s just me and eventually one other person, just try to give them a visual competitive advantage. They already have a great perception amongst their regular shoppers, but just drawing in a new community through more contemporary design and more slick design that fits into the environment where they exist.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: And then the other thing is the fundraising campaign in the past, usually because they happen so fast, it&#8217;s so much work to do. In the past I&#8217;ve just been not completely well thought through, just let&#8217;s just get it done. So then I&#8217;m trying to really bring in more of the advocate voice into it and then also bringing more contemporary design sensibilities into the work. A little more thoughtful design into the work too. And that way, in addition to convincing people to give us money, make people feel good through the design, gain a better perception from the audience and the donor through the work.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Okay. Now, you mentioned a lot already about starting out a Temple, being at Yale, you mentioned your exhibit, all of which I want to go into of course, but I&#8217;m curious the story before all of that. So where did you grow up? I know you&#8217;re currently in Brooklyn right now, but where&#8217;d you grow up?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Yeah, I grew up in New Haven, Connecticut, actually. Literally, I lived the walking distance from Yale as a kid and that was a interesting place to be because I ended up being in a way a benefactor of Yale being really close as a kid. There was the African American Cultural Center on campus and they had free tutoring. So I think all through elementary school and middle school, so I think maybe starting in third grade through eighth grade, my parents couldn&#8217;t afford to send me to private school, but they did want me to have some help. Some advantage. They understood the public school system can be a hindrance in some ways, sometimes. And so my parents brought me to the African American Culture Center for free tutoring. I literally went there three days a week for that five years between third grade and eighth grade and just got tutored.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I mean it wasn&#8217;t I needed tutoring, but I think that they understood that we are in proximity to this place. Why not give our son the leg up, which shout out to my parents for that. And then how I got into design was in high school we had Photoshop in our computer lab and in 2001 &#8230; The first thing I designed, which is really funny, in 2001 Aaliyah died. That was in August and 9/11 happened. And so I was so moved.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I was like, what do I do? And I made an image. I probably wasn&#8217;t using Google. I was probably using like Alta Vista or something like that. I was searching for images of the twin towers and Aaliyah and I made this whole collage of all these pictures of Aaliyah and her choreographer Fatima Robinson and all these people. That was the first thing I ever made. And then after that, that sensibility to isolate figures, which I feel like I most likely got from Cash Money Records album artwork fed into an interest in college and undergraduate to design party flyers. Because after that I got better and better and was using illegal versions of the Adobe Creative Suite back in the day.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I think a lot of us were back then, so.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Yeah. No shame. No shame about it.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Nothin&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: It became a side hustle. I was a Photoshop guru at one point and I would just design these party flyers. But yeah, New Haven was a really interesting place to grow up because you have the whole disparity. You have the poorest of poor and the most rich and elite all in the same place in almost evenly spread in a way. You get these crossovers of these different moments and Yale students crossing over with locals. And that happens in any college town but in New Haven it&#8217;s a particularly special mix.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: So I went to Morehouse here in Atlanta and I remember the first year that I was there, this was &#8217;99 and I mean I&#8217;m from the sticks. I&#8217;m from the country. So it was already a bit of a culture shock coming into a big city, but not a huge one. Morehouse is one of those schools that has people from all over the world, from all different socioeconomic backgrounds and everything. And I remember my roommate at the time, apparently his mom told him that he needed to dress down if he was going to go out into the neighborhood because Morehouse is literally in the hood. It&#8217;s in the middle of not the best neighborhood in the city. It&#8217;s not terrible, but it&#8217;s the hood essentially.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I&#8217;m probably fucking that up. But anyway, I remember him saying his mom was like well they told me I need to dress down. Dress in less expensive clothing just to make sure when I go out that nobody&#8217;s going to rob me or anything. And I&#8217;m like that&#8217;s sounds dumb. But if you feel that&#8217;s what you have to do, go right ahead. So I know what that odd disparity looks like.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Now, It&#8217;s interesting enough because that area around Morehouse has cleaned up a lot. Mainly because the school just bought the land and tore the buildings down and stuff. But yeah, I know what that can look like in an urban setting.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Yeah, both of those things are really interesting to think about because I&#8217;m being reductive when I&#8217;m saying this. I&#8217;m just going to let everybody know I&#8217;m being self aware about what I&#8217;m saying. But there are a spectrum of black people and that was also, besides it being pretty racially diverse and socioeconomically diverse. I would have a group of black friends and some of them would come from money, come from more money, and their parents would be a little more like respectable. So they wouldn&#8217;t use the N-word and dressed a certain way. Some of my friends would not be allowed to go to somewhere like the all ages parties I would go to in high school or middle school. I totally understand that, know who that mom is. The mom of your roommate. But yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: So you were designing these flyers at Temple. What was your time like there when you were studying and everything?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Temple was interesting because I didn&#8217;t realize that I wanted to do graphic design. Even when I was making party flyers, I was like, oh, I&#8217;m a party flyer designer. You know what I mean? I didn&#8217;t realize completely what I was doing. So when it came time for me to choose a major, I was like, oh yeah, I&#8217;m going to major in advertising because I didn&#8217;t, you know what I mean? For me that was a logical choice. You&#8217;re asking a 19 or 20 year old what they want to do with the rest of their life. I was like, okay, I think I want to do this.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I think around my junior year or so I realized, oh, Temple has a whole art school. Tyler School of Art. Maybe I should try to go there instead. I got shut shut down because I wasn&#8217;t coming from a fine arts background. I didn&#8217;t know that ling so well. I emailed the chair photo images of my party flyers. I don&#8217;t remember her name, but she said, &#8220;This is not graphic design. You can&#8217;t take classes here.&#8221; I was like, whoa. Then I actually went through the advertising school. There&#8217;s all these roadblocks. The art school&#8217;s different than the main college. Dah, dah, dah.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I was a little bit disappointed. At that point I was self taught anyway, but I didn&#8217;t have any guidance. My parents didn&#8217;t know what graphic design was, you know what I mean? I didn&#8217;t have anybody to say, &#8220;This is what you&#8217;re doing.&#8221; I was just doing it. Temple was cool. I love Philadelphia. I would move back to Philly any day.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: So I&#8217;m curious about that, that remark, because I don&#8217;t know, for some reason that just rubbed me the wrong way about them telling you that those flyers that you were doing were not graphic design. As you look back at that time, do you agree with that sentiment or no?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I think, and this goes into my issue with the understanding that modernism is the whole graphic design. Because what I was doing was a trajectory and black graphic design of following in the footsteps of the artwork used for Master P and Cash Money Records and DJ Screw. Artwork made by Pen &amp; Pixel in Houston where they would isolate the figures, have all these affects and blingy texts and stuff. This still is a legitimate method of approaching graphic design. So these are the things that I was sending, but good design is modernist, right? It&#8217;s on a grid, it&#8217;s aligned, it has good proximity and space and asymmetry and it&#8217;s minimalist. Good design only requires a little bit to design. You know what I mean? These principles by the champions of the Bauhaus and Swiss, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. Like Euro centric design principles basically.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Yeah. Became just the entirety of when you say graphic design, that&#8217;s what it is, right? Only. As a 20 year old, I was like, well I&#8217;m making money doing this. This is real. This is legit. But I didn&#8217;t know how to say that. My feelings weren&#8217;t really that hurt because I did see that what they were making in the graphic design program and I was like, oh this looks like what I see in Time magazine or what I was looking at the time. This is how the ads look. When I watch TV commercials, this is how things are designed.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: It&#8217;s really interesting and in retrospect that person, and this is not uncommon, it&#8217;s just being a gatekeeper of what graphic design is and what it should be. And I think that&#8217;s a large part of what I&#8217;ve been writing about and lecturing about recently is about how just making people self aware that that&#8217;s not the only way to approach graphic design. There&#8217;s a bunch of ways to approach graphic design. It&#8217;s easy. Modernism gives an immediate legitimacy to any piece of work. If it looks like that, it&#8217;s immediately familiar to people and they&#8217;re like, this is good. And yeah. Anyway, I hope I answered your question.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. So, after Temple you went back to your roots in a way. You went to graduate school in New Haven at Yale. What was the design program like there once you were actually in that institution instead of around it as you were before?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Yeah, it was interesting from a social standpoint. I was at school, I went to class, but I would go home and do my homework and then go to my parents&#8217; house and have dinner. So it was a weird return back home because a lot of people who came to Yale were from other places as clearly as most people do in school. So their society was just their classmates. I was home. So I was like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll see y&#8217;all later. I&#8217;m going to eat this fried chicken. I&#8217;ll see y&#8217;all later.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: And then from a academic point of view, it was literally like the clouds broke and the light shined through because I had never thought of approaching design from a research standpoint. I&#8217;ve never had to think about concepts any deeper than, okay, I&#8217;m designing for a gay party, so I&#8217;m going to put a dude half naked on the front. And it&#8217;s a beach party so I&#8217;m going to put palm trees. You know what I mean? I never thought any deeper than that. So it was like I had professors who were really pushing me to be more conceptual and really push it and get really weird and then say, okay, have I gone too far? Is this still accessible? So thinking about the range of visual references that you can make and thinking about who&#8217;s looking at it and who can access that.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: And also methods of production. So like I had, for example, I had taught myself HTML and CSS prior to, but thinking about just not even using coding to make a website, but using coding just to make type a graphic form. You know what I mean? Just things like this that sound basic that you would learn in probably undergraduate art school were just new ideas to me and I was like, oh shoot, I like this. It was really fun for me and I had no understanding of how graphic design operated in the fine arts world. I used to go to museums and stuff and just look at this stuff but never thought about it in that way. So just learning the nuances and the subtle choices that designers make and the understanding of how to give people access people through images and texts was really interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Also how to expand my thinking. How to broaden the way that I think about designers. That was more the takeaway from me being at Yale because I literally knew nothing that they had to offer. Whereas a lot of my classmates had an understanding of fine arts and graphic design and conceptual thinking and the heroes of graphic design. My heroes, I didn&#8217;t even know who they were actually. I was just reading Vibe magazine and Ebony magazine. Looking at music artwork for Hot 97, which is a hip hop station in New York. Hot 97 mixed tapes and Cash Money Records. All these things, that for me.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: &#8230; cash, money, records, all these things. That for me it was graphic design in my black life as a youth.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I would say it&#8217;s still very much is still graphic design. When we look back at it I think that&#8217;s the case. It&#8217;s interesting though that it sounds like Yale was the nexus point where you realized that, what I&#8217;m doing actually is valid and I can apply and explore different things through the work as opposed to like you said before, using the work on its face.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Yes, exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Let&#8217;s talk about your exhibition. It&#8217;s titled &#8216;As, Not For: Dethroning Our Absolutes.&#8217; I heard about it last year. Someone sent me a link to it on AIGA&#8217;s Eye on Design. It was a whole article about it. Can you talk about the exhibit and where the notion came from to curate all this?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: It&#8217;s really funny. When I was at MICA, we were required to do a research project and I had two topics that I wanted to do and I was actually leaning away from doing black design because I was a little bit exhausted with the notion of being a mascot for the race in a way in graphic design. I was like I don&#8217;t know if I want to do this.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: And so my other topic, because I&#8217;m a gamer, I&#8217;m really interested in the maximal really saturated colors and compositions and if you look at a still of a video game and bring in that level of overwhelming-ness over into graphic design and communication standpoint. That was my initial idea and I was interested in fantasy worlds, but then I started going down both paths and researching both. I already had done a little research into Buddy Esquire. He designed hip hop party flyers during the rise of hip hop before it was even called hip hop. I think I just had the thought, &#8220;There has to be more people. They got to be out there.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I felt like a detective because I started with nothing. I had him. I knew I had Cornell&#8217;s hip hop archive and I was like, how am I going to find anybody else? So I&#8217;m emailing people, asking people. I did an extensive search. I found out about Aaron Douglas who did illustrations during the Harlem Renaissance, but he wasn&#8217;t really a graphic designer. And I think I accidentally stumbled upon Emory Douglas, who was the Minister of Culture for the Black Panthers. And then Emmett McBain who had his own McBain Associates in Chicago. He had a black ad agency. I don&#8217;t know how I found him. And through him I found Leroy Winbush and Eugene Winslow all of which were black men who had advertising agencies in Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: And then Archie Boston was out there. AIGA had written about him a bunch. So I kept stumbling upon people and I was feeling optimistic and at the end of that semester, that was my first year at MICA. We had to do a presentation of our research. And I did the presentation and my chair at the end of my presentation was like, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you make this AN exhibition?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Okay, I will.&#8221; And I did.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: And it&#8217;s a very graphic designerly exhibition. It&#8217;s 47 posters. It&#8217;s not like things. Of course a graphic designer would make an exhibition of posters and it went up. MICA asked, the communications office, was like, &#8220;Do you want to put together a press release?&#8221; And I was like, I don&#8217;t care. I was just trying to fulfill a requirement for my fellowship to be honest. I wasn&#8217;t thinking about it any deeper than that. And it really took off. People received it well. I think a lot of people were like, I did not know this was needed. And I was like, me neither. I didn&#8217;t know either. I just wanted to do this.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: It was more of a selfish endeavor, more than an endeavor of trying to do some diversity inclusion initiative or something like this. It was just a black man searching for his history in graphic design. It&#8217;s really been received well. The show went to Virginia Commonwealth University. The students in a design research class are actually writing an addendum to Philip Meggs A History of Graphic Design, because he wrote that book while he was at VCU. So now they&#8217;re writing an addendum. I was told that they were going to do this through the class to include these designers and his history in that book, which I didn&#8217;t know that would happen.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: And then the show is also at CCA, California College of Art in San Francisco. And the letter form archive is out there. And they found out about Sylvia Abernathy, who&#8217;s the only woman in my show, unfortunately, sorry. She had these beautiful record sleeves that she designed for Delmark Records for jazz music. They found out about her through me, actually acquired copies of the record sleeves for their archives, and then did an exhibition of design and music. So when I was out there I went to the exhibition and they had Joseph Albert, who was the first chair of Yale&#8217;s graphic design program. He had done some record sleeves for jazz music next to Sylvia Abernathy.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: And that was one of those moments, I didn&#8217;t know that I wanted that. I didn&#8217;t know that I wanted to see this person who is highly celebrated next to this underdog on the same wall doing the same work for the same thing. Those moments are like these surprises that come up along the way. In addition to short conversations that I have with young designers who are like, &#8220;Thank you for doing this.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s accidentally at the service of you, so you&#8217;re welcome. But you do something like this. You do it now. Continue the work.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I&#8217;ve seen some of the posters in the exhibit. It hasn&#8217;t made it to Atlanta yet, nor have I made it to where the exhibits are. But I&#8217;ve seen a couple of photos. I see that there&#8217;s album art from Def Jam, the record sleeves that you mentioned from Sylvia Abernathy, there&#8217;s movie posters from Art Sims who did a lot of work with Spike Lee. And I&#8217;m sure that like you said, you get a lot of questions about it. It&#8217;s getting a lot of feedback. Is there one question in particular that you hate answering about the exhibit?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I can&#8217;t necessarily put it into words, but I think that I always get caught up in some question about buzzwords like representation, diversity, inclusion. These catchall terms that when you see a person who&#8217;s not citizen white, they are fit into these groupings. At this point, me touring the show and doing workshops and stuff. Now I&#8217;m working at the service, but out of service of the field in a way trying to shake things up a little bit, because I see there&#8217;s the need. But initially, no, it was a selfish endeavor. I just wanted to know.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I needed to know and I needed to be able to defend my work and talk about my work, which came from a lineage of black designers and be able to defend that when people ask me about my work or why things look the way they do, et cetera. And so something about that feels a little reductive. Let&#8217;s just say, is this a diversity inclusion thing? Because what happens is if there&#8217;s something, dealing with the queer community, then you&#8217;re still put in a marginalized group. This is a queer thing. This is a black thing. It&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s a graphic design thing actually, and it&#8217;s been neglected. Just normalize it. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: With revision path and I know that feeling that you&#8217;re talking about, because I started revision path honestly under part selfish part I guess petty I guess. And I&#8217;ve told this story on the show before, but I initially had the idea to do this way back in 2006. I had this event that I had created called the Black Web Blog Awards and one of the categories was for best blog design. And it&#8217;s interesting you mention vibe and album covers and stuff like that, because I knew who those designers were. I knew the people that were making those designs and they were not getting any level of recognition. I&#8217;m not talking about an interview here or there. Nobody knew who they were. Nobody was mentioning them. Nobody was talking about them. No one was asking them to speak anywhere or anything like that.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: And I wanted to do something around black design back then, but I was doing the Black Web Blog Awards, I was in grad school, and I was working a full time job. So I was like, I don&#8217;t have time to do all this. It wasn&#8217;t until seven years later after I had stopped working for corporate America, started my studio and was five years in on that. I was like, I have time to do this. So I really honestly did it as a selfish/petty thing, one to put my thumb in the eye of graphic design in terms of the graphic design community to be like we&#8217;re here, you just don&#8217;t see us for some reason. I don&#8217;t know. But then also to do it because I wanted to see more of us out there and I felt like, I don&#8217;t know who else is really doing this, at least on a level that is picking up any level of visibility.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: So I&#8217;m just going to try to add to it. I knew I wasn&#8217;t the first to do it, but I also hope that I&#8217;m not the last to do it too. So I get that feeling because what ends up happening is that as the project gains steam and gets out there in the community, it gets out there in the world really, other people start ascribing values to it that have nothing to do with why you started it. So like with revision path, people will say that it&#8217;s for people of color in the tech industry. It&#8217;s for black people. You can say black. You can say that. You don&#8217;t have to to codify it in that way. You can say it because that&#8217;s what it is. Or they&#8217;ll say, it&#8217;s only for African Americans looking to get into Silicon Valley.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: No, it&#8217;s not. I talk to people all over the world, not just in Silicon Valley, not just trying to get into tech. And I end up having to do a lot of clarification because people want to ascribe their own values to it because they see it, or at least they&#8217;re using it as a resource for diversity and inclusion. And that was never my initial goal for it. It was really just I want to see more of us out there and I want to celebrate what we&#8217;re doing and what we&#8217;re contributing. I&#8217;m not doing this as some sort of a way to highlight a deficit. I think AIGA already does a great job of that. This is no shade by saying that by the way, but they do the design census. They point it out every year so that&#8217;s a fact.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: That was also problematic too, because people who are like me who are self-taught designers are not filling out that survey because they don&#8217;t know about it. They&#8217;re not a part of the AIGA. They&#8217;re making the things that they make. There&#8217;s a website called seven days, seven nights, which does nightlife in the New York City area and around the United States in general. But the pen and pixel aesthetic is still there. They&#8217;ve definitely pushed it forward. None of those designers are filling out that survey, because it&#8217;s Latino and black parties, I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s Latino and black people designing those things. So I feel like there&#8217;s still work to be done because there&#8217;s a whole batch of people who are making good money doing that kind of work and are not being included or their careers are not being acknowledged.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: And one interesting footnote on the whole pen and pixel style. I really love that style. For those that are maybe not familiar, go to Google images, look up Master P, Mia X, Silkk The Shocker, Juvenile. It&#8217;s the gilded cera font with the baguette diamonds for text kind of thing. And I think it was the art directors club or the type directors club or someone did a version of that for their young guns. I might be completely getting this wrong, but I remember the backlash from it from people saying, honestly it was mostly from black people saying, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that you would represent design in this way. It looks so ghetto. It looks so hood.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, it looks like it&#8217;s design. Granted the way they did it, it did kind of make it look like the guy was a pimp inside of the art director club image with gold teeth and he had a forefinger ring. It wasn&#8217;t the best I guess presentation, but I got where the inspiration was coming from.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I&#8217;m not going to go too long on this, but the owner, Sean Burch, I don&#8217;t know how to say his name. He&#8217;s contacted me twice about including the work from pen and pixel in my exhibition. In fact, I can open the email right now. He made the point that, my studio was not a black studio. He basically didn&#8217;t want the public to think that pen and pixel was a black owned business. I can even read the email right now.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: This isn&#8217;t an expose is it?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: No, it&#8217;s not an expose. I really don&#8217;t care because pen and pixel doesn&#8217;t exist anymore. It hasn&#8217;t existed for a really long time and it&#8217;s been featured. They&#8217;ve been getting a lot of press. People have featured them. But the work that gets featured has been, even in Sean Burch&#8217;s own words, was art directed by Master P, Baby Slim, DJ Screw. These people came in and said, &#8220;You know what I want? I want a Mercedes. I want a photo of me bent over the Mercedes. I want two lions on the side. I want diamonds in the text.&#8221; This is the work of an art director. For me and you pen and pixel is working more as a production designer because not all of their work looks like that. And I tried to explain that to him clearly. We had a long phone conversation and he pulled out the, &#8220;I have black friends.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Anyway, he emailed me a picture of his employees with his one black designer on the team. I was like dude. I was like do you know this is racist? Do you know?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Listen, I&#8217;ll add a little something to the anecdote, not necessarily pen and pixel related, and I&#8217;m not going to name names here, but there a certain show that comes on a certain streaming service that highlights designers. They just had a new season which came up recently. And the people who create that show for example had made sure to reach out to me and mention that they had two black designers this year. Am I supposed to be doing cartwheels in the street over that? Okay, fine, wonderful. Thanks, that&#8217;s great. Because the first season they only had one so progress.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I do have to say, I try to listen to other design podcasts but there&#8217;s such a ubiquity. I&#8217;ll listen to the person and look at the work and I&#8217;m like yo, you keep interviewing the same person over and over again. There might be a shift in medium, but the work all looks the same and it&#8217;s really boring. And that goes back to the stupid modernism thing. It&#8217;s like you got to love a little sans serif typeface. Y&#8217;all love their modernist principles. Just build another Bauhaus. I&#8217;m honestly sick of it. There&#8217;s so many other ways to do a piece of graphic design to approach in any medium. Anyway, that&#8217;s not your podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Present company excluded.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: The people you interview are very diverse and it makes me very happy. I&#8217;ve been listening for years. Shout out to you, Maurice.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Thank you. I&#8217;m curious, do you think that your exhibit would have gotten the same visibility if it weren&#8217;t at MICA? Let&#8217;s say if it was at the Lewis Museum? For people listening, the Reginald Lewis Museum, it&#8217;s a African American History and Culture museum. Do you think that this exhibit would have gotten the same level of reach to white design spaces?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I don&#8217;t know. I want to suspect. I think no. But what ended up happening and MICA, they asked me, they were like, &#8220;You want us to put out a press release?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yeah, let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; Because that&#8217;s the thing, once it started getting press, people were like, &#8220;Oh shit, there&#8217;s a black show. Let&#8217;s go see it.&#8221; And not just white people, but everybody was like, &#8220;We should go see this. This looks cool.&#8221; And so I don&#8217;t know if the Lewis Museum put out a press release if it would have been received the same way. I don&#8217;t know that. And also like I said, I didn&#8217;t expect anything for the show. Thought it was going to up for two weeks to a month and I was going to take the posters down and throw them away.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I can&#8217;t answer that question, but I suspect the perception of the institution did help. I suspect so. I don&#8217;t know though, because also the reception of the show was such that people did respond well regardless of what, so it might&#8217;ve. The show itself might have also drawn people to the Lewis Museum had it been there. Let me also say this though too. I have not shown at a black institution yet. I would like to. I&#8217;ve been trying to, so if you&#8217;re listening to this and you&#8217;re the HBCU or a white gallery or museum I would like to show my show there. Thanks. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Bring it on down here to Atlanta. We got a few of them. We got Hammonds House. Actually Hammonds House is in my neighborhood. Hammonds House, Spelman has a art museum on campus. So just putting that out there. I&#8217;ve seen the exhibit also been referred to as incomplete. And one thing that you mentioned a little bit earlier in the interview is that there is only one woman in the exhibit, Sylvia Abernathy. Now that it&#8217;s on tour, are you planning on supplementing the exhibit with more designers as you discover more about them?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: No, because I don&#8217;t have time, because I work full time and the exhibition. When I was teaching, I was teaching a two, three course load and that first semester when I was teaching two classes, that time off was the time I would use to research. I literally was taking a part-time job load, maybe 20 hours or so a week just dedicated to the show. And I just don&#8217;t have that time now. I know there&#8217;s more people. The curator of the Lubalin Center at Cooper Union put me on to an article in Idea Magazine, which is a Japanese design magazine from the &#8217;70s and apparently somebody else did an exhibition of black designers in Japan and I looked at the spread. It&#8217;s in Japanese so I don&#8217;t know what it says, but there&#8217;s like 50 plus black designers that were featured, African Americans. And I was like, who are these people? I think the only one who I knew was Georg Olden and the rest of them I was like, I need to look these people up. In addition to Michelle Washington, she knows everybody. She also did a-</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: She knows everybody. She also did a show with Flo, I&#8217;m saying her name wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Fo Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Fo. And back in the back, I need to see documentation of that, too. I didn&#8217;t know that until we ran into Fo at Black in Design. I was like, &#8220;Oh.&#8221; Michelle hadn&#8217;t mentioned it to me. Then I also met other black designers who had done their thesis. I met this guy, Steve, in San Francisco, who did his thesis at RISD back in the 90&#8217;s on black designers and the representation of black people in design. So, it&#8217;s been happening. It&#8217;s just hasn&#8217;t been a thing that has gotten traction.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I think maybe the advantage for me is that, my show is kind of a research guide in a way. When you go to the show, in the didactics, you can see what archive I got the work from, the name of the work, the name of the archive, the city that it&#8217;s in, it&#8217;s almost like encouraging everybody to go ahead and continue the work themselves. If you go to the archive and look at the work or if you go to a digital archive, you might respond to the work differently than I did. So, it&#8217;s like a traveling archive, as exhibition. I mean, that&#8217;s the only thing. I would like to celebrate these shows. I don&#8217;t know. So, I would like to include those more into my work as well, somehow. I just haven&#8217;t figured out how yet.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: So before you mentioned, Vibe magazine and other publications and things, that were influencing you when you were first starting out, who are some of your influences now with your work?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: It was really funny because, I&#8217;ve actually been looking at fine artists more than graphic designers, in addition to video games and things that are not graphic design. Let me see if I can find&#8230; You know, like Lorna Simpson for example, her collage&#8217;s. Or thinking about how Lorna Simpson&#8217;s work and then thinking about how Carol Walker isolates the figure and about how I was doing that. In reference to pin and pixels work, finding those those formal connections and thinking about different ways of applying that formal gesture in different ways, if that makes sense. Aaron Douglas for example, in his work, he uses a hand drawn type face, which looks like an art deco typeface, but he does it the same way on all of his illustrations. So, looking at this artists painting type, in a way.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Who else? There&#8217;s a bunch of people that, fine arts, I look at. Laila Ali, definitely. Glenn Ligon was a huge inspiration on my poster because he has the, I am man, with the notations. I forgot what it&#8217;s called, The Inspection Report or something like, This Quality Inspection Report, something like this, where he was pointing out the flaws in the poster. And that led me to do the markings. That and also looking at BASCA and doing the markings on the poster that advertises the exhibition itself.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. That&#8217;s a really dope poster, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Thank you. I appreciate that. And so, it&#8217;s this idea of searching, but also mark making. And me, I had a very, very messy notebook where I was making connections and I was like, &#8220;Oh shoot, all three of these guys are in Chicago.&#8221; Okay, sorry. That was a long ramble. But, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: No, no. As I was saying, I really liked that additional poster. It&#8217;s very rare&#8230; Actually, I wouldn&#8217;t even say it&#8217;s rare. I&#8217;ve never seen Jackie&#8217;s Back on a poster like that. When I saw it I was like, &#8220;Ooh. Are you serious?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I got to interview this guy,&#8221; after I saw that.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: There&#8217;s a couple-</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I don&#8217;t know if a lot of people that know about the classic, that is, Jackie&#8217;s Back. That movie is a classic.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Jackie&#8217;s Back is everything. [crosstalk 00:04:25].</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: It&#8217;s all on YouTube, too. The whole thing is on YouTube.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Yeah, it&#8217;s on YouTube. Jennifer needs to get her money. So, anyway. For those streams. Yeah. I have, I mean whatever, this is going to be controversial. It&#8217;s kind of like, as, not for, and it&#8217;s kind of, moments in black pop culture that are as meaning, like just existing as your natural blackness or meaning, making yourself presentable or respectable or palatable to white people or something like this. So, in the top I have Spike Lee and then I have Tyler Perry crossed out, but that&#8217;s going to be a little controversial. Then I have Jackie&#8217;s Back, but then not Sparkle. Because Jackie&#8217;s Back was mocking a blaxploitation film, where Sparkle was a blaxploitation film. Then I have Richard Pryor, after he comes out behind The Wiz machine and then I have him crossed off as The Wiz machine. I guess all these little black pop culture gems that I put in there because people who get it, get it.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah, exactly. Right. Yeah. So outside of design, you mentioned you choreograph, you DJ? You&#8217;re DJ Glen Coco, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Yes, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: What do you spin?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: It&#8217;s a very specific reference. If you get it, you get it.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Okay. Well, what do you spin?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Oh, mostly black ass music. I play cookout music. So, it&#8217;s Evelyn Champagne King, Love Come Down. Luther Vandross. There was this moment between disco and the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s and then house music and the 90s, when black people were making this dance music, but it wasn&#8217;t a specific genre. It was just kind of like The Whispers. I don&#8217;t [crosstalk 00:52:23]-</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Oh, I love that genre.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I don&#8217;t know what that&#8217;s called. But, that&#8217;s what I play mostly and house music and disco and contemporary stuff that sounds like that. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I&#8217;ve heard the music called&#8230; So, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard of the Axle F Party. Have you heard of this?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Okay. So, Axle F Party is this party in DC where they play all this music. It&#8217;s from &#8217;77 to &#8217;87. It&#8217;s Jheri curl funk, champagne soul, laser boogie. Those are the terms that they call that genre of music. If you&#8217;re in DC, you got to check it out. Even looking at the flyers and everything, the flyers are very much in the style, I wouldn&#8217;t say in the pin and pixel style but, I think even if you look at the flyers, you&#8217;re like, Oh, you can tell that they are pulling this inspiration directly from that time period. That music that mixes R&amp;B with synths and vocoders and other electronic things of the time. I mean, I love that genre of music. It&#8217;s so good.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Yeah. That whole moment for me is, I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s something about it. If I&#8217;m at the grocery store and I hear, Patrice Rushen&#8217;s, Forget Me Nots, I can&#8217;t stay still. I&#8217;m like, How do you listen to that and stand still? You just can&#8217;t. That whole moment is maybe, my favorite little moment in music history. It&#8217;s just, nobody ever decided to call it a thing. Which is okay, I think I&#8217;m okay with that.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: I call it the shoulder music. Sometimes, you got to just like-</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Ooh, I like that.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: You got to hit it with the shoulder, sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Cookout music is the closest. When you say cookout music, black people are like, &#8220;Oh, yeah. I get it.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. You definitely got to have some Frankie Beverly and the Maze in there. Some Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. So, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Do you have a dream project that you&#8217;d love to do one day? That maybe melds all of these things that you&#8217;re passionate about?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I have two and knowing me, I mean, if you&#8217;ve known me since I was a kid, I was always doing, at least, three or four things. In high school I ran track, I choreograph for the dance team, I used to sketch and I was also part of a youth organization called, City Kids. We used to do youth empowerment. I did a lot. So, this is just who I am.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: But my two dream things, dream projects are, I want to start a dance company. I don&#8217;t want to dance, I want to start a dance company. And I want to represent African-American design, street dance, things like this, on a concert dance stage and tour. I think that would be awesome, just black dance all the time on stage and get paid for it.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: The other thing is I would like to start a nonprofit research organization for marginalized American aesthetics and design methodologies, because outside of the neglected history of black design, I know everybody else has their own history, it&#8217;s also been kind of shunned as well, and something that&#8217;ll bring those to the forefront&#8230; In my head, it will help to transform the trajectory of design, moving forward and maybe, help diversify the way that things look. There was a article even on my Medium today, I get a Medium Digest every morning and it was, why do all websites look alike? I was like, exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Oh my God. I brought that up. Actually, I read that article. I brought it up in an interview I did recently about how all websites have the same hero image, three column whatever, parallax scrolling thing. Yeah, I saw that article.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, it&#8217;s a thing. I feel like a lot of other people are sick of it, too. It&#8217;s a trickle down effect and I feel like it happens every couple of years. I feel like people in academia and culture write these essays and do exhibitions and talk about a thing enough, where people on the ground who are designing, all have this acknowledgement and say, &#8220;Oh, shit. Maybe we make a shift.&#8221; Then the shift happens. So, I feel that we&#8217;re in this moment now, and there&#8217;s a lot of folks in the design world, like Ramon Tejad at RISD and Silas Munro at&#8230; Have you interviewed Silas?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah, episode 85.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Oh, shoot. Okay. I have to go back. Silas at Otis. I feel everybody&#8217;s tired of&#8230; Ramon and Silas have a thing called, Throw The Bauhaus Under The Bus, which I love. Questioning the Bauhaus, not shitting on the Bauhaus. Because they did have a huge contribution to design, but just also questioning it. Then as far as queer representation goes, Nate Piper and Nicole Kilian. They&#8217;re thinking about publishing and black publishing is not [inaudible 00:12:06]. So, everybody&#8217;s doing really cool shit. I feel like something&#8217;s happening right now. I mean, even thinking about your podcast and being a part of that as well. Because you get the conversations, not the neatly tied up essays and lectures.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. I try to add a lot of diversity into what could be seen as a monolithic set of people. I try to get not just the top designers, captains of industry in Silicon Valley, I talk to folks in New York. I just spoke to a young lady yesterday in Fayetteville, Arkansas, about the UX community there, which, they have a UX community in Fayetteville, Arkansas, in case people didn&#8217;t know about that. I talk to people in the Caribbean, throughout Europe, throughout Africa. I&#8217;ve interviewed two people in Australia. I would love to get a black Brazilian on the show. I would love to just know about what the design scene is in Brazil, since it&#8217;s the largest country, but just in general.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: So, I try to add a lot of nuance and diversity into that, because I think people can see black designer and think just one thing. Also sometimes, and this is, I&#8217;m not trying to take shots here, but sometimes, especially with black media, when the term black design gets thrown out, it often ends up only being kotumb to the realm of fashion. They&#8217;re not looking at the web or graphic design or arts, in that way. It&#8217;s like, Oh, black fashion designers. We&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, what about the rest of us?&#8221; So, yeah. I get that.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Also the same thing with my exhibition, it&#8217;s the same sentiment. You can walk in and say this is black design, but then you have hip-hop party flyers and Black Panther, newspapers and Marlboro advertisements by having Emmett McBain and Cey Adams, The Violator, artwork from &#8217;99 and Sun Ra, Sun Ra&#8217;s poems from his book, The Immeasurable Equation and Sylvia Abernathy&#8217;s jazz. It&#8217;s such a diverse group of work, that when you walk in, you&#8217;re saying these are black people, but there&#8217;s no monolith there. And each one has its own history. Sylvia Abernathy with the Black Arts Movement. Amiri Baraka and Cey Adam&#8217;s huge contribution to hip-hop and the Black Panthers influence. It&#8217;s so many moments in history through this [inaudible 01:00:51] that you can&#8217;t walk away from this collection of work thinking about black people in one way.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. So speaking of black people, and I think also, just speaking of the future, we both were at a Black In Design. This year the theme was Black Futurism 2019, we are now at the end of the year, we&#8217;re at the end of a decade, we&#8217;re really going into the future. When you think of years that sit in pop culture as the future, there&#8217;s 1984, 1999, 2020 not just a news show, but you think of that as a future, ahead. When you look ahead, let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s 2025, what is Jerome working on?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: That is a good question. I think that might be my planning phase for the next step. I would, right now, want to further build my portfolio in arts and culture and nonprofits and working with artists who speak up for marginalized communities. Louis Flemings project, like the queer in black communities and build up that set of work. And then with that sort of work, start doing my dream, one of my dream projects.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: The research nonprofit, most definitely, is a huge&#8230; For me, it&#8217;s something important because I don&#8217;t know if anybody else is doing it. I have to do my research to see if it&#8217;s happening and if it&#8217;s not, then I definitely want to exploit that opportunity and really try to shift the dominance of the way things look right now. Like, all websites look alike. And if not that, if I get tired of design, I&#8217;m kind of tired of design, in a way. Because I feel like I&#8217;m fighting hard and I feel like I work really hard. I feel that all designers might feel this way. You do a lot of stuff, you&#8217;re staying in front of your computer for hours, you&#8217;re arguing with vendors and then you finally get a poster or a website or something. People look at it for two seconds and walk away, you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. I mean, digital design can be very, well it is, very ephemeral in that way. We spend so much time on something which has such a very short half-life, once it&#8217;s out there in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I feel design itself is not, for me, not very important. It&#8217;s a set of skills. It&#8217;s a set of tools to get to essentially, help people. Right? You make things for people. So the thing itself is not really that important. I think that the reasons and the implications and the intentions behind what you do, is the more important thing. I feel like a lot of people should stop designing because they&#8217;re just making bullshit and wasting time.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: That&#8217;s a bold statement.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I mean, for real. It&#8217;s a lot of stuff out there that doesn&#8217;t need to exist. Especially with the condition of the world right now. You&#8217;re privileged by default to sit in front of a computer and make images all day. So, why wouldn&#8217;t you use that position to do something?</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. See, that&#8217;s really what I like about the&#8230; To bring up the Black In Design Conference again, what I really like is that these are people that have design skills, clearly. But they&#8217;re using them in ways that are affecting and impacting the community. I first went in 2015 and it was about how do we affect the physical space from the neighborhood, to the city, to the state, to the region. Then in 2017, it was around spaces for organizing and for protest. Now this year, it&#8217;s about really, black people in the future, black justice black, black-</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Wakanda.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: Yeah. Wakanda, basically. Black utopia. How do we take these skills and use them to ensure that we are in the future. So, I totally agree with that. Yeah. Well, to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work, online?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: I pretty much have my CV on my&#8230; My website&#8217;s pretty much an interactive CV, at this point. My website is jwhgd.co and that&#8217;s also my Instagram. So, @jwhg.co and I also have an Instagram for my choreography that I do here and there. It&#8217;s @32counts. @32counts. The number&#8217;s 3-2, don&#8217;t type out thirty-two and that&#8217;s really it. If you want to give money to Housing Works, comes on to the fundraisers and yeah, that&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s really it.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Cherry</strong>: All right, sounds good. Well Jerome Harris, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I mean, one, I think for an enlightening conversation about the work that you&#8217;re doing or the work that you done through your exhibit, but also, to show that&#8230; It&#8217;s interesting how even with the advent of technology design, or at least entry into the design industry, still seems to be roped into these particular narratives around, you have to have went to these schools or done these things or all this sort of stuff. I&#8217;m a self taught designer, too. I didn&#8217;t go to design school, so to be able to use the talents that you have, to not only, one, make a living for yourself, but also, to showcase others that are doing this, to help change and rewrite the canon of design history. I mean certainly, I empathize with that, because it&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing with Revision Path. So, I applaud anybody that&#8217;s also walking that same path and making sure that more of us are being celebrated. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Harris</strong>: Thank you. This was awesome.</p>

<p>If you have followed me and Revision Path since at least 2015, then you&#8217;ll hopefully recognize how powerfully significant this week&#8217;s guest is. Cheryl D. Miller holds many titles &#8212; visual artist, designer, author, writer, and theologian. Her trailblazing 1985 graduate thesis at Pratt Institute helped fuel the conversation about diversity in design for Black designers and designers of color &#8212; a conversation we&#8217;re still continuing over 30 years later.</p>
<p>Cheryl and I talk about her multicultural upbringing, her time as a student at MICA and Pratt, and she shared her memories of life as a designer in NYC during the 80s and 90s. We also spoke about the latest chapter of Cheryl&#8217;s design career &#8212; <a href="https://library.stanford.edu/node/142441" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">the acquisition of her personal work archive by Stanford University</a>! Cheryl is living design history, and I&#8217;m so glad to be able to share her story here with you all!</p>

<p>As a digital creator, you may not even think much about the concept of digital governance. Don&#8217;t worry though &#8212; this week&#8217;s guest, Lisa Welchman, literally wrote the book on digital governance!</p>
<p>Our conversation begins with an overview on the topic, and Lisa describes how she got involved with digital governance. We also get into digital ethics, talk about how companies can apply digital governance to what they do, and a lot more. Lisa also discusses her recent vacation, the things that keeps her inspired and opens up on what she wants to do in the near future. Thank goodness we&#8217;ve got experts like Lisa to help decipher concepts like this that are important to our digital lives!</p>
