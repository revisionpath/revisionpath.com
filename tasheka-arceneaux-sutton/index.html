Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>I first learned about Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton way back in 2015 when I interviewed <a href="/silas-munro/" data-wpel-link="internal">Silas Munro</a>. Since then, Tasheka has gone on to become one of the leading voices behind discovering Black people omitted from the graphic design history canon. Even design legend <a href="/dr-cheryl-d-miller/" data-wpel-link="internal">Dr. Cheryl D. Miller</a> has sung her praises, so I knew I had to sit down with Tasheka and learn more about her remarkable journey.</p>
<p>Tasheka spoke to me about her experience as an educator and researcher, including an examination of her teaching philosophy. She also talked about growing up in New Orleans, her shift into design, working for the Navy Reservists, and even starting her own studio, <a href="https://blacvoicedesign.myportfolio.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Blacvoice Design</a>. Lastly, she discussed her upcoming book <em>Black Design in America</em>, and shared how the different aspects of her work keep her motivated and inspired. </p>
<p>If there&#8217;s any lesson you learn from Tasheka, it should be this one: you have control over your own path as a designer, so work hard and you can make your dreams come true!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Hi, and first, I want to say Maurice, thanks for having me here on Revision Path. I&#8217;ve been a listener for a long time now, so I feel really grateful and honored to be here. My name is Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton. I&#8217;m a designer, design educator. I run a design studio called Blacvoice. I also am a researcher, I guess, or design historian in regards to Black designers, as well as design writer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has this year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Very busy, but good for the most part. It&#8217;s been a really, really good year with lots of new projects on the horizon. Exciting and exhausting, all at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Any plans for the summer?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, family vacation is one of the plans. I will be attending Typographics, and I&#8217;ll be a speaker there. So it&#8217;s exciting because I&#8217;ve never been to the conference before, and it&#8217;s kind of strange to have that my first attendance there would be me actually giving a talk, so I&#8217;m excited about that. I&#8217;m going to be teaching, I guess, this summer. I don&#8217;t normally teach in the summer, but I&#8217;m co-running a design residency program at the University of Texas, Austin where I teach. So I&#8217;m looking forward to that as well. And I have a couple of writing projects that I&#8217;ll be working on over the summer, and some design stuff as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Sounds like you&#8217;re going to have a busy summer ahead.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, speaking of teaching, you are teaching at two universities right now. You&#8217;re at Vermont College of Fine Arts, and you&#8217;re at the University of Texas at Austin, which is pretty new. You&#8217;ve been at VCFA what, for 10, 11 years now?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s been 10 years in April. 10 years. I started there in 2013.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
It&#8217;s kind of crazy to think that I&#8217;ve been there that long, actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What has the experience been like there?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Wow. The experience at VCFA has been truly amazing and transformative, and I think a lot of it has to do with the amazing faculty that&#8217;s there, that I teach with, who are not only colleagues but longtime friends now. It has to do with the sort of non-traditional structure of the program. We don&#8217;t have any classes or any courses. The program is, if you think about it as a two-year-long independent study, basically it&#8217;s a self-directed program where students decide on what they want to study and what they&#8217;re interested in. And the faculty is there basically, to sort of guide them and offer them resources, but it&#8217;s a self-directed program.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s really interesting. No classes or courses?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you don&#8217;t have to put any curriculum together. That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
No. So yeah, it&#8217;s definitely a different experience. So you do work with the students during the residency to come up with a semester plan on what they&#8217;re going to be working on throughout the semester. So as a faculty, you are there to help guide them and shape that semester plan. But again, it starts with what they&#8217;re interested in. We meet once a month. Students send their work via email, and then we have an hour conversation through, usually Zoom, and to talk about the work and sort of reflect on it, and kind of give feedback on how to move forward over the next month.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love how sort of open that is, especially I think during this time when I know we&#8217;re not out of the pandemic, but certainly, I think it&#8217;s still a time where some schools are trying hybrid models or things. That sounds like the way that it&#8217;s set up at VCFA, it allows you to really still be able to learn in that type of environment.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes. I think the one thing that at the core of the program is, first of all, it&#8217;s really tailored to, working professionals are people. You don&#8217;t have to quit your job for two years to get an MFA. You can still work or run your business, or whatever it is you&#8217;re doing and still go to school. And this is something that we&#8217;ve been doing prior to the pandemic.</p>
<p>So when the pandemic happened, not saying that it didn&#8217;t change the program and how we teach, but we were already sort of interfacing in that way. So the only thing it stopped was having the week long residencies that we would have twice a year in person. Then that programming got moved to Zoom. But as far as the interaction between the student and the teacher, or we say the student and the advisor, that was already happening.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now one of the professors that&#8217;s also there, we&#8217;ve had on the show. Oh God, that was a long time ago. We had Silas Munro on the show. This was I think, episode 85, 86, something like that. But he&#8217;s also a professor there, I believe.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. So Silas, so you brought Silas up. Silas is one of the reasons, that&#8217;s how I ended up at VCFA actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
He&#8217;s one of the founding members of the program and Silas and I, we overlap by a year at CalArts. And so yeah, when the program was starting up, he sent me an email and asked me to join the faculty. And I wasn&#8217;t able to join at the time because of obligations with teaching. But then the following semester in April of 2013, I was able to come on board as a visiting, as a guest. Sort of a preliminary or, I wouldn&#8217;t say probationary period, but just to test to see if it would work out for me and if it would work out for the program.</p>
<p>So yeah, I credit Silas to bringing me in to a community in the program that&#8217;s, like I said, it&#8217;s been really transformative. Especially, the sort of approach to design pedagogy, this openness and not having this one idea of what design is. That sort of shift and change and marks according to the students, and the type of work that they&#8217;re interested in, and the type of diversity and the faculty and what we study and research, and type of work we&#8217;re engaged in. So that&#8217;s the thing that I really like, and it&#8217;s probably one of the few places that I&#8217;ve worked where I really felt a sense of family with my coworkers. Not that I didn&#8217;t have that relationship with other places, but there it&#8217;s really genuine. It&#8217;s not forced, it&#8217;s not fake. We actually truly do like and love each other.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, first of all, props to Silas for bringing you in, but it sounds like it is a great environment because you&#8217;ve been there for 10 years. Nobody&#8217;s going to stay there for 10 years if it&#8217;s not good.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, no, that&#8217;s true. Actually, you saying it, it&#8217;s technically the longest job I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
When I think about it, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;re also teaching at University of Texas at Austin, which is fairly new. Tell me more about that. How&#8217;s that experience?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Wow, it&#8217;s been great, to be honest. I haven&#8217;t been there that long. I just moved to Austin, so I&#8217;m new to Austin and I&#8217;m new to UT. It&#8217;s been a really good experience as far as working in an environment with, I guess kind of similar to VCFA, where you don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s this sort of one way that the faculty or the program is trying to teach design. It&#8217;s a little bit more flexible, it&#8217;s a little bit more nuanced where students get to dabble in a lot of different areas of design. Graphic design, industrial design, interactive design, design history, product design. So it&#8217;s really sort of flexible in that way and that&#8217;s one of the things that sort of drawed me in into UT.</p>
<p>The program itself was revamped around 2017, 2018. So the program as it is today, design, it&#8217;s the Department of Design and Creative Technology, is fairly new in a sense compared to a lot of other programs that are out there. So I think there&#8217;s something about that sort of newness. There&#8217;s a lot of vulnerability and a lot of questioning about the direction of the program. So it&#8217;s kind of exciting to be somewhere where we&#8217;re constantly thinking about ways to evolve and improve the experience for the students.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What is your teaching philosophy? I would imagine, between the work you&#8217;ve done at VCFA and are currently doing, and now with teaching at UT. And you&#8217;ve taught at some other places as well. What&#8217;s your overall teaching philosophy?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Well, one is, I try to approach teaching, one of the things that probably on the first day of class, I let my students know that, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m interested. I&#8217;m more interested in what you&#8217;re interested in learning, and what you&#8217;re interested in general out there in the world.&#8221; Not that I don&#8217;t have anything to impart or to give to them, but it&#8217;s less about me walking into the classroom saying, &#8220;Hey, listen up, I&#8217;m the expert here. You all need to learn what I have to offer.&#8221; Obviously, there is an important exchange that&#8217;s sort of happening, but I&#8217;m not interested in the hierarchies that traditionally plagues, I think, academia. So that&#8217;s the first thing is, to let my students know, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m curious about you, who you are as a person, and what you&#8217;re interested in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other part of my teaching philosophy is, so how do I nurture that? How do I give them assignments, and give them projects and things to learn, to help nurture those interests? So often, I give projects and things that are about to help students investigate their community, and their environment and their identity. I think it&#8217;s really important for students to feel a connection to the project brief, to what they&#8217;re working on. And to figure out how to sort of channel their life&#8217;s experiences, as well as who they are into their projects. There are some practical exercises that are given to topography to talk about kerning and leading and that kind of stuff. But the start of bigger projects, I really try to figure out how to give assignments to help them sort of explore who they are in their environment and their community. Also, really, I think it&#8217;s important, one of my other goals is to make sure that I&#8217;m giving them projects or I&#8217;m giving them things to read and write about, and to consider about what&#8217;s going on in the world.</p>
<p>I like having discussions and I don&#8217;t shy away from, I won&#8217;t say controversial conversations, but I don&#8217;t like to shy away from, there&#8217;s always a group of students that have a certain perspective about another thing, and then you might have another group that have a different perspective. So I like having those type of conversations so we can learn from each other, because too many times that we all are always listening to and engaging in conversation with people who have the same perspective as we do. So, I always often give reading assignments, or articles or essays, or just come up with topics or things that might make some of them feel uncomfortable sometimes, where they have to talk about things that they don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s going to be received by their classmates. And also, try to give them a sort of sense of agency and responsibility when it comes to their own learning, and not just take everything at face value to question, even question me, right? But obviously with the mutual respect, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;d love to hear an example of something you would cover in class with your students.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Sometimes, it&#8217;s as simple as, I think this project isn&#8217;t something kind of, out of the park, but giving them &#8230; One time I had students design sort of protest signage. So they could approach it with whatever topic, anything that they felt really strongly about. Some people feels really strongly about, you should have solar panels on your house. Some people still feel really strongly about abortion, which sometimes for me, some of these topics that are still surfacing are kind of surprising. And some people feel strongly about police rights and things like that.</p>
<p>So any type of way I can give them some kind of assignment that addresses these issues, usually I try to get them to think about stuff that&#8217;s relevant in the media. Things that people are on opposite sides or sort of butting heads about, just to see, how do you handle that in the design context? Even, how do you handle as a designer having conversations about, &#8220;Well, if you have a very specific social or political agenda, what does it means to do design? Or could you do design for somebody to have a different perspective than you do?&#8221; So those type of conversations I think, are important to have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I totally think that&#8217;s important because at any point throughout your design career, you&#8217;re going to encounter some conflict. I mean, I think we know the goal is to try to not have this sort of conflicts with clients or prospective clients or anything like that, but it&#8217;s going to happen. I mean sometimes you&#8217;ll have a client, you think they&#8217;re one way, and then you start working with them and it&#8217;s completely different. And even as you&#8217;ve said about personal views and such like that, it can get really tricky because the world is not just, I mean, not to use this as a racial thing, but it&#8217;s not a black and white place. There&#8217;s all sorts of ambiguity and things in there. So the fact that you&#8217;re able to work out those scenarios and issues with students in a learning environment is really important, because then they don&#8217;t get out there in the real world and have greater consequences for those sorts of scenarios.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. So that&#8217;s one of the reasons why I do it, because I feel like if we can&#8217;t have these open discussions and conversation and academic space, then what&#8217;s the point of education or school in that environment? At least, that&#8217;s how I look at it.</p>
<p>Another project that I did when I was working at NC State last year was, I tasked my students with doing some design research in their hometown. So if they were from Charlotte, if they were from, I don&#8217;t know, somewhere in Germany, it didn&#8217;t really matter where they were from, but they had to do research about design in their particular community, where they were from. It was up to them if they wanted to pick where they live presently or somewhere where they were raised. And I gave them some sort of guidelines or places to start, I would say, because obviously if you said, &#8220;Okay, go research Charlotte, they may not know where to start.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I gave them four different areas to start. So I said, &#8220;Hey, why don&#8217;t you research the educational institutions, find out what schools offer design programs and research their faculty to see who&#8217;s working there? What type of design work or research that they do? Research the history publications in your particular area,&#8221; because I think newspapers and those type of print media is a good place to find the history of a place, sort of like the pulse, right? Design studios, talk to people there, make a list of all the ones that exist, maybe find out information about ones that used to exist. And I think the last place was printers. If they&#8217;re like print shops, go talk to those people. So those were the different areas as far as starting points that I gave them to start their research.</p>
<p>And then they had to interview people to help fill in the gaps of trying to create that sort of storyline. Because part of what they had to actually design was some kind of information design, but this wasn&#8217;t about charts and graphs. It was more like a storytelling or narrative sort of based research project, if you will. And then it was all the data, information was sort of collected in this zine that each student sort of designed together, and got it professionally printed at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>And I think it was a really good project. They learned a lot about design from where they were from, that they didn&#8217;t know, that they probably wouldn&#8217;t have even thought about if they didn&#8217;t have this project. And they learned something about themselves. I think for some of them, it was confidence boost. If you&#8217;re from somewhere or you come from an area where maybe design isn&#8217;t talked about or there are not a lot of people you see in design that look like you, and I think this project sort of helped them do some research and some discovery in those areas.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, what do you learn from your students? I mean, you mentioned earlier that you tell them at the beginning of the courses that you&#8217;re interested in learning from them. What kind of things do you learn?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I learn a lot from them. I think I can admit as a seasoned educator professional, but sometimes I go into the classroom with certain types of assumptions or misconceptions. So a lots of times, I might have assumptions what I think they might be interested in or what they should be. But then I learn actually, what they&#8217;re actually more interested in, and that sort of shifts and change sometimes. So for instance, a lot of students, now what I&#8217;m seeing, maybe something that&#8217;s trending because of technology is that, this sort of longing for tactile things, this longing to create and print things. Lots of times I think that students wouldn&#8217;t be interested in learning about letterpress, or screen printing or these sort of, or electroset. Electroset is something I love, doing electroset exercises with my students. And I really enjoy being able to talk to them about the history behind these all ways of printing.</p>
<p>But I find they&#8217;re really interested in these things. And I mean, you do have some that are like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m really more comfortable in a digital space, and that&#8217;s fine.&#8221; Again, I&#8217;m not there to try to not nurture what their interests are. But, I feel like I&#8217;m also there for to say, &#8220;Hey, look over here. There are these other ways of making and approaching design that sort of outside of maybe what you think you should be doing.&#8221; Or lots of times, I feel what I have learned is there are very specific things that sometimes students think, &#8220;Okay, design should be this way or look this way.&#8221; And a lot of it has to do with the tools that they&#8217;re using, because everybody&#8217;s using Adobe Sweden, everybody&#8217;s using Illustrator or whatever. And I try to tell them, &#8220;Well, if we&#8217;re all using the same tools, then everything starts to look the same. But why not take your ideas, and have your ideas and the content have to dictate what type of tool you use.&#8221;</p>
<p>So a lot of times I learn a lot that I shouldn&#8217;t make assumptions, about technology or different ways in which how they&#8217;re interested in making, or what they actually want to make. Sometimes I assume, &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re probably interested in developing an app,&#8221; and they do have those type of interests, or they&#8217;re interested in AI. But then I find so many of them when it comes to technology, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t even want to touch that stuff over there. I want to get my hands dirty.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That is so fascinating to hear that students want to do kind of tactile things. I do a lot of different types of judging throughout the year. I&#8217;ll judge design competitions. I look at portfolios and things like that from students. And I have started to see more actual tactile work books, or pamphlets or zines or something like that. It&#8217;s such a stark contrast to 20 years ago. Now, I didn&#8217;t go to design school, but I knew people that were in design school at the time that I was also in school and everybody wanted a piece of digital. I guess it&#8217;s because it was just coming about at that time. I mean, when I went to college, there were computers. I remember vividly wanting to, I majored in computer science, computer engineering, and then switching my major over to math. Because I told my advisor I wanted to learn web design, and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s a fad. No one&#8217;s going to be into that sort of stuff.&#8221; And the school that I went to didn&#8217;t have an arts program, didn&#8217;t have a design program, so I just switched over to math.</p>
<p>But I knew people that were at the Atlanta College of Art, which existed back then, and the Art Institute of Atlanta. And everybody was just clamoring to try to do something with digital because they were tired of print. They were tired of, I guess, I don&#8217;t want to say they were doing maybe more traditional things like electroset or things like that. But everybody wanted to get in on the newness. And now, 20 years from then when technology is everywhere, now students want to get tactile, they want to make stuff. Yeah, I think that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, I think the thing that I have to keep in mind is that the way they&#8217;re growing up and how they&#8217;re entering these spaces in this world is very different from how I entered it, where I was there prior to computers and then post. Not that, to be honest, I don&#8217;t have the pay stop experience. I mean, I was in school at the advent of, Adobe was already there, Photoshop was already there. The Mac computer was already there in the early two thousands. So I was sort of a little bit post the desktop publishing area. But I think the thing that I forget is that, well, they&#8217;re so consumed, this is all they know. So for them they need a break. They are exhausted from the screen is what they tell me. So they&#8217;re kind of exhausted from it. And so when you show these other analog processes, they really light up. It&#8217;s really nice and encouraging to see that they still have these interests.</p>
<p>But again, there are some that are really interested in the technology. A lot of them are interested in the 3D sort of space and the digital space, but also the physical space. There are sort of a range. But I think that&#8217;s what I learn. The more I teach, the more I learn about what the sort of dynamics to what they&#8217;re interested in. And they have various interests and it&#8217;s not good to even put them into a box and assume what they&#8217;re interested in because, it&#8217;s a lot of different things that are out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I love that. I love that. Students are tired of screens. I&#8217;m loving hearing that. Now, let&#8217;s learn more about you. Let&#8217;s hear your origin story. You&#8217;re originally from New Orleans. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about what it was growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, I grew up in the inner city, not on the outskirts. I grew up in New Orleans, we sort of identified with the wards, which are actually voting wards. So I grew up in the seven ward, New Orleans, which the time that I grew up was predominantly Black or all Black maybe, don&#8217;t know the statistics on that, but a very urban inner city. Grew up poor, single mom, family. I&#8217;m the oldest of four siblings. Had a good childhood. I remember going outside and play, making games up as we go, just started using resources and things that we had around to play different sports, so to do different things. My mom was always really supportive in whatever it was I wanted to do. So when I was younger, I wanted to go to law school. Actually, I wanted to be an attorney. And so, I actually approached going to college, thinking that I was going to go to law school and practice law, actually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow. What interested you about law?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
To be honest, Maurice, it was, the part of it that was probably really superficial, meaning I watched a lot of court shows growing up, and I got sucked into the drama of the investigations. And this aha moment when the real person, suspect was revealed. And the banter in the court and the back and forth between the attorneys, all the drama. So that seemed exciting because I always felt like, I&#8217;ve always had a strong voice, I guess, and a strong personality and perspective in that way. I can be very argumentative about things that I&#8217;m super passionate about. So I just thought I would be a good attorney. Why not? I was a good student, usually brought home good grades. So yeah, I could do this law school thing, and I can go to law school and do that.</p>
<p>The other side of it is, I also saw law as something that oppressed us as a people for a long time, and I wanted to understand it better to help us. So that was the sort of flip side of my interest in going to law school. But yeah, that faded when I actually, I mean I was really, up until my last year in college, I was still pursuing going to law school, to be honest.</p>
<p>Now, I was at Loyola, I was an English writing major. And the reason I picked that major was because I was told &#8230; I can&#8217;t remember if it was a job fair or a college fair when I was in high school and somebody said, &#8220;Oh, people who do really well in law school, they major in English because of all the writing and research you have to do,&#8221; whatever. So that&#8217;s really how that came about. And I did a lot of reading growing up. So the idea of having to read and write was kind of made sense, something I was sort of interested in. So yeah, that&#8217;s how that came about was because I wanted to be a good law student, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you had been on this path, I mean, to the point where you went to school, you were studying in it, you were getting all the way up to your senior year. Was there a deciding incident that kind of changed your trajectory?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
The incident was preparing to take the LSAT, I would say. So it was more like a process. So I want to say the first semester of my senior year, I was preparing to take the LSAT, researching what schools to go to. And all of that became extremely overwhelming and stressful, but it wasn&#8217;t exciting in a way, how things could be really overwhelming, but you&#8217;re still sort of excited about it, and if it&#8217;s you&#8217;re anxious. And so then I did some soul-searching and it was like, &#8220;Well, why do you want to do this Tasheka? Why do you want to go to law school?&#8221; And so, one of the things that is at the time it was really hard for me to admit, was that I honestly didn&#8217;t think I was good at anything, or I didn&#8217;t know what I was really good at. So because I was always sort of a good student, I just kind of looked at it as that way. I can go to law school, I&#8217;m going to be a good student, and then I&#8217;ll get a decent job.</p>
<p>I have always been a very goal driven oriented person. And so for me, it was always just sort of scratching things off the list. So go to school, major in English writing, do well, go to law school, take the LSAT, get a high grade, study. It&#8217;s just this constant thing. But when I actually really looked within, I realized that, well, I didn&#8217;t want to do it for the right reasons. You shouldn&#8217;t choose a career path just because it&#8217;s sort of checking off the list. I can accomplish this thing, but it&#8217;s not something that, I mean, I had a genuine interest in the law, but when I look back, yeah, it definitely wasn&#8217;t the right path for me.</p>
<p>So I just remember there was this one day, I used to do work study in the library. I just started going online and doing research about what do creative people do. So copywriter came about because I&#8217;m getting a degree in English, but at the time I didn&#8217;t feel too confident about my writing skills. So I was like, &#8220;Eh, I don&#8217;t really want to do that.&#8221; And then I remember, topography kept popping up, and this isn&#8217;t a time where in the early two thousands, when they had a lot of portfolio schools, like Miami AD and those type of schools.</p>
<p>So I was doing research and those type of schools kept popping up, and then I kept seeing topography and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What is topography? I don&#8217;t even know what that is.&#8221; So I looked in the school course catalog and I saw topography one and two, and then it was graphic design and I didn&#8217;t know what any of these, I wasn&#8217;t aware of any of this stuff, or what that meant as far as a career. And so the more I read and the more I did my research, I was like, &#8220;Oh, this design thing sounds really interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the next semester, I just went head first. I signed up to take a type one and a design one class, the year, the semester I was supposed to graduate. And then I fell in love with it. And then I pushed my graduation back about a year so I could get a minor in graphic design. And I didn&#8217;t get a true minor. I kind of had a relationship with the director of the art department at the time, because throughout my time in college, I took drawing and painting classes as my elective, because I&#8217;ve always had an affection for art and drawing. So I talked to her at the time and about getting a minor, and so they sort of told me that, just take the main classes. I didn&#8217;t have to take the foundations and stuff like that. So they sort of fast tracked me into design one and however many classes I could take within a year, because Loyola is a private Jesuit liberal university, just very expensive. And I was on a scholarship, so that extra year, I could only go to school those two extra semesters.</p>
<p>So I did that. After that year, it was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m a graphic designer now. That&#8217;s it. This is what I want to do.&#8221; Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a really interesting turn. I mean, you were already set to go along this way, and then you kind of just had another idea and there you go.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. It wasn&#8217;t something that was obviously planned out in that way, but I&#8217;ve never looked back. I can&#8217;t honestly imagine being in any other field than design, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s really awesome that it sort of came about that way. I&#8217;m curious now on what Tasheka the lawyer would be like, if you would&#8217;ve went there.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I think about it, too. I don&#8217;t know, honestly. I mean, I think there&#8217;s a way that I would&#8217;ve found my niche. I would&#8217;ve found an area of law that would&#8217;ve been good for me. I don&#8217;t know how lucrative that would&#8217;ve been, especially if you think about going to a private undergraduate school, and then law school and then student &#8230; It&#8217;s just sort of the bills and student loans to pile up when you think about it. So yeah, I don&#8217;t know. I think I would&#8217;ve found my way, but I think that it definitely wasn&#8217;t the right path for me. And I think the sort of activist in me, I would&#8217;ve found whatever I guess sort of industry I would&#8217;ve ended up, I think I would&#8217;ve found that sort of angle.</p>
<p>But I do remember this one conversation I had with a lady at a job fair my senior year, and she said that her husband was an attorney and that he had a studio in their attic and he was a painter. And she said that, but once he started really getting into law, he stopped painting as much as he used to. And so I started thinking that I never wanted art to not be a part of my life. So that was sort of a reality check where I was, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want to go into law if this is going to prevent me from being creative or being a maker,&#8221; I guess.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So you graduated from Loyola, and I know later you went and got your MFA from CalArts. Between then, did you get out in the working world and experience a little bit of what it was like to not be a student for a while?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes. It was a very short time. It was exactly a year and four months to date. So yeah, after I graduated, I end up working as a designer at the Navy, which was such a strange thing for me personally, to end up working for the military. But yeah, I worked for the Navy Reservist Public Affairs Office, and they hired me because they saw my resume, that I took topography classes, which is kind of funny when I think about it. Because it&#8217;s like, well, when you go to, you study design, you take topography. It wasn&#8217;t nothing special. But anyway, but one of the other reasons they hired me was because they wanted somebody young with fresh ideas. And at the time, they were publishing and producing a tabloid newspaper. And so they wanted me on board to help transition that newspaper into a monthly magazine.<br>
I actually stayed there long enough just to do that, basically. We had a few firsts. I guess half the time I was there, we were publishing the newspaper. Then the second half, we transitioned over to a magazine, and that&#8217;s my first job. I will say that it was a really great learning experience in school, as far as print production and that kind of stuff. You don&#8217;t necessarily learn. So the Navy, I would drive to Panama City to go see the publication on press, that kind of stuff. So I learned all the production there. So yeah, it was a really good experience for me, as far as my first professional design job.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you were able to get that, I mean, one right out of school because you had this small amount of design experience just from studying, and they were like, &#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;ll go with that.&#8221; Nowadays, for entry level position, they already want you to have three years experience somewhere. So it&#8217;s good that they kind of took a chance and said, &#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;ll move forward and see what you have.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, I will say it was actually a head hunter that found me, or like a temp agency, I would say. And they put me in contact with the Navy. And I think that they were, because they were producing a publication, it was probably a time crunch. And so, I don&#8217;t know if I was the first person they referred them to. I don&#8217;t know if they had interviewed a bunch of other people. I have no idea. But I just knew that, oh, they were also impressed that I studied abroad. I&#8217;m trying to think of the things that they said to me during the interview or that made them sort of intrigued or want me to come in. They liked that I had spent some time abroad and that I took topography courses, to be honest.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Where did you study abroad?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I studied abroad in Prague, in the Czech Republic. And it was mainly, it was more of a printmaking study abroad than graphic design. I mean, the graphic design aspect of it, was it that there was this workshop or this class that we took to set up design posters by hand. All analog, which was great, but it was really for printmaking, like lithography, learning to do aquatints and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And it was interesting, because it was actually with a program that was through NC State, and one of my professors at Loyola at the time was the person who was in charge. I had started that study abroad program. So it was kind of weird last year when I worked at NC State, it was like, &#8220;Oh, I did a study abroad program at this place and now I&#8217;m teaching here.&#8221; So I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s just kind of funny how things kind of happen that way in life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So tell me how your experience was getting your MFA at Cal Arts.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
That in of itself was an experience. CalArts was tough. I mean, I definitely went there knowing that it was going to be difficult, that it wasn&#8217;t going to be easy. Actually, I was there for three years. I got accepted for the three-year track. So a lot of schools now have a three year and a two-year track, and normally the three-year track is reserved for students who don&#8217;t have a traditional graphic design background. And so since my degree wasn&#8217;t in design, it was in English. And then, I had that limited experience, that year and a half working for the Navy. So I actually did three years instead of two. So the first year was, I guess an adjustment and challenging, in and of itself. For one, I was the only Black student there in the graduate and the undergraduate program, which for me was pretty shocking.</p>
<p>And the reason it was surprising is because I think, to be honest, at the time I was just starting, right before grad school and doing my first year of grad school. I was just starting to notice how there was a lack of visibility of Black people in design, or how the design profession didn&#8217;t seem to, or the lack of diversity that existed. Honestly, I don&#8217;t know why it took that long for me to actually realize that, but it wasn&#8217;t until, I think it was the 2004 AIGA conference that I realized that, where I saw maybe four or five other Black people at the conference. It was in Vancouver, I remember that. And then that&#8217;s when, that was not long before I actually started school at CalArts.</p>
<p>So that experience, and that was the thing that I think started me on this kind of trajectory, or the path into doing the research that I do, was looking around, not seeing anybody like me. Not learning anything about anybody who looked like me with the history class, or so, yeah, that&#8217;s sort of where I started. And me being at CalArts as a student, sort of asking the question, talking to faculty or just saying. Even sometimes it was in my work, I was questioning, where are the Black designers? When was the last time CalArts had a Black student in the MFA program? Nobody can answer that question. Or can you tell me something about Black people in design history? Nobody can answer that question.</p>
<p>So it became this thing where, and I know we&#8217;ve done similar sort of scavenger hunts. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Where the hell are all the Black people?&#8221; So anyway, that is where my research started. So because I couldn&#8217;t find anything out there that was tangible to hold onto, I just started doing my own research and investigation. Because I was like, &#8220;There&#8217;s nobody who&#8217;s here to tell me or give me that information. I have to discover it from myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I will say the faculty there was all, for the most part, it was, I felt supported. Although it was tough. It was like bootcamp, going to CalArts. It was a really, really tough, intense program. But I did feel encouraged most of the time for the type of projects that I had. And some of them was filled with a lot of emotion and anger, and aggression and frustration, and a lot of times that came out. But I will say that they sort of helped me nurture and cultivate my voice, and they also always encouraged me to be true, to keep that investigation and then that energy, and to being inquisitive about my design, Black design history, and culture and identity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s such a good thing now that it almost feels like, I&#8217;d say maybe within the past, I don&#8217;t know, 10, 15 years perhaps, we&#8217;ll say that. But we&#8217;ve started to see more Black design educators out there, and we&#8217;ve also started to see community efforts. I mean, Revision Path is one of them, but we&#8217;ve started to also see community efforts with making sure that Black people, and I would say Black and brown, I mean, I would kind of widen that lens a bit. But we&#8217;ve started to see now more people of color in general, being talked about, recognized, showcased, researched as it comes to design. I mean, I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ll get to a point where there&#8217;s full equity with regards to that, but I think within the past 10 years, we&#8217;ve seen a lot of headway in that direction, where we&#8217;re starting to now see more Black students, or at least more talk about Black designers throughout history. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yes, I would agree with that. There is definitely some sort of shift. I mean, if I&#8217;m honest, I&#8217;m not seeing it enough or as much as I would like to see it. But I&#8217;m also aware that things do take time, and especially when you have things that are so systemic and that&#8217;s a part of system that&#8217;s been there for so long that it&#8217;s not, it takes a long time to sort of dismantle it.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m honest, I do believe that it doesn&#8217;t have to, or it shouldn&#8217;t take it as long, but I understand it. I try to understand it. I do think that things can happen a lot quicker, but I do realize that there are still certain structures that are there, that&#8217;s way more difficult to dismantle to where it takes a lot longer. But I am happy to have colleagues. I didn&#8217;t think that I would see a day where I could name at least three other Black women that are doing similar type of work or things like that. So I am happy to see that there&#8217;s a change, and there&#8217;s a lot of work and way more work that needs to be done. But yeah, I agree. There are more efforts, I guess, and more initiatives that are happening at different places.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think with schools, it&#8217;s just always going to take longer because schools are just such, these large institutions. Of course, they get funds from different philanthropists and foundations and stuff like that. But I agree with you, in that I think the change could be happening a lot quicker. I a hundred percent agree with you there.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah. I just think that one of the things that I liked about UT was they started changing their admissions process. I think there are still more work to be done, but they have done away with the traditional portfolio. And so, their admission process is more a design prompt, so a student could &#8230; So the design program looks at just that one particular piece that they&#8217;re doing, and then they submit a 60-minute video that sort of talks about their process and their ideas, alongside the piece that they made for admissions.</p>
<p>So I think that, that takes a lot of pressure off because you still have so many students that, they don&#8217;t have the resources in their high schools to submit even a fine arts portfolio, let alone something that&#8217;s specific to design. Where you need all these different, you need a computer, you need the Adobe software, you need all these digital tools that a lot of high schools still don&#8217;t have those type of resources. So it&#8217;s nice to see that they&#8217;re at least trying to change that process a little bit, to make it more equitable for students of color to have access to the program.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, along with you being a design educator, and you mentioned this a bit earlier, you have your own design studio called Blacvoice Design. Tell me more about that. What are some of the projects or other work that you&#8217;ve done through your studio?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Well, a lot of projects I would say, first start off with the type of clients that I work with. So most of my clients are educational institutions like universities, colleges and things like that, nonprofit organizations, as well as kind of start up or small businesses. And I actually like the work that I do within those spaces. The type of projects that I do, format wise, most of them are books. I design a lot of books, but I don&#8217;t like to just consider myself a book designer because I do do identity projects and things like that. But a lot of the books that I do design, because a lot of my clients have modest budgets, usually I&#8217;m given texts and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>And so, I think that&#8217;s why I wear this hat of an image maker, because a lot of projects might call for me to take photos and I&#8217;ll take my own photographs for a particular project, or I do my own illustrations and create my own imagery for them. And so that I actually like. I like that whole process of generating the imagery, and doing the type setting, and doing the layout and the design. I really do enjoy being a part of that process from the beginning to the end. I thought at this point in my career that I would want to be in a more creative director sort of role, but I actually like and still enjoy being hands on.</p>
<p>So some projects that I&#8217;ve worked on in the past that are really kind of dear to my heart is, I used to do some work for a nonprofit organization. They&#8217;re now called 826 New Orleans, but they used to be called Big Class. And Big Class is a nonprofit organization. They started off basically sort of reaching out to the inner city public schools. And so, they would have writing prompts or writing projects for students to engage in after school. And so they would come up with themes, the students would come up with themes or topics that they wanted to write about. Usually it had to do with their feelings around their culture and their community.</p>
<p>And so, what I would do is basically, I would come in, talk to the student editorial board, find out what ideas they have about the design and the design process, and basically use that as information or inspiration and design a book for these individual projects. And so Big Class would take those books, they would have these readings, they would get people, they had their own press and their own imprint. And so they would publish and sell the books, and then they would just feed and go back into the sort of program. And I really like that program, because it not only gets students excited about writing, and writing is a form of expression, writing can be creative, right? Writing, I think gave them a sense of agency because they get to write, they get to publish, they get to put it out there, they get to have open mic and spoken words.</p>
<p>And so, I really love to see the sort of confidence that it gave these students, that maybe in their school, they may not ever have that type of experience. So for me to provide a platform for them to express themselves through words, through writing, I really did enjoy working with them. But now they&#8217;re part of this larger, more national collection of programs, that&#8217;s like 826 New Orleans, you have 826 Valencia. So 826 sort of exists in a lot of different cities. And my hope is to, there isn&#8217;t an 826 in Austin. Honestly, have no idea how to even start one. And it&#8217;s not that I even want to be in charge of one, but I would love to try to figure out how to create a rapport with some of the schools, some of the public schools here in Austin to try to get one started here. And then that way, it&#8217;s something that I would like my students at UT to be involved in that process, of helping those students design and get their work printed and published.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m a big advocate of designers needing to do more writing. A hundred percent. We had at one point in time, kind of design anthology called Recognize that we were doing through Revision Path, where we had designers just like, we would give a particular prompt or theme. I think the one we did before we shut it down was reset. I think reset was the theme. And so based off of that, we wanted people to submit essays up to 3000 words, centered around reset in whatever way that they wanted to. But it had to be design focused, like design writing. We didn&#8217;t get great ones. I&#8217;ll be completely honest. I think a lot of people rather wanted to design something than write something.</p>
<p>And even the first year that we did it, we would get some pushback from people, &#8220;Well, why do I have to write something?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;It&#8217;s a essay.&#8221; I mean, you have to write something because that&#8217;s the structure of it. I do want to bring it back one day if Revision Path can get the right funding and all of that. Because, I&#8217;m still a big proponent and believer of designers, I think, need to be, they need to know how to write because of course, it just helps you get your ideas out there. But it&#8217;s just so helpful for, and I think this probably ties into your research focus. It ties into your work being part of the cannon. If you can write down what you did, the work you did, case studies, et cetera, if it gets put out there in some way, if it gets preserved in some way, you&#8217;re now part of the cannon.</p>
<p>One thing with me, when I try to find guests for the show, it&#8217;s very hard for me to book a guest when I can&#8217;t find anything on them. I could maybe find-</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, you could maybe do some research.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, yeah, because I can maybe find a website or there&#8217;s maybe a blog post or something somewhere, but I need to be able to see what you&#8217;ve done so I can get a sense of who you are as a designer, if this is going to be a good fit, that sort of thing. But I say all of that to say that I&#8217;m a big, just huge fan of designers being writers, and write it down, write down your work, show your work.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I agree with that too, Maurice. And even as a person, I still think I have a very strange or uncomfortable, I think it&#8217;s a better word, relationship with writing. It&#8217;s something that with my teaching, I always make sure that there&#8217;s some writing component in a project for students, whether it&#8217;s a reflection to something they read or something they saw. I think it&#8217;s really important. I see a lot of similarities in the writing, in the design process. So for me, it&#8217;s been, although it&#8217;s still a place where I&#8217;m super uncomfortable in lots of times, a few years ago, to be honest, I think it was back in 2017 when I was teaching at Southeastern Louisiana University, and I had just gotten tenured there. And I didn&#8217;t realize at the time that until I was at NC State during that interview process, that up until that point, I had got tenured because of my creative work, because of doing exhibitions and things like that.</p>
<p>And at that point, I realized that with the research that I was doing, and then at that time, my research was startup, sporadic, how I was engaged with it. I started this research in graduate school, and then I would start to engage with it from time to time when somebody would ask me to give a lecture. And at some point, going back to what you were saying about the importance of the canon and sort of writing things down, that became a real turning point for me because at that point, I wanted to change my practice a little bit, and have it more focused on writing and publishing. Because in my mind, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, I can continue to do these lectures and talk about this stuff, but then what?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
What do you with it? And so I knew at some point I always wanted to write a book about Black design history. I knew, even from grad school back at CalArts, that&#8217;s something I wanted to do. I think, not until that point, I became more intentional about it. I was like, &#8220;Okay, if I want to shift,&#8221; not do away with making, not do away with freelance, not doing away with that work, but I wanted to be more intentional about the scholarly part of me, I guess, in that work. And sort of getting it out there and not have it just be through lectures. And I think, oral history and that stuff is valuable. I&#8217;m not trying to devalue that at all, but I do think there&#8217;s something about having something written and on a page, and printed and sort of documented. Right? I mean, I think it&#8217;s really important for our work and stuff to be documented, so it can be passed on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Exactly. I mean, the oral storytelling, and I realize we&#8217;re saying this on a podcast, but is mean that is important. But being able to write it down, pass it on, put it in a book, have it stored somewhere, that is what is really, that is the canon. That&#8217;s what you end up preserving. Speaking of books, I mean, we&#8217;re both working on books, but part of the research that I find is trying to find these writings and trying to find where people have talked about stuff. And you know what we&#8217;re doing now? Interviews. We&#8217;re having to talk to people because we can&#8217;t find where folks have written stuff down. So to that end, about books, as I mentioned that just now, you&#8217;re working on a book called Black Design in America. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, so I&#8217;m a co-author of Black Design America, African-Americans, and African Diaspora and Graphic Design, 19th to 21st Century. My co-authors are Silas Munro and Pierre Bowins. And how this book came about is not a linear kind of trajectory of story. So back in 2020, when George Floyd was murdered and you had the protests going on, and a lot of things were sort of happening online, VCFA had started this sort of virtual programming. I believe they contacted me and asked me if I was interested in doing a lecture or something about my research. And so at the time, I want to say around that time, I can&#8217;t remember exactly, but I know at some point, me, Pierre, and Silas had created a Google Doc, and we just started populating it with our research. And some of our focus on our research was slightly different. There was some overlap, but we started this Google Doc, and I think we started it with the intent of writing a book someday.</p>
<p>So the idea was that, &#8220;Okay, we want to have this document populated to start working on the outline.&#8221; So VCFA came to me. I decided that I didn&#8217;t want to just be the only voice talking about Black design history. So I invited Pierre and Silas to also give a lecture. So they call it these micro lectures. So still had the same amount of time that I had to give my lecture, but instead of me talking for an hour or 45 minutes, we each had 15 minutes to do a micro lecture, a mini presentation about our specific research.</p>
<p>So again, around that time, I met Dr. Cheryl Miller, and she was just starting, or had already started her archive for Stanford, a Black design history archive. And somebody gave her my name. And so, I met with her about sending my work there. And something that I still feel weird about saying was that was my first time hearing about her and her work, but I&#8217;m glad I did. I&#8217;m glad that we had that opportunity to talk and connect. And now she&#8217;s a huge mentor and influence, inspiration in my life. But that conversation with her sort of gave me a little focus. So I was like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m really interested in the history of Black women in graphic design too.&#8221; So my portion of the lecture was about that.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re in the midst of the pandemic, and Silas had this idea. And so we all talked about how this information needs to get out there. I don&#8217;t know if we have time to go through the process of writing a book and getting published, and trying to do all the stuff that you have to go through, as you you&#8217;re working on one yourself. It&#8217;s a huge timeline. You don&#8217;t just do it overnight. It takes a lot of time. So Silas and his studio, that&#8217;s how they came up, and they put together the BIPOC Design History Classes, went live January of 2021. And so again, it wasn&#8217;t the intent to have the classes. And that sort of happened first. That idea, we thought, prior to the pandemic and whatnot, that we would be working on a book first. So that happened. That was the success. And so then after the chorus, then we felt like, &#8220;Okay, now we have to write this book now, because we kind of already have a structure. We have content.&#8221; But little did we know, Maurice, that it was not that easy.</p>
<p>These small classes. Okay. Yeah. There are chapters in the book, but I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s just, yeah, they&#8217;re still talking to people. There&#8217;s still more research to be done. There&#8217;s still more archives to visit. So it wasn&#8217;t just that simple to just make that transition from the series of classes, and then to make it into a book. So we&#8217;re still in the process of writing now. We have a hard, hard deadline coming up on June 1st, where we have to really turn over the manuscript. And we&#8217;re all also collaborating on the design of the book, too. So yeah, it&#8217;s been an interesting process.</p>
<p>And I think the thing that, I know for me, and I think from my co-authors as well, the thing that&#8217;s been most difficult is that it&#8217;s a design history book, but we&#8217;re not approaching it like a Meg&#8217;s book in a way, or this book came out a few years ago, it&#8217;s called Graphic Design Pioneers, or Pioneers in Design, where it&#8217;s focused on individuals. So we do talk about individual designers and sort of their impact, but it&#8217;s more about the diaspora, it&#8217;s more about Black experience in a way, and what we had to go through and deal with. It&#8217;s more about how we&#8217;ve been represented through visual culture, and who&#8217;s responsible for that and that kind of stuff. So it&#8217;s not necessarily about a clothesline of designers, although we do talk about individual people, because you can&#8217;t write a history book without acknowledging individuals. But, it&#8217;s not just about highlighting people, I guess in that way. It&#8217;s more about the different movements that happened, throughout time and throughout history.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, because I mean-</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
And we&#8217;ve been affected by it, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Because you&#8217;re, like you said, it&#8217;s set up with, it&#8217;s in the context of America during that time, and so there&#8217;s been wars, there&#8217;s been civil rights movements, there&#8217;s been other sorts of radical movements. And so, being able to talk about how Black design has been a through line with all of that in this country, we don&#8217;t learn it in school, in K through 12 schools. And based on what you&#8217;re saying, and probably from others, it&#8217;s probably not even something that&#8217;s really readily learned in colleges.</p>
<p>So having a book like this is super important, I think, not just to the design canon, but just like to American history in general. Because everything that we go through in this country has been designed in some capacity. That don&#8217;t necessarily mean that it&#8217;s been done with a pen and paper or in some visual aspect, but the systems of oppression that are in this country and many other things that sort of hold people back or push others forward, these are designed constructs. And so being able to talk about Black design in this country is super important to, I think, informing that for a lot of people. So, I&#8217;m excited to see the book when it comes out. Congratulations to you, because I know it&#8217;s a lot. I know all too well. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I mean, I think writing a book is a challenge, in and of itself, but I think history, and I think we have a special challenge in the type of history that we&#8217;re trying to bring to light, because it hasn&#8217;t been well documented or readily available. So it&#8217;s a lot of things you have to do to discover these stories. That&#8217;s definitely been a challenge. I think, one thing that I want to say I&#8217;m proud of about how we approach the writing in this book is that we sort of try to do away with &#8230; we&#8217;re being ourselves. We feel like using I, then we use I. If we want to throw in a little snarky, something that maybe a long time ago would be unorthodox for a history book, but we are just throwing it and putting it all out there. We&#8217;re not sort of concerned about our voices being the same, and we like that our voices are fluid and they&#8217;re sort of interchangeable.</p>
<p>We collaborated and wrote the introduction together, and there are parts of it, it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t even remember what I wrote. And we do have our chapters that the three of us have been responsible for, and we have contributors to certain chapters as well, but we&#8217;re not sort of concerned with the more traditional approach to this type of book. We don&#8217;t even call it a textbook. We&#8217;re not really approaching it in that same traditional way, I guess, if you will.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So you&#8217;re teaching, you&#8217;re running your own design studio, you are working on a book, you&#8217;re doing this research and your research focuses on, as we&#8217;ve talked about throughout this interview, Black people being omitted from the graphic design history canon. Given all the different spaces that you occupy, designer, educator, et cetera, what does the path forward look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I think about that a lot. I think it&#8217;s going to continue in this realm of writing and publishing, and designing. I think I like the idea of being a content generator and being the one to design that content. So I see more books around the same topic, but in different iterations. So for instance, I&#8217;m completely obsessed with Louise E. Jefferson. She is a Black woman who was one of the first art directors in the publishing industry at Friendship Press. She started working in the mid, late 1930s, and she was a designer, a calligrapher, a cartographer, an illustrator, a researcher. I mean, she was a real true renaissance woman, and she rubbed shoulders with all kinds of people during the Harlem Renaissance. But I&#8217;ve been doing research on her for a really long time. And so, I envision writing and designing a book about Louise E. Jefferson. And right now, I&#8217;ve been in touch with Friendship Press where she worked at as an art director for 20 years, and they&#8217;re interested in me writing a book about Louise and her work.</p>
<p>So those type of projects I see still continuing. The past few years have been great. The writing, the lecturing have been amazing, meeting amazing people, and have been great with giving me more opportunities to write into research. But I would like to hopefully, have more of a balance between that and my making, especially maybe even more so personal projects. I really enjoy doing small collaborations with other designers, whether it be zines or just random, creating compositions and giving files, going back and forth between digital files and things like that. Well, not really knowing what the outcome is. I think I just miss making and playing, and having fun.</p>
<p>Not that the design work that I do isn&#8217;t enjoyable, but it&#8217;s just a different type of making, I guess it&#8217;s different. You&#8217;re doing research and you&#8217;re writing. That&#8217;s a lot different than like, &#8220;Okay, I have this idea for making this thing using these materials, or even this tool or this technology. Am I making?&#8221; I&#8217;m really interested in this sort of synthesis, and analog and digital tools and how they sort of come together, and how to expand our uses in ways that they weren&#8217;t actually meant to be used. So I would like moving forward to be able to engage more, and just being a maker and not thinking about what I&#8217;m making so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, being a designer and an educator and all these things, you&#8217;ve talked now about how you want your path to go forward, but in your current work, how do you balance these different aspects? Do these different roles inform each other in some way?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, I definitely see there are so much overlap in &#8230; For a long time, I actually didn&#8217;t know how to bring all these things together, especially in the classroom because it took a while before I started teaching design history, and actually I&#8217;m not teaching it right now. I haven&#8217;t taught it in maybe three years. But I think, that doesn&#8217;t mean that I can&#8217;t still bring that into the classroom. So to me, it doesn&#8217;t matter. I don&#8217;t care that I&#8217;m not teaching design history. Whatever I&#8217;m teaching, you&#8217;re going to learn something about Black design. Some kind of way I&#8217;m going to insert my agenda, because I know that these are things that are, in part, it&#8217;s not just Black design history. I talk about queer history. I talk about other areas of design where people are marginalized or we don&#8217;t know a lot about, and I know a little something. I still try to impart that to my students, so I make sure that I&#8217;m trying to be equitable in that sense.</p>
<p>But yeah, I&#8217;m just starting to see where these roads and where these things are starting to overlap. So am I making? Now I think about, well, how could, besides designing books about Black design history or whatever, and the publishing aspect, but I start thinking about, well, what are other things that you can make that sort of has to do with your research? So I&#8217;m starting to think more about that, like timelines and things like that. So to me, the crossover is starting to happen. It&#8217;s slow and maybe not as fast as I would have liked them to be. And then I see them in the projects that I give to my students too. So it sort of reverts back to the classroom in that way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, I like that it all feeds into each other then. That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Kind of makes less work for me in a way, as opposed to try to compartmentalize everything. So for a long time, everything used to be in these separate buckets. Black design studio, freelance here is writing and lecture. But now, they&#8217;re just starting to morph together, and that has been good, and that&#8217;s how I would like things to continue in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hey, look, work smarter, not harder. I get it.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to someone out here that&#8217;s hearing your story, that&#8217;s hearing about all these different things that you&#8217;re interested in, and they want to follow in your footsteps? What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I would say, learn how to be comfortable in your voice, in your skin, and how to &#8230; I didn&#8217;t always feel comfortable being Tasheka, being authentically me, because sometimes I had moments where I didn&#8217;t want to step on people&#8217;s toes, but I noticed moments where I did do that, and I was just kind of myself and just kind of put it out there. Those have been the best experiences.</p>
<p>And I would say that we all have control. You have some kind of control over your path, and so if there&#8217;s a certain direction that you want your practice, or your craft, or your skill or whatever it is you are into to take, that you can kind of plan for. Talk to people who are doing the thing that you want to do, align yourself. Reach out to them. I know sometimes, we think and we look at people that we admire and we put them on this pedestal, but if they&#8217;re the right people, they&#8217;ll talk to you and they&#8217;re not full of themselves. And lots of times, people are more than happy to talk to you about your path, and this is especially to younger designers. Don&#8217;t be afraid to reach out to people who you admire, and have conversations with them about what they do and how they got to where they are. But yeah, I just say be bold.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Be bold.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Be bold and intentional about how you move through this world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love that. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want the next chapter of your story to be?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I do see myself still teaching. I do see myself still being at UT, and I&#8217;m hoping, my hope is that in five years, I have a couple of books under my belt by then. Maybe, I&#8217;m just going to throw it out there, Maurice. I would say at least three of them, because I have a list of projects that I&#8217;m really like. It&#8217;s kind of like these have to be done before I die. No, maybe they don&#8217;t have to be done in five years. That&#8217;s pretty ambitious of me, but I&#8217;m already working on one, so I can get the other two at least in the works by that time, that would be great.</p>
<p>I do have sort of a passion project that I&#8217;ve been sitting on on for a while. I have a collection of drawings, maybe it&#8217;s like 200 and something drawings, that I would like in five years to have their own sort of brand, where it&#8217;s a collection of, whether it&#8217;s greeting cards or home decor or apparel. Not or. I should say and. So I&#8217;ve been procrastinated on this project for a really long time, and I hope in five years that that project sort of sees the light of day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
I&#8217;m probably most active on Instagram and Facebook. So Facebook is Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton. On Instagram, it&#8217;s Blacvoice. I am on Twitter under Blacvoice, but I&#8217;m not that engaged with that platform as much. But, I&#8217;m on there and I tweet every now and then. I&#8217;m on LinkedIn, which is, you can find me under Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton. Again, that&#8217;s not a platform that I&#8217;m super engaged in, but I&#8217;m there, and you&#8217;ll probably find me multiple times under LinkedIn, but I&#8217;m there. But Instagram, I would say, it&#8217;s probably the place to see me. I&#8217;m more active there. I would hate to throw out my crappy Adobe Portfolio website. That&#8217;s just a bunch of stuff that&#8217;s thrown on there right now. But hey, why not? Blacvoicedesign.portfolio.com. That&#8217;s just something that&#8217;s there right now, just to have an online presence, until I have time to do something else with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. You and your work have been on my radar for many years, I think probably, maybe since 2015? For a while now. And it wasn&#8217;t until recently, I had spoken with Cheryl, had Cheryl on the show for 500th episode, and she sung your praises to the high heavens. And I was like, &#8220;I feel like I reached out to her before. Let me reach out again just to see if she might be interested.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Actually, you did, Maurice. I thought about that. I was actually just telling my sister right before, and I was like, I feel weird because you did reach out to me a long time ago, and I think at the time I was just not ready, and something that had nothing to do with you or the show. I love the show and listen to it, and I think that was just like, &#8220;I&#8217;m still in my boldness. I&#8217;m kind of shy too, and more of an introvert.&#8221; So I think that, yeah, it just took a while, but you did. You did, but I&#8217;m glad you reached back out again.</p>

Yeah, but I mean, I also just want to say from hearing your story and hearing about everything that you&#8217;re working on, I think it&#8217;s evident that you have a passion for design. You have a passion for honestly getting the story right, whether it&#8217;s through writing, through education, through your visual design work. I&#8217;m really excited to see and hear more from you in the future. I feel like you&#8217;re one of our bright shining stars that are really going to help represent us, as we move forward in this crazy world that we&#8217;re in right now. I feel like the work that you&#8217;re doing is really going to stand out and help showcase what Black designers are doing everywhere, so thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Tasheka Arceneaux-Sutton:</b><br>
Thanks again for having me, Maurice.</p>
