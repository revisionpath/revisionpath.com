Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>What can I say about Dr. Cheryl D. Miller that hasn&#8217;t already been said? Her groundbreaking work as a designer in the 1980s and 1990s has paved the way for Black designers in this industry. Her first-hand knowledge and experience is sought after by colleges and universities all over the country. And now, in this season of her life, she is being celebrated and awarded as a pioneering figure in the field of contemporary graphic design by AIGA, The One Club, Cooper Hewitt, IBM, and many others. Honestly, I couldn&#8217;t think of a better guest to have for this episode!</p>
<p>Cheryl and I talked about her recent work as a design educator, and she shared her newfound dedication to writing and why it&#8217;s so important to transition from oral tradition to scholarship. She also shared her interest in new tech, and spoke about mentoring younger designers who are blazing their own trails in the industry. Lastly, we explored what success looks like for her now, and she talked about what&#8217;s coming up next as her passions for art, writing, and design intersect. Sit back and enjoy this thought-provoking conversation with a true design legend.</p>
<p>(And thank you all for 500 episodes of the podcast!)</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Maurice, I am Cheryl D. Miller.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No introduction needed.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
No. No, I barely have a website, and now it&#8217;s come down to just, &#8220;Google that, okay? And I&#8217;m not the basketball player.&#8221; There are three of us, and I think there&#8217;s a psychologist and a basketball player. &#8220;Just put in Cheryl D. Miller, and that&#8217;s it.&#8221; That&#8217;s it in a nutshell. &#8220;Just Google, Cheryl D. Miller.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How is 2023 going so far?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
2023 is going really, really well. And I say that I&#8217;ve been granted much favor and grace through the pandemic, and it&#8217;s continuing. And 2023 has just expanded with new platforms, new vision, new sharing, that really all has been birthed from our pandemic season. It&#8217;s going really well. My projects&#8230; I&#8217;ve been a professor at several universities, I&#8217;m now with three. And that&#8217;s a unique experience, because everyone that&#8217;s working with me is developing this hybrid pedagogy. And I say the only thing that&#8217;s left for me to explore with this is that I&#8217;ll hologram into my classrooms next. So somebody has that figured out next. I&#8217;ll be lecturing via hologram in the Metaverse. I don&#8217;t&#8230; I would say soon.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you&#8217;re at Howard, you&#8217;re at UT Austin, ad ArtCenter, right? ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yes. All three.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yeah. And I&#8217;m crossing my fingers. I&#8217;ve been talking with University of Connecticut UConn, because it&#8217;s in my geography. I&#8217;ve wanted to do something locally. I might be with them in the fall as well. Since pandemic, I have carried four universities at a time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Light work for Cheryl Miller.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, outside of that, do you have any big goals or projects that you are working on now?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Well, yeah. I&#8217;ve dedicated myself to writing the rest of way out. I have a lot of things to write, Maurice. And I don&#8217;t want to talk too much about the writing, but I&#8217;m writing crazy. And one of the things that I do pride myself on, I do pride myself on a few things, that is, I don&#8217;t compile footnotes. My work, I make footnotes. So my revelation, my development of scholarship, I am creating conversation that I&#8217;m hoping they will be, my footnotes and the things I write, finding proof for my revelations, I&#8217;m leaving a trail of breadcrumbs. I will never write as many books as footnotes that I will leave to my scholarship.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of the things that I really, really believe in that our community, which I represent the BIPOC, indigenous community with being African-American, but a woman of many, many colors. And we must write, we must publish, but we can&#8217;t do that if we don&#8217;t have content. So my work is, I want to make sure that I leave as many footnotes and content as possible. And that doesn&#8217;t always mean that it&#8217;s in the form of a book. So I&#8217;m putting up my YouTubes, my lectures, recordings, all these things that if you study the things that I&#8217;m leaving behind, those that are really writing and researching have footnotes that they can create and compile for their books and so forth. We can&#8217;t write if we don&#8217;t have content.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I always contend is that I think Bond House is a hundred and a few years old. I&#8217;ve lived two thirds of that history. So my lived experience must be documented, which is much different than compiling footnotes out of the library. But you can&#8217;t do that if you don&#8217;t have content. I&#8217;m leaving content. Valuable, I know what&#8217;s in the card catalogs, I know what I&#8217;ve experienced, I know what I&#8217;ve lived through. I don&#8217;t compile footnotes in my work. I create them. So my lived experience, my lived history, I&#8217;ve been an eyewitness to a lot of things, I&#8217;ve known a lot of people. So writing that out in different forms, which is really my scholarship and revelation, I&#8217;m creating footnotes. And then I&#8217;m documenting those notes in places where if you&#8217;re going to really going to do the work, you&#8217;ll find Cheryl Miller. You&#8217;ll find Cheryl Miller found this out. You&#8217;re going to find Cheryl Miller&#8217;s research.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll be lucky if I get maybe three books out. But making sure the ingredients for you all to write, that&#8217;s been a big part of my work, which is&#8230; I&#8217;m in a sacred project of collecting Black graphic design history that&#8217;s in collections with Stanford University and Cooper Union Herb Lubalin Center. It&#8217;s sacred work, because I find deceased Black designers and estates. I&#8217;m working with families that know that their loved one had some crazy kind of career, and it&#8217;s all in a box in the attic or in the basement, and they don&#8217;t know what to do with that ephemeral. And usually, I show up giving them a place to have their work preserved and cataloged. So with that, that&#8217;s really important, because we can&#8217;t write a history if it&#8217;s all oral tradition and lost and dry rotting in somebody&#8217;s attic or basement.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m meeting so many families. I have a daughter, I won&#8217;t call her name. I have one I&#8217;m meeting this afternoon. I&#8217;ve worked with Sheldon Dixon&#8217;s daughter, I&#8217;ve worked with Dorothy Hayes&#8217;s niece. They all tell me these incredible stories and trust these sacred boxes that I will take care of them. And thus far, Stanford has received the concept of this without charge. That&#8217;s what they do. They bring in collections, they preserve art. I think they have MLK papers. This is what they do. And some people say, &#8220;Well, why didn&#8217;t you take it to HBCU,&#8221; and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Stanford will preserve the work freely for us.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve given everyone an invitation. Some people have wondered my motive. My motive is, &#8220;Okay. Well, you keep that stuff in your attic if you want. Or you have an opportunity for somebody to come by, pick it up, and you have a name and a catalog annotation. You have your own numbers. You don&#8217;t come underneath Cheryl Miller. This is not the umbrella. You have your own note. You have your own archive. You have your own collection. And it&#8217;s being preserved.&#8221; So we started with, I don&#8217;t know, somewhere between 40 and 60 invitations. And it is sincere, and it&#8217;s real. And I think the ones that are really moving me are the ones of estates where the designer is dead.</p>
<p>And I can&#8217;t tell you. Like my conversation with Dorothy Hayes&#8217;s niece, she says, &#8220;Thank God for you. I inherited everything. My aunt left me everything. And I haven&#8217;t had a clue what to do with it.&#8221; It&#8217;s sacred, because I listened to estate members, those who have inherited. I hear the stories of, &#8220;my dad,&#8221; &#8220;my aunt,&#8221; &#8220;Thank God it&#8217;s not going to be lost. I don&#8217;t have to toss it out. I have no idea what I was going to do with this.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s really an honor to work with the families who tell me their oral traditions and give me their boxes of goodies. And there&#8217;s all kinds of things. There are all kinds of things that we have a culture of. See, I&#8217;ve been at this since I was 17. And we have this culture of saving things in case something big happens. Okay?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
In case somebody gets discovered, or it&#8217;s hidden or lost. Who knew footnote on the back of a match cover, right? And these boxes are full of these things for a rainy day. Oh my God, you talking about the Black designers, they&#8217;re full of, &#8220;Oh my God, I got to save this for a rainy day in case&#8230; Just in case.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve had the privilege of talking to families, working with Stanford to pick up the collections, sampling the collections. They come in, they come into a holding area, they have special buildings, and it&#8217;s a process to bring these boxes in from everybody&#8217;s attic. And I&#8217;ve been telling you all, the ones that I&#8217;ve invited down to land of the living, &#8220;Open your file, open your collection.&#8221; Maurice, open your collection. You have an invitation. Open it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
So that means fill out the papers, go through it, and start it. Meaning you&#8217;ve got transcripts, you&#8217;ve got all kinds of notes from when you started this, and you remain an archivist to your collection. You don&#8217;t have to put anything new in it. You own all your rights and all of that. So it&#8217;s an honor. I&#8217;m telling all of my younger scholars, &#8220;If I&#8217;ve invited you, fill out the papers and start. You don&#8217;t have to put your current work in, because you&#8217;re working with it. Put your stuff in from college. Put your thoughts in. What did you write? Where are your diaries? That kind of thing. It&#8217;s not for me, and it&#8217;s not for you. It&#8217;s for the next generation that&#8217;ll come and needs to write about Revision Path.&#8221; Well, if Revision Path doesn&#8217;t have a record of that and hasn&#8217;t left footnotes, or you don&#8217;t pay the website bill, it&#8217;s all gone.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
It&#8217;s gone. So preserving our stories so that we have content for the next future generations to do the scholarship that&#8217;s required, that&#8217;s really important before I die. And if you get a book or two out of me, well, good. Good. You&#8217;ll get a book or two out of me. All right? They&#8217;re forthcoming. But collecting content so that we move this out of oral traditions and storytelling into scholarship and into history books, you can&#8217;t do it if you don&#8217;t have the ingredients, Maurice. So that&#8217;s a big portion of my work. And writing the most intriguing research I discover, and don&#8217;t ask me, just wait, but I have found some intriguing research that answers my primary questions for us all. So I&#8217;m writing that and working out where that will be published and how that will be published. I&#8217;m not anxious for publishing. I&#8217;m anxious to make sure that we have what&#8217;s necessary to publish.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
There&#8217;s no agenda to that. And nobody&#8217;s making any money on that, so we don&#8217;t worry about that. Yeah. Look, yeah, I have friends and foes, and friends and foes worry, &#8220;Is Cheryl Miller making anything?&#8221; Cheryl Miller&#8230; Listen, I&#8217;m waiting for the MacArthur, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, I hear you. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
I haven&#8217;t received a dime, you hear me? Not a dime for over 50 years of work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Waiting on that Genius Grant.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m waiting on the&#8230; I pray on it every day. I do, because&#8230; And these things are for the young at heart, all these awards and things. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, well, we are going to get this award, because it&#8217;s like art collecting.&#8221; I&#8217;ve learned some stuff about fine art too. &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll collect, buy low.&#8221; When they&#8217;re young, they&#8217;ve got performance. We collect and buy cheap now, because we know that they&#8217;re going to be producing for 30, 40 years. We are not going to give her that. She&#8217;s going to be good for 10 years. This should be going to glory.</p>
<p>No, but I haven&#8217;t monetized. There isn&#8217;t anything. There isn&#8217;t anything. Monetization, if you will, of this advocacy, man, I don&#8217;t even have a T-shirt. I don&#8217;t have a baseball hat, no merch, no nothing. Okay? It&#8217;s been 100% advocacy, because scholarship, I&#8217;ve learned, and in your work, statistics, the two together, the two signs of a coin, just marching and picketing, and I&#8217;m a civil rights girl. All of that brings awareness. But what has moved the needle in my life is one thesis, one document of footnotes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Cheryl Miller&#8217;s a footnote lady. And I wrote one piece, and here we are. So I believe in designers who write, I believe in scholarship. And there were years that I wondered how and why I went to seminary. I&#8217;m a theologian. And I was running the studio in New York, and Union Theological became my client. And I started part-time, and oh, that&#8217;s a whole nother story. Me in seminary is a whole nother story. But I got led into theological work. And when I got led&#8230; Theological work is not religious work.</p>
<p>So when I got into the process, I learned things that I use now. And I would say that I&#8217;ve created a genre of design social justice. Oh, you study with Delores Williams and the works and likes of Cornel West in and out of the alcoves, and James Cohen. You walk through some liberation theology, you walk through some social justice and change, pedagogy. Your tools will sharpen to slay the dragon. And then Union does not pride itself on making ministers. I mean, you can walk out and be a minister if you want with an MDF, but you are trained in dynamic levels of critical thinking, research development of scholarship in the recording of history.</p>
<p>And I got led in to be trained. And I did not need&#8230; When I wanted to go to grad school again, I went. Of course it makes sense, so you got a Master&#8217;s, go get a PhD. Well, PhD in art, unless you&#8217;re doing art history, the Master&#8217;s from Pratt was terminal for anything I needed to do, even to teach. And Union wouldn&#8217;t let me get a PhD in any form of any branch of what they had theologically, because I didn&#8217;t come up that route of a BA, a graduate degree, all of that.</p>
<p>So getting a Master&#8217;s of Divinity yet put me into what it is that is dynamic for me now. I see things that people don&#8217;t see. I answer questions that people don&#8217;t even think to answer. And that comes, and I document create footnotes and scholarship. My work is sound. And that came from being theologically trained. They train you, sharpen your knife to be able to cut prime rib with your eyes closed. And there were days like, &#8220;Why in the world am I doing this?&#8221; I&#8217;m running Cheryl Miller Design downtown, &#8220;What am I doing up here with all these intellects?&#8221; But I had learned the importance. I had leaned into my academic coach with the thesis.</p>
<p>Leslie King-Hammond, she was a PhD from Johns Hopkins. And I met her when&#8230; You know my life story, my dad died, I couldn&#8217;t go back to RSID, and I ended up with MICA. She was an adjunct African history, what, if not the first Black professor at MICA 50 some odd years ago. I was grieving, and the Dean put her in my care, put me in her care. &#8220;Here, take care of this child. She&#8217;s supposed to be in Providence. Her father died, and now she&#8217;s in Baltimore. Take care of her.&#8221; And she was a newly minted PhD, and now claimed emeritus in her own right, of course.</p>
<p>Dr. Leslie King-Hammond, she was my coach. Everybody asked me, &#8220;Cheryl, you got a mentor?&#8221; No, I had no design mentor. Nobody took interest. I&#8217;ve always had Leslie, I&#8217;ve had writing coaches. I&#8217;ve had some of the best editors to take care of my work, to take care of my writing. Leslie inspired me to be a scrum. I said, &#8220;Oh, this is more than doing a book report.&#8221; She guided me. It was rigorous. And she guided me through the infamous Pratt thesis. And we all know what that thesis has done in our lives. I was charged with Cheryl, the chair of the design department of Pratt says, &#8220;You can&#8217;t do a design project to graduate out of this program.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what he told anybody else. All I know is Anton Minasi had a studio in Lincoln Plaza, and we all had senior reviews. &#8220;What are you doing for your thesis?&#8221; We all had appointments.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never forget it. I went upstairs. He was in a loft across the street from Lincoln Center. And God rest his soul, he said, &#8220;Cheryl, we&#8217;ve talked about you. You can&#8217;t do a design project for your thesis.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m in design school, I&#8217;m in graduate school, and I can&#8217;t do a thesis. Come on.&#8221; &#8220;No.&#8221; And he gave me a charge. He said, &#8220;We want you to make a contribution to the industry.&#8221; Well, I just took a deep breath, and I knew what it meant. I knew exactly what it meant. I left his office. I got down, and this is back in the day, there was no cell phone. I went over to the&#8230; And he used to have little calling cards. I went over to the payphone on the corner, and I called Leslie. I said, &#8220;Dr. King. Pratt&#8217;s not letting me graduate with a design project. I got to write my way through this. Will you be my coach?&#8221; Thus, brought Transcending the Problems of the Black Graphic Designer to Success in the Marketplace, starting with Cheryl Miller. How about that? Starting with Cheryl Miller.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve always been a writer. People don&#8217;t know I was recruited to RISD, and I was also invited to Wellesley. So I had a choice go to RISD&#8230; When I graduated high school, after Martin Luther King was assassinated, we were in a season of reparation, and all the Ivy League schools and New England schools came down to all of the urban towns. And they came to New York, they came to Philadelphia, they came to DC. They scooped up most likely to succeed SAT scores. We all got&#8230; Everybody got invited to go to college, or at least to apply. So I was invited to RISD, and I was invited to Wellesley, English Lit and writing.</p>
<p>And I always say now, &#8220;Well, I went to RISD, ended up a writer, I got something to write about.&#8221; So I got trained. I got trained in scholarship and design and art and design, and its equalities and inequalities is my topic of conversation. So graduate degree number one gives me me something to write about. And graduate degree number two has given me the skillset to do it.</p>
<p>So we lean into that, and that&#8217;s how this has happened. Because I will tell you, what I&#8217;m doing now, the only thing that being a designer and having gone to all the design schools and all of that, just Google it. The only thing that has done for me in my work has identified a problem and gives me my content for my purpose, for what I write for. So I lean theological work as being trained as a scholar. It has equipped me in ways that design school could never.</p>
<p>And I just think about those years of, &#8220;Oh my God, what am I doing? Why am I here? Why am I here? Why am I in seminary?&#8221; And I got Cheryl Miller downtown going, I got AIGA, I got all this stuff that&#8217;s now in articles, and so forth and so on. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why I was there was to prepare me for this moment that keeps me relevant and pertinent. I write the solutions to the injustices that I see, and I create scholarship.&#8221; And the only other thing that turns the needle like that is statistics. When you back it up with your type of work, well, 2% of this and 3% of this and 4% of this, and oh, back that up with some footnotes, this, that, and the other, then it&#8217;s like you got your deposition for your court case. Short of that, it&#8217;s like a whole bunch of people complaining and making noise.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, first of all, you mentioned a couple of things I&#8217;d love to touch on. One thing that you said about Stanford and Cooper Union, which I thought was interesting, because I got a similar criticism when some of the Revision Path episodes got inducted into the Smithsonian. People were writing, and they were like, &#8220;Well, why didn&#8217;t you go to HBCU? You went to Morehouse. Why did Morehouse take it?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Well, Morehouse, first of all, I don&#8217;t think they even have an archive or something like that with design. And I already had a relationship with one of the curators at the Smithsonian.&#8221; It was a four-year sort of thing. That&#8217;s interesting though that you would get that sort of criticism about that. I mean, when you first came on Revision Path, I remember, I saw the pictures of you boxing up the stuff, and the folks from Stanford coming over and taking pictures and everything.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a weird criticism to have gotten.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s not a lot, but it sits in the back of people&#8217;s like, &#8220;Do I dare ask her?&#8221; Well, the thing about it is, preserving art costs money. It costs money, the archival process. So if someone is going to say, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to care in perpetuity for all the artwork that you bring in and make sure it&#8217;s annotated and credited and made available,&#8221; listen, you go work with that. I&#8217;m grateful. I&#8217;m grateful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, speaking of those five years or so, since you were first on Revision Path, a lot has happened. I mean, you&#8217;ve had&#8230; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen a designer have such an award tour, a victory lap, I don&#8217;t know what to call it. But you have had a number of accolades since then. Of course, you mentioned your professorships. You mentioned the collections at Stanford, at Cooper Union. There&#8217;s also your AIGA medal, your honorary doctorates, one from VCFA in 2021, one from MICA and RISD, from both of those in 2022. I mean, this has to be a tremendous validation of your work and your career. How does that make you feel?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
I&#8217;m humbled, and I&#8217;m honored. And honestly, I&#8217;m grateful that I&#8217;m alive to see it happen. Like the gospel song, I&#8217;m alive to see it happen, Maurice. And to have achieved three design awards of our industry, the Cooper Hewitt, Visionary, the AIGA. And the one that touched me in an interesting spot, and maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m a New York designer, was being inducted into, it&#8217;s the one club, but it&#8217;s the old school advertising Madison Avenue Club, being inducted into the Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m like, I have delayed, but not denied. And God&#8217;s been faithful that in the midnight hour how much work I&#8217;ve done for our community that no one knows. I&#8217;m appreciative that I&#8217;m alive, Maurice. And I&#8217;m still vibrant, so that I can use it. So all of these awards and things, I&#8217;m not retiring and I&#8217;m not expiring. I&#8217;m on the other side of this history, but it&#8217;s opening up doors for me to continue to do my work and to correct the wrongs that I see. And it&#8217;s opening doors that otherwise would&#8217;ve remained shut. So they&#8217;re honors hard, hard-earned. Someone posted that on a LinkedIn. I was just being peppered with acknowledgements and well-deserved, long overdue, but somebody said hard-earned on LinkedIn, and I said, &#8220;Glory.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the first one, I was with [inaudible 00:29:21] Debbie Allen. And if you heard my reflection remarks, receiving AIGA, the night before, she&#8217;d earned the revered award, and she was wearing red, and I decided I was going to wear red to stand with her. And these are lifetime hard-earned acknowledgements. And I always tell folks, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get it twisted. I&#8217;m not an overnight success.&#8221; Overnight success that took 50 years, Maurice. And I&#8217;m not above the law. I don&#8217;t want anybody to go through what I&#8217;ve been through. So you can&#8217;t do this if you haven&#8217;t had your own measure. You can&#8217;t work like I work if you haven&#8217;t had your own measure of challenge, pain, suffering, disappointment at the hand of this industry. And I couldn&#8217;t lay my life down like this if it hadn&#8217;t touched my door, that&#8217;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had my measure, I&#8217;m not above the law, and it&#8217;s been hard earned. And what it does now is, it gives me for those who want me. I&#8217;m on invitation only now. Invitation only is, there are a lot of things that are going on now that I&#8217;m not invited to the table. Well, I don&#8217;t have to be invited to everything, but the ones who invite me really want transformation and not performance. You don&#8217;t call me if you really don&#8217;t want to change your situation. So that&#8217;s a design model, less is more. I don&#8217;t have to be everywhere because I don&#8217;t trust everywhere to take care of my heart.</p>
<p>And with that said, every place that&#8217;s acknowledging, everyone that&#8217;s inviting me, they really want me. And for what I&#8217;ve been through, all of the horror of disappointment and rejection, why would I want to beat my head against performative projects where you just want my name? I don&#8217;t need that, Maurice. And especially on this side of history, I can get more done, I can get more done with people that want me, that really want transformation. I can get more done in one year than most people can get done in 10. You call Cheryl Miller. You want to get it done? Call Cheryl Miller. You want to look like you&#8217;re getting it done, she&#8217;s not the one. Because I&#8217;m really going to do it. So don&#8217;t call me unless you really want to hear it, you really want to do it, because I&#8217;ve always been truthful to this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I would wager your years of experience definitely has given you a sharp eye for discerning that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Oh God, yes. I can tell performative requests a mile away. It starts with the ones that don&#8217;t ask me. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, I see you. I see you. I&#8217;m not even on that distribution list. Okay. All right.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I feel like we&#8217;re sharing an inside joke with that, but I know exactly what you mean.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yeah. So it doesn&#8217;t mean I have to be everywhere, it doesn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s just that where I am are in genuine places that want growth. I shout out University of Texas Austin Design. Listen, I have to shout out to them. They had just three alumni write a letter, just three. And they&#8217;ve been transforming. They didn&#8217;t have to have board meetings, and this, that, and the other. I came for a residency and they invited me to stay and, &#8220;Would you like to create a class?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Yep, I would be honored.&#8221; You&#8217;ll have to ask them what&#8217;s it been like inviting Cheryl Miller to the faculty? Same thing. And I honor that, they really mean business. It&#8217;s a good school, it&#8217;s a great design school, heading up the ranks. And a part of it is, it&#8217;s reaching, and embracing, and being sincere to a diverse design community. And they said, Cheryl Miller, you got something you&#8217;d like to share?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;You better believe it.&#8221; And I got this crazy class that keeps me crazy busy.</p>
<p>Decolonizing graphic design from a Black perspective. It&#8217;s not Black history, Cheryl Miller&#8217;s not doing Black history, not like that. This is, I have decolonized the entire canon. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh my God.&#8221; And the point of the class is that a Black perspective is my perspective. I set the example of how to do it, how to take a one, number one, week one, and the basic canonical history goes all the way down until you get to Christmas, depending on your school. I go through each era and I show you how I decolonize the modernist perspective, but the prompts and the rehearsal back is, well, where do you come from? What&#8217;s beyond this modernist canon?</p>
<p>So this one class, I won an award from Howard with it. I&#8217;ve taught it at Roger Williams, I teach it at Howard, I teach it at University of Texas. And it&#8217;s the platform. I say platform because it&#8217;s the lectures that undergird two classes that I&#8217;m teaching at ArtCenter. And so ArtCenter, I teach communication design, I&#8217;m a co-professor, we teach publication design. But the prompts for the course, I&#8217;m a publication designer, so we&#8217;re teaching the craft of publication design, but the books that are being produced are not modernist solutions. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, so where do you come from? What are you bringing to the conversation of the book you&#8217;re designing?&#8221; And it&#8217;s intriguing. And I&#8217;ve been co-teacher, I also teach grad school there. And what I&#8217;m finding, I teach the capstone thesis graduate course, I&#8217;m a co-professor there, and I did that also at Leslie. People are asking me to teach capstone thesis. Well, who better knows how to write a thesis than Cheryl Miller? So to be a professor of thesis capstone books.</p>
<p>And I come and partner with those professors that are well oiled machines. The crit that we go through, it&#8217;s my training, how to do a thesis. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to renowned thesis, it&#8217;s crazy. One thesis, and here we are. Cheryl Miller can do a thesis, and so Cheryl Miller can teach you how to do a thesis.&#8221; I&#8217;m teaching Senior and graduate capstone thesis research and development. Now at Howard, which is exciting, is that they wanted me to teach that class. And so I think it&#8217;s two years, have I been with them two or three years? I&#8217;m not sure. Either two or three, whichever one. The first two, I&#8217;ve taught that basic class two semesters. And then they asked me, &#8220;Can you do a part two?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Apart two of the part one?&#8221;</p>
<p>And then I won an award last year, I was so honored. I got adjunct award, Phylicia Rashad, one of her first awards as Dean, for this course. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Here goes my work again.&#8221; So the course is unique and it&#8217;s transformative, and so they asked me what I do part two. And so part two at Howard is I do believe it&#8217;s one of a kind, I never say I&#8217;m the only, I will always say one of the first. But I&#8217;m teaching the history of Black graphic design at Howard University, part two of the design one that I teach in the Fall. So part one is decolonizing graphic design from a Black perspective, which is how to rework the canon base, how do we get new stories? That&#8217;s part one. And part two is strictly the history of Black graphic design. And I follow the canonical errors, but I don&#8217;t talk about any White designers at all.</p>
<p>And without a textbook, how about that? Because we&#8217;re still waiting for textbooks. And it&#8217;s the first university college, three credit class, strictly the history of Black graphic design. And so I&#8217;ve created my syllabus, I&#8217;ve got my lectures, I&#8217;ve got my content. The first class is extremely popular, and we are working with University of Texas to make it e-learning. So we prototyped it with a few professors last Summer, and I&#8217;m hoping that it will help as continued education for my colleagues. It&#8217;s inspiration of how I expand the traditional modernist canonical syllabus. And it&#8217;s a popular class, and it&#8217;s the basis for everything I&#8217;m doing. The only way that you can get the class is, either you take it from me, or we wait on University of Texas to make it. I&#8217;ve got to keep it in an academic environment, so I&#8217;m not doing it streaming and all that kind of thing. It&#8217;s going to be fully accredited and you can get a badge and all that.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re working on getting it so that people can take it. But if we&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to have one another in a class, then you&#8217;ve taken it with me. And I&#8217;m taking as many university engagements that will work with me this way, and I&#8217;m very busy during the day. Mondays are my hardest days. And inviting me to do this means that you are also working out what&#8217;s happening in design pedagogy, and curriculum, and education. So I have to shout out to Howard, UT, and ArtCenter. They are Zooming me in, and they&#8217;re working with it. So working with Canvas, and Blackboard, and Zooming me into the classroom, and these hybrid tech situations is opening up a world of knowledge-based wisdom.</p>
<p>Not only Cheryl Miller, but the pandemic has put us into this place, and I have grown in this space. And so are institutions that are willing to work that out. We&#8217;re not only but content experts from around the world, and it&#8217;s exciting. And I would say that schools should not frustrate themselves. And when we talk about looking at how we&#8217;re coming out of pandemic, listen, I tell my students, the ones that I teach at my other class at UT, is branding for diversity, I tell them all the time and the graduates preparing their portfolios and things, I said, Put some Zoom screenshots on.&#8221; These are aggressive design classes, Maurice. &#8220;And when you&#8217;re presenting, this means that you can design globally, you can be a design leader globally. You can manage how to be virtual, how to be remote, how to be global.&#8221; I said, it&#8217;s a skillset now.&#8221; We&#8217;re just not landlocked to walking around New York with black portfolios from corner to corner.</p>
<p>So Cheryl Miller has taken advantage of the pandemic and those that have heard the crying to diversify. And so these schools have wanted me and I want them, and they have blessed me and taken care of me in these years of mine now. And I have space for a couple more universities, but they have to be patient with me. Like I said, I&#8217;ve got my fingers crossed. I know that I&#8217;ve reached out. We have a campus here where I live, University of Connecticut, and so we&#8217;re looking at that. But I will work with this with whoever will work with me, and the two places that you want me. I don&#8217;t have to teach typography and this, that, and the other. I don&#8217;t have to do all that. You want me for one I do.</p>
<p>So the decolonizing of graphic design from a Black perspective, you want me to teach that. It&#8217;s a writing class, the prompts are writing. But I&#8217;ll tell you one thing that has stirred my heart is, when I teach this class of Howard, the way my scholars write the papers to the same prompts. Maurice, they help me get up every day because they are appalled that our history is not included in the main canonical story of North American graphic design. Their papers are unapologetic, and they keep me going like, &#8220;Oh my God my dear, I won&#8217;t labor through this one more year just to make sure you have a history.&#8221; So my hardest day, you asked me what&#8217;s a day like for Cheryl Miller?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take the first day, Monday is my hardest. I teach 12 hours straight. I get up, I&#8217;m online with Howard at 9:00 for three hours, I take a break. Then I move across the time zone, across the country, so I&#8217;m Eastern Standard Time. I start at 9:00, I&#8217;m with them for three hours. We lecture, we dialogue, we work out. We really work out on the content. Then my Texas class starts their time, 2:00, 3:00, and I&#8217;m there until 6:00, three hours with them. So 2:00 to 5:00 Central Time, 3:00 to 6:00 my time. I take a little break, then I head to California. There 2:00 is my 5:00, I have some transition time. Sometimes I&#8217;m early or late, depending on which way my Texas class goes. And I&#8217;m online, that&#8217;s a five hour class. My class starts all over again. My day starts all over day, all over again. It&#8217;s a five hour class that they go to at 2:00 and it&#8217;s over at 7:00.</p>
<p>And so I really have to shout out to the team there, the tech team. I Zoom in, review the work. We&#8217;re teaching publication design with a different spin. We&#8217;re working that Zoom in design, I&#8217;m telling you, it&#8217;s really an aggressive ArtCenter class for five hours. I start again. They come in fresh at 2:00, from 2:00 to 7:00, and I clock in 5:00 or 6:00, and I work until 10:00. I put in another five hours. So my family helps me, and everybody makes sure that I get water. I get water Maurice, I get water. I get a glass of water, I get a bio break, I get dinner, and I just keep moving. I keep moving. So my Mondays are my hardest things. The rest of my schedule, I write. I allow interviews, I do interviews. My door is still open. I&#8217;m here today with any popularity or notoriety because I never say no to the young designers.</p>
<p>So if you catch me, I do portfolio reviews. People want to stop by my LinkedIn Messenger, or my Instagram Messenger all the time. Ms. Miller, thank you for everything, can I talk to you? I talk to everybody, Maurice. I still do, I can&#8217;t not. I&#8217;m totally accessible all the time, which I think is the secret ingredient. I would say if there&#8217;s any secret potion to Cheryl Miller, I&#8217;ve been accessible. I don&#8217;t care who you are, you want to talk to me, I&#8217;ll talk to you. Because nobody ever wanted talk to me, Maurice, and that&#8217;s it. Nobody ever wanted to talk to me, not really. And so I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, if you want to talk to me, I&#8217;ll talk to you.&#8221; And so young scholars, young designers, I have a motto, if you see me on Instagram, or you see me on LinkedIn, and the green light is on, that means I have time to talk to you. I said &#8220;Don&#8217;t even make an appointment.</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;The way pandemic and strange diseases and everything gets us, I might not be here. If you see my green light, you better catch me right now.&#8221; I&#8217;m a right now, lady. Let&#8217;s do it, do it now. And so every day somebody text me, &#8220;Ms. Miller, can you talk?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yep, I surely can.&#8221; So I still do portfolio, I still do portfolio reviews, interviews. Everybody wants a little quote or something for their thesis. I&#8217;m still at it, and I don&#8217;t burn out within this, I&#8217;m built for this. So this is my training, so I know when to stop, I know when to rest. I do not work on the weekends, I do not work on Sundays. So to run a marathon, you have to know where to take your Gatorade breaks. And I&#8217;ve never been in a situation where I have burned out or lost my way emotionally, spiritually, break down, nothing. I&#8217;ve learned early my capacity, my boundaries. I rest a lot.</p>
<p>On Tuesdays I don&#8217;t do anything. After a Monday like that, I don&#8217;t do it. I go to the gym, leave me alone. I got a couch corner. And then I&#8217;m back up. I can get more done in two days than most people get done in two weeks. The key is rest and pacing yourself. The key is rest. Don&#8217;t go past being tired, stop. And so I learned that. Running a business in New York, client&#8217;s crazy. But I guess I learned to run the race there in New York. I learned how to take care of myself, and glory to God, I&#8217;ve got divine health, except for a left cranky knee. I&#8217;m on no medicine, nothing. Antacid it every now and again. But no pills, nothing. And so I&#8217;ve learned the art of self-care in running destiny&#8217;s journey. And my family plays a big part of that. My family plays a big part of that. I have a blessed marriage. Phil is enjoying all of this with me. We started when we were teenagers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I see the pictures on Instagram. You all are living it up.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yeah. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Cheryl, when&#8217;s the next gala award? I&#8217;ll take you. Cheryl, I&#8217;ll take you.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; So the invitation comes with Phillip. And he comes with Philip. And what&#8217;s interesting, I&#8217;ve got some interesting photos that I will release. When I went to RISD Freshman year, there was a young lady, Freshman, I don&#8217;t know what happened with her because I left out after Freshman year. But she came up there to study photography, and he came up to visit me one weekend. And we had these, Civil Rights kids, I had this bush. And she took these love affair photos of Phil and myself, and we both had these well cropped precision bushes. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Cheryl, how&#8217;d you do that?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Listen, I vinegared up my hair. Listen, I did what I had to do to be in the notice.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be left.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I worked that out. And so when we got invited to come to RISD, I said, &#8220;You know what? I&#8217;m going to entertain my community.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Let me show me post some militant Angela Davis freshman shots of Cheryl going to RISD Freshman year. And so he&#8217;s been with me the whole way, and it is a pleasure. We just did a cameo last week. A week before I woke up and I said, &#8220;RISD was inviting folks to come up to their Senior show.&#8221; And we live two hours from Providence, that&#8217;s nothing. So I said, &#8220;Phil, I want to go up to the Senior show, a cameo. Can you drive me up to Providence?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Really?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, what else are we going to do? We were just going to sit here and watch CNN and these crazy people on television.&#8221; So he says, &#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we jumped in the truck, and he took me to Providence, and saw the show, which is, oh my God, RISD design. Oh my God, just go to Instagram and look it up. Oh my God. Eye candy. If I say something is design candy, trust me, eye candy, design candy. Oh my God. Oh my God. And so it just warmed my heart. We were up there with Gary Manchin, is where the gallery is, and there&#8217;s a patio, when you walk out it overlooks Providence. And I sat there and took a familiar picture with him. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You remember when we were kids we took this picture from this venue, not knowing where life would leave us?&#8221; So he&#8217;s been with me. And the kids, it was a good decision for me to leave New York City with the practice and concentrate on them. I have good kids. Oh my God, they&#8217;re such a blessing.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s so funny, as they were coming along when if they misbehaved or anything, I would always say, &#8220;I want you to know I was a famous designer, and now I&#8217;m on this pickup line with you people.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m a famous designer, and now I&#8217;m in kindergarten.&#8221; So I chuckled with them over the course of raising them. And so now with all the awards, we have a group text and I said, &#8220;I told you I was a famous designer, but more than anything in the whole wide world, I wanted to be with you all.&#8221; So I&#8217;m a soccer mom, I&#8217;m a basketball mom, I&#8217;m a baseball mom, and never looked back about the design business. But I always wrote, the phone rang constantly. You called me, oh my God, can I have a copy of the thesis? Can I have a copy of the thesis? Can I have a copy of the thesis?</p>
<p>Oh my God, my phone has never stopped ringing because of the thesis. Now I&#8217;m with the awards, they come with me, they went to RISD with me. Got a chance, I&#8217;m so proud, they treated us so well. I&#8217;m so proud of President Crystal Williams, the 18th President of Rhode Island School of Design, first African American president of a top ranked art school. They just treated us so well, and the kids were so proud. And they go like, &#8220;Yeah mom, we know, you are a famous designer.&#8221; So what I have wanted to missed all of that for the sake of these crazy people in the industry slaying dragons? No. I have my teenage prom date is my husband, and we have two kids that have grown up to do their thing, and well, and they know that I was telling the truth. &#8220;Your mother was a famous designer and now she&#8217;s in kindergarten with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a blessing to be here. So it&#8217;s a blessing to be alive because a lot of these peers of mine, dead and gone, they&#8217;re getting these awards posthumously. That&#8217;s no fun. Thank you for the acknowledgement, but they&#8217;re dead and gone. I gave Nicole, she doesn&#8217;t have to do it anymore, but I gave her, that&#8217;s my daughter. I said, &#8220;Nicole, if anybody from New York calls you and wants to give your mother an award and I&#8217;m dead, don&#8217;t go get it unless it&#8217;s monetized. Say you had a chance to do it when she was alive and you didn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not coming to New York unless there&#8217;s money assigned to it for her estate.&#8221; So we joke about it, but I&#8217;m proud of them, they&#8217;re proud of me, and I balanced it. But I work hard. When I work, I work hard. And when I play, I play hard. So there you go. You got another question?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re everywhere, you&#8217;re super active on social media, I see you even have a collection of NFTs. I want to ask you about two things. One, where do you see the future of design with all these new technological advances? And then secondly, what impact do you think social media is going to have on design?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Okay. Well, first and foremost, a lot of what I see tomorrow that is happening today comes from the experience of something very simple. I started in this business at the age of 17, 18 years old, and they invented the Magic Marker. Listen to me carefully, I say this all the time. I entered into this business when they discovered the Magic Marker. They were eight in a box, and the name of it was Magic Marker. Up until then, which was transitional, I was trained doing layouts with guash, a wooden teeth square, and charcoal, and speed balling. If I resisted Magic Markers and said, &#8220;Oh my God, I got to have my guash.&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t be here today. I entered the television industry, when everybody interviews me about BET and all of that, and I always put these markers so people can locate time in history.</p>
<p>Gayle King, I worked in a television station, WTOP-TV, post Newsweek channel nine, was my first design job when I graduated from MICA and moved back to Washington. And Phil and I had just gotten married. Gayle King was a news trainee, news program upstairs in the news department, and Oprah was in Baltimore. And everything was done in film. And in the art department we did old school art cards in color, and the art department, we&#8217;d have to make the news graphics, the promo titling, the whole thing. And we had stands where the cameras would roll up onto the art. The station had its first animation camera was filmed.</p>
<p>And then they brought in videotape, this new, oh my god, videotape. And so what happened in that transition period in Washington, they started putting production companies around the area of the television stations, right over the key bridge. They had some colored video production houses because everything was film. So to make the 5:00 or 6:00 news, all the film had to be developed, and edited, and cut, and whatever&#8217;s going to happen. The whole place was filmed Maurice, in the New technology. So when I met Bob Johnson, he was trying to figure out BET, which you hear me in that prototype story. I love it. But he asked me would I work at the BET star and prototype TV cards? And after we&#8217;ve had this one conversation about his idea, it&#8217;s a crazy story. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is before he incorporated, he was working out the idea. And I met him in the prototype stage. So he was at the station and trying to sell this concept. And he says, &#8220;Any black designers around here?&#8221; And they send them down to me. All I can say in that conversation, I don&#8217;t want to go over that conversation because it&#8217;s all over the internet. He said, &#8220;Will you art direct my prototype show? Take the BET logo card and what we call lower thirds and all of that, because we&#8217;re going to do it in video, we&#8217;re not going to do it in film.&#8221; And so my conversation here is that, well, if I stayed there figuring out how to do lower thirds and graphics with film and didn&#8217;t learn kyron, and digital, and video, I wouldn&#8217;t be here today. Video, and that production, and those production houses that were lined up in Virginia, and if the TV stations were holding on the film, where would we be today?</p>
<p>And so I&#8217;ve always been in this transitional, one foot in and one foot out. Well, let me tell you, by the time I got to New York, just look at your history of the McIntosh. New York City, the Macintosh wiped out God knows how many businesses. I don&#8217;t do small businesses, genre of business. So the first thing that really impacted the business at large, the design industry in New York City, was they began to bundle Page Maker on HP computers. And people started, &#8220;Well, I can do my own brochure.&#8221; And I&#8217;m saying, &#8220;Oh Jesus, look at this. What&#8217;s happening?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I had Danita and [inaudible 00:59:27], you&#8217;ll see them on these award tapes. Danita Albert, one of my art directors. I said, &#8220;Listen, I got to keep up with this. Whatever this is, we got to do it.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;I bring the machines in. In other words, I sign my name to the leases, buy all the programs and stuff. I don&#8217;t have time to go figure this stuff out, go figure it out. And we got to pull up these drafting tables.&#8221; And the speedball turned into the rapidograph, into the uniball. Man, I have been through some technology.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Man, I have been through some technology. But when this Macintosh QuarkXPress one and Adobe and Photoshop, when they bundled this stuff, well they didn&#8217;t bundle, you had to buy it. The stuff was expensive and I had to buy&#8230; I had my own staff camera because I had a firm, it wasn&#8217;t freelance. I had a firm and that&#8217;s why I have logo sheets and stuff. If you didn&#8217;t have a camera, you couldn&#8217;t do this stuff.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s why I have crafted logo sheets that are flying all over because I don&#8217;t know about anybody else but Cheryl Miller had, unless you were on a job and you were freelancing and hustling stats after you worked, you know, needed a camera. There was no Adobe Illustrator skewing and all of that. This is Herb Lubalin, Tom Carnase, Tony DiSpigna crafting by hand.</p>
<p>So there were whole businesses for this. And type setting, my office was full of type catalogs. So you had type houses that only did headline type. You had type houses that did body type, you had retouch, retouching, retouchers. You had stack houses for negatives. Okay? So everything the computer did was a business inclusive of the deliveries.</p>
<p>So you had to move camera-ready art from uptown, midtown where the studios were, to the printers downtown. So the delivery services, this thing wiped out New York City. QuarkXPress, Macintosh, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. And those who were too cheap to figure it out &#8211; how to pay for all of that &#8211; took PageMaker on a HP and it went into DIY, do-it-yourself.</p>
<p>All those business folded and I just don&#8217;t mean they sea change. You know what sea change is? A sea change is different than a paradigm shift. A sea change is it&#8217;s gone. It&#8217;s gone. Never. To. Return.</p>
<p>And I saw this and I said, &#8220;Oh.&#8221; And the delivery service, AOL and the internet was flying, printing files, no more bikes running. The only thing moving now on bikes in New York City is Uber Eats.</p>
<p>I saw these businesses go if you could not keep up. And the resistance. Okay, well you can resist if you want. And listen, I used to visit Tony Dispena&#8217;s office downtown, and I was a regular go-by-and-visit.</p>
<p>And you can see, Douglas Davis has a retirement celebration documentary on Tony. You can find it on YouTube. And he shows you old school Tom Carnase, Herb Lubalin, and all of that crafting.</p>
<p>He had a well-tuned studio and you had to have equipment for that stuff. I still have that equipment, man. We had to have ellipses and drafting tools and&#8230; Oh Jesus, all that stuff by hand. I still have it all packed away. Okay, I&#8217;m looking for a museum&#8217;s installation. Cheryl Miller Design Studio still exists. Can you believe it?</p>
<p>I saw Tony&#8217;s shop pivot. He did not linger in holding onto speed balls. Speed ball pins and ink, and drafting to&#8230; See there was a process of how you did this stuff. You drew it out, you had your tissues and you had to have that camera. This thing hit New York City so fast. I went in there one day and he had a number Macintosh.</p>
<p>So what I&#8217;m sharing with you is University of Texas, I saw is starting a master&#8217;s program of AI. Next year it&#8217;s going to launch. MIT has a has a six week continue ed. Resist it if you want. Resist it and see where you&#8217;ll be. You&#8217;ll be right there with Uber Eats. You&#8217;ll be right there with Uber Eats. All right?</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve been through too much technology to know, don&#8217;t resist. Learn it. And while you&#8217;re learning it, they will figure out the copyright stuff, they will figure out the legality, they will figure out&#8230; But it&#8217;s going to do you no good if this technology doesn&#8217;t have some content experts.</p>
<p>And so I&#8217;m like, learn it and figure out your code of ethics for using it and compete. Don&#8217;t resist. Or you&#8217;ll be on your bike riding around with Uber Eats, still looking for pay stub deliveries to printers downtown.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is it. I&#8217;m curious about NFTs. I have several collections on Foundation. Phillip is doing that part of my practice. I think there&#8217;s something there. You know, got to watch out for moving west for gold, because the only ones that make gold are the ones who make the shovels. The only ones who find gold out west are those who sell the shovels. Is there a there, there? But I won&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a there, there, if I don&#8217;t jump in the game.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;ve got a Foundation collection, I&#8217;ve got a collection up now for women&#8217;s&#8230; He put up one for, there&#8217;s some women&#8217;s images. Yeah, I get it. Phil&#8217;s trained in blockchain for his business.</p>
<p>So we just keep it moving. We just keep it moving. I&#8217;m far from &#8211; well, I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m just getting started &#8211; but I&#8217;m into Cheryl Miller 2.0. Or 3.0, 4.0, whatever it is. I&#8217;m curious. I have some entree, but I haven&#8217;t had time to work it out yet. But I&#8217;m curious about teaching in the metaverse and I do not jest when I think before it&#8217;s all said and done I can hologram into some space to teach.</p>
<p>The only proof of anything that I&#8217;ve said here that it&#8217;s important. You&#8217;ll always hear me say, &#8220;Design doesn&#8217;t change. Technology does.&#8221; There&#8217;s not a thing about design that changes. Technology changes. And I&#8217;m a designer. I&#8217;m a good designer. So if I want to be left behind, I&#8217;ll go back with my magic markers.</p>
<p>I told you all of that to show you how much technology I have grown through. And I was inspired as a kid. TV was brand new. George Olden moved down to Washington DC to be with CBS when I was born. And so I grew up on art cards. And I&#8217;ve always been able to be blessed enough to be able to keep up with the technology. When I say &#8220;keep up,&#8221; is to afford the computers, to afford the programs, to afford the training.</p>
<p>And so we&#8217;re just going to keep it going and inspiring young designers to compete. So the answer to the question is Star Trek. We&#8217;re on an odyssey. I can only tell you if you don&#8217;t want to get lost, you better get your little continuing head. Or go to YouTube University. I always love going to YouTube University. They&#8217;ll teach you anything. They&#8217;ll teach anything you want to know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is so true. That&#8217;s so true.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
I also like The Verve, Terrence Moline&#8217;s group. They throw up their tips and they keep it moving in that group. So you want to learn some technology and what&#8217;s going on, they&#8217;re really working those programs and talking about mid journey and all these dolly and rainbow this.</p>
<p>But you have to show up to these things. You have to participate. You have to always be inquisitive and be excellent. Like Oprah says, you got to do the work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, you and I have talked about some young designers that you have been mentoring. You&#8217;ve talked about &#8211; or I&#8217;ve seen pictures at least I know &#8211; but you and I have talked about Simon Charway, Taeler Breathwaite.</p>
<p>How has your mentoring been going? I mean, I know you&#8217;re everywhere in terms of social media and of course like you said, you want to be on the metaverse. Like in the real world here, how&#8217;s your mentoring been going?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Oh well, listen, apples don&#8217;t fall far from the tree. Everyone that&#8217;s in my tribe, they have their gifts. I think in my life I&#8217;ve inspired them to touch their gift. And the proof that they are of my tribe, they&#8217;re all winning awards too. The family that prays together stays together. So my tribe, they&#8217;re award-winning, they&#8217;re doing the same thing.</p>
<p>They stop by every now and again and say, &#8220;Auntie&#8221; &#8211; they know, don&#8217;t call me &#8220;Abuela&#8221; or &#8220;Nana&#8221; or anything &#8211; so everybody knows to call me &#8220;Auntie.&#8221; I just speak into their lives, hope and inspiration and to identify your gift.</p>
<p>And I do have some tips Maurice, and they have been kind enough to regard some of my wisdom. And when applied, they get the same results. So they are competitive designers. I&#8217;ve got so many of them. But what you can&#8217;t do is write me and say, &#8220;Cheryl, will you be my mentor?&#8221; That&#8217;s not the way that works.</p>
<p>Usually I see a giftedness. And I think one of my favorite, you mentioned Tr√© [Seals] and Taeler. Tr√©, I love Tr√©. I love him dearly. And I love how he always remembers me. And he&#8217;s the man of the hour and he will be the man of the hour. On several occasions, his YouTubes and his articles, he will tell you that he ran into my article in 1987.</p>
<p>And most people run into the article 1987. And they find me, they do everything they can do to find me. And if you&#8217;ve gone through all that trouble to find a vintage, he said he paid 60 bucks. He found it on eBay. Somebody gave it to him, and then he found his own copy. I know I bought 200 of them, so I know 200 of them are around someplace.</p>
<p>He found it, someone gave it to him, he read it, he found me. I don&#8217;t know how he found me, but back when I was raising the kids I had a website. You could write me on the website. And he said, &#8220;Ms. Miller, I got an idea.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Mm-hmm.&#8221; I always listen. I said, &#8220;Mm-hmm, we all got ideas. Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;I found your article. I read your article. I have an idea.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Mm-hmm.&#8221; And he says, &#8220;I want to make typefaces from the lettering on Civil Rights posters.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Mm-hmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;What do you think about that? Is that a good idea, Ms. Miller? I paused. And he quotes me pretty well, I remember it like it was yesterday. I said, &#8220;Tr√©, do it now. If you don&#8217;t do it, somebody else will.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t have to tell him twice. And here we are.</p>
<p>See, this is what I tell everybody. You&#8217;re not going to be the only one, but could you try to be the first one? Try to be the first one. You&#8217;re not going to be the only one. Don&#8217;t you still go to McDonald&#8217;s and look up and say, &#8220;Can I have a Coke, please?&#8221; Well, we only have Pepsi, will you take Pepsi?&#8221; Don&#8217;t you go to FedEx and say, &#8220;Can I have a Xerox?&#8221; In the Canon machines back then.</p>
<p>First name recognition. I will never be the only one, but I&#8217;m going to be the first one, one of the first. I will never say &#8220;only.&#8221; You will always hear me say, &#8220;I&#8217;m one of the first.&#8221; Because just when I have the audacity to say I&#8217;m the first, somebody else comes up and says, &#8220;Well, I was there before you Miller.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh yeah, you were.&#8221;</p>
<p>So you got to stay humble with it. But you got to be the first one, one of the first to the application of your gift, your idea. That&#8217;s your brilliance. And so I see people now trying to do that, and they&#8217;re coming up with civil rights. And I said, &#8220;Man, don&#8217;t imitate. Don&#8217;t duplicate. Create.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taeler. Listen, that little baby can design. You hear me? She&#8217;s my youngest. I met her in Texas. Now, I don&#8217;t know the statistics, I don&#8217;t keep up with it, but she must be one of the first young black designers to have gotten as many grad school acceptances, top rank schools. And you&#8217;ll have to interview her to ask her where she got accepted.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not saying she&#8217;s the only one. I don&#8217;t know if she is the only one. She&#8217;s the only one I know out of University of Texas of Austin Design that got grad school acceptances, top rank schools and money. She&#8217;s selected prac. She&#8217;s got some intriguing work that she&#8217;s going to be doing and finishing out.</p>
<p>So you have to go interview her. And what was it like? I was one of her senior design teachers in Texas. And so, she was competitive. And boy, she was racking in those admissions and scholarships. I&#8217;m like, oh my God.</p>
<p>Simon. Oh listen, I love Simon Charway. I met Simon Charwey online. And one of the things that is so important to this work that I&#8217;m doing is that, and even there&#8217;s a segment in Dori Tunstall&#8217;s new book, Decolonizing Design. She&#8217;s got a piece in there that talks about the importance of the place to start is to understand your indigenous origins. It&#8217;s a requirement.</p>
<p>And I have researched, I had a family issue. I&#8217;m African American, but I&#8217;m also Filipino American and I&#8217;m West Indian. And I&#8217;m from DC. My backgrounds, my Zoom backgrounds, my story, everything. I&#8217;m what they call MGM: multi-generational mixed.</p>
<p>And I was raised African American. But culturally, I am Danish West Indian and I&#8217;m African American from D.C. I can hand dance. But I got four different grandparents, four different places.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m Filipino from Cavite. So I&#8217;ve got a Filipino family, I have a West Indian family, I have an African American family, and I have a Native American family. So my grandfather was white, an American Indian from Fauquier County.</p>
<p>So in this story I have one African-American grandmother, my father&#8217;s mother was African-American. And all of these people resolved at Howard and ended up in D.C. And I learned to hand dance. And that&#8217;s my story.</p>
<p>But in that richness is I&#8217;m Danish West Indies. My grandmother is indigenous Danish West Indian and Ghanaian. And my research led me to finding&#8230; Long story, but you can buy my book. Black Coral is my memoir. That work needed to be done in my life before I could even begin to do the scholarship on design.</p>
<p>And I have Ghanaian, DNA that I needed to process. I had a missing Filipino family that I needed to deal with. My mother came up looking a hundred percent Filipino on Howard&#8217;s campus. There was so much that needed to be dealt with in my origin, my heritage, my being born into this drama, that Black Coral &#8211; you can get it on Amazon &#8211; was a lifetime work that I ended up publishing in 2013. And with that, I found my tribe and origins of my Ghanaian DNA.</p>
<p>And with that comes the authenticity of my African aesthetic. You have to know the slave trade. So I know the Ghanaian slave trade is my history. The colonizers, the French and Martinique, the Dutch, the Portuguese. I know my colonizers are the Danes. And I know my history is with the Ghanaian Kings.</p>
<p>I traveled all through the West Indies for years. Census records, census projects, studied Danish census records, putting together and answering the question, &#8220;How in the world do I have Ghanaian DNA?&#8221; It&#8217;s from the slave trade.</p>
<p>And so with that, I found my tribe and where they are in Accra. I have a cousin, my great-grandmother&#8217;s nephew, who went back and became what they call &#8220;enstooled.&#8221; And he sojourned back to Ghana, and he&#8217;s a chief of the Virgin Islands. They enstooled him and met the lineage of all the tribal leaders.</p>
<p>So I have all of these records and pictures of the tribe, which is really genuine. I mean, it&#8217;s research. I&#8217;m hoping to go to Ghana. It&#8217;d be my second trip to Africa. But I&#8217;m hoping to go on a research trip to look at the decorative painting houses and things. I&#8217;m going looking at the Ghanaian aesthetic.</p>
<p>And I met Simon online. He wanted my advice on his African Design Matters project. We began a conversation on Instagram. And I saw him, and while everybody&#8217;s sleeping, I&#8217;d wake up and go to their conferences. They&#8217;re like 7, 12 hours.</p>
<p>So y&#8217;all sleeping. While y&#8217;all sleeping I&#8217;m with the Ghanaian designers and I&#8217;m hearing their agenda. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, these Pan-African brothers and sisters, they got a manifesto. And while we sleeping, they&#8217;re manifesto-ing.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I saw him interface online, working hard to integrate his research into a North American discussion. So he&#8217;s trying to meet us. He&#8217;s working with AIGA. And I was fascinated with his work because I would get up and listen to them lecture and their conferences. And I said, &#8220;Simon, the only way that you are going to break through with your research in North America, you got to get it ratified. And the only way that I know to get what you&#8217;re doing ratified is Yale.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did. I just said, &#8220;Simon, go to Yale.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how to get to Yale, but you got Professor Mafundikwa, you know him. He&#8217;ll tell you how to get to Yale. Use your network to get where you&#8217;re going.&#8221;</p>
<p>All I can tell you is that I did what I had to do in that invitation of inspiring. I never say I&#8217;m anybody&#8217;s mentor. Let him say it. I inspired him to reach, you got to ratify this work. And the only place I kind of think this fits is Yale grad school.</p>
<p>And Mafundikwa can help you. I just live in Connecticut, so I can tell you the highway and the exit to get off. Yale isn&#8217;t my school, RISD and MICA, they&#8217;re my schools. I said, &#8220;I can just tell you the exit off of A 85. But you got enough that&#8230; Try.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I didn&#8217;t even say, &#8220;Try.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Do it.&#8221; And all the way up to the last moment he got accepted, we walked him through application, acceptance, the airplane ticket. We walked him through the whole thing. And so when he got here, it was the week after, two weeks maybe he&#8217;d been here and it was summertime. He finally got here.</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;Phil, would you take me up to Yale? &#8220;I want to meet Simon.&#8221; And I asked my son and I said, &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to hit him. We got some coats around here?&#8221; He&#8217;s in New England, he&#8217;s never seen snow. He&#8217;s going to wake up and it&#8217;s going to be, &#8220;Oh my God, where are the ancestors? Where are the outfits?&#8221;</p>
<p>So the guys put together a few sweaters because he didn&#8217;t know. So he is just going to wake up and it&#8217;s going to be frigid. But you wake up and it&#8217;s freezing, you know, what you going to do? So I said, &#8220;Brothers, give me some sweaters and some coats. And Phil, can you take me to Yale?&#8221;</p>
<p>I found him and he was so grateful to meet me. And then he touched my heart. He touched my heart, Maurice. He said, &#8220;Will you take a picture with me?&#8221; I took pictures out in front of where he was living. He said, &#8220;Ms. Miller, can you take a picture with me at the Yale sign, Welcome to Yale?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, do you know where it is? He said, &#8220;No. But I got to have a picture with you standing in front of Welcome to Yale.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh my God. And Phillip was so patient. We drove around Yale&#8217;s campus looking for this one sign that Simon wanted. It&#8217;s one of these entranceway gate things to the campus, and he could not tell us on what corner, what street. And we drove all around Yale, which is a city school. Where&#8217;s the sign that says, Welcome to Yale? Well, we finally got it. He was so excited. You can see the picture on Instagram.</p>
<p>And he was so excited to meet me. We stood out and he kept taking pictures. He says, &#8220;The elders won&#8217;t believe it.&#8221; That&#8217;s what he kept saying. He says, &#8220;The elders won&#8217;t believe that I got here unless I take a picture of Welcome to Yale with you. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, Simon.&#8221;</p>
<p>It took him three years to get here. It started pandemic. He started reaching out. Everybody&#8217;s online. He found me. I started going to their conferences. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Mm, I get it. I get what you&#8217;re doing. I see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Simon is just proclaiming and got his research. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, you trying to cross over into an international space. I got it. You need to go to Yale, brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>So from inspiring him, it took three years. The process of application, getting to work together, through the interviews, through the plane ticket, through the whole thing, through &#8220;Professor Miller, can you meet me and stand in front of the sign?&#8221; And forever grateful. And he knows I have Ghanaian DNA.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m like, &#8220;For the elders, Simon, I know I don&#8217;t look Ghanaian, but trust me, I know some Ghanaian art. I know Ghana. I know I got Ghana family. I got a chief. I know my chiefs. I know my story. We are craftsmen artisans. My tribe is, if you&#8217;ve seen the decorative coffin makers, the Sowa tribe, Accra Ghana, is my tribe. And so I come natural. We&#8217;re designers, we are wood cutters, ship makers, and we build the decorative coffins of Ghana.</p>
<p>And so when I start talking to you all about some African design, I know what I&#8217;m talking about. And that&#8217;s what I mean. That&#8217;s what mean about, I got stories to tell that nobody else can tell. I got footnotes to make that nobody else can make. I&#8217;m not compiling footnotes. I&#8217;m creating these footnotes and I&#8217;m leaving them in places for somebody to write something, whatever you&#8217;re writing.</p>
<p>And Cheryl Miller said, &#8220;Well, if I said it, it&#8217;s a footnote, and it&#8217;s a research and it&#8217;s a proof.&#8221; And my DNA says, I&#8217;m Ghanaian. And Simon and I connected. The ancestors connected us. Okay, so that&#8217;s the way the drum beats.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At this stage of your career, how do you measure success? I mean, what does it look like for you now with all of the accolades and the awards and the prestige? What&#8217;s success like now?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Just remember me and acknowledge my friends. And when the ones that I&#8217;ve poured into make success on their own, that they remember. I do not talk about this famous thesis without acknowledging Dr. Leslie King Hammond. I refuse to talk about all these awards that stem from one thesis without celebrating Dr. Leslie King Hammond who was my academic coach and the scholar in my life that said, &#8220;Go get some skills.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I always tell y&#8217;all, well, when y&#8217;all have your big conferences and stuff, just make sure somebody got Ms. Miller. Is she is on the plane? Is she on the train? Somebody got her bag? Just remember me.</p>
<p>I went to AIGA, I met Teressa Moses from University of Minneapolis. We were walking out of the main theater at one of the breaks. And she and her friends were going to dinner and she turned to me and she said, &#8220;Professor Miller, you want to come and go to dinner with us?&#8221; And I kind of looked like, &#8220;Y&#8217;all don&#8217;t want me coming to dinner with y&#8217;all.&#8221; And she welcomed me. She said, &#8220;Come on, go to dinner with us. We&#8217;re skipping the rest of this. We going to go find dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that meant more to me in the world that she included me. I can&#8217;t have gone through and have the passion for our community if I haven&#8217;t been through the pit of hell with this industry. The only reason I did this is so that you all, any measure of it, you don&#8217;t have to go through anything I went through. You don&#8217;t want to go through what I went through.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t want to go through Jim Crow trying to steal my portfolio and not giving anybody a chance. I don&#8217;t want to bore you through the civil rights era. So the only reason I&#8217;m accessible at all&#8230;</p>
<p>Maurice, you don&#8217;t want to go through anything that I&#8217;ve gone through, not even a measure of it. So if there&#8217;s anything I can do to help you not go through it, I&#8217;m going to do it because I&#8217;m not above the law.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there something that you haven&#8217;t done yet that you want to do?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve thought about that. And the answer is not really. I&#8217;ve thought about, do I want a branding project? Do I want a book? Do I want&#8230;? When I really was performing and servicing, I ran hard for my clients. There were projects I really wanted and I just knocked on those doors until I found the project. I worked for my portfolio. And I did the best, the absolute best I could do in the area and the era of performance that anyone could do.</p>
<p>And I say that because I came through pre-civil rights, civil rights, and post-civil rights era. And some of these anthologies and biographies and stuff I read online, I&#8217;m not far from Thomas Miller.</p>
<p>Thomas Miller has a clip I use in my lectures. You find them on history.org. I use them in my lecture when I&#8217;m talking about corporate designers A1, number 2. Week 2, symbols.</p>
<p>I got a YouTube university in him. He&#8217;s 80 some odd years old. He just got a posthumous AIGA medal, and I just met his daughter because he won the award the same year with me. But they got a clip on history.com and he&#8217;s 82 years old. And the pain in his eyes, I felt, and I knew. He said before Gold Shark Associates, his voice was frail, but you could see it in his eyes. &#8220;I just wanted to open a little place&#8221; &#8211; he&#8217;s talking about Chicago &#8211; &#8220;And I wanted to open a little place and do little brochures and logos, but no one would patronize me.&#8221; And I saw it in his eyes.</p>
<p>And he was awarded the medal for endurance or persistence or something like that. And when they were reading his bio and his daughter was there to accept posthumously, my mind flashed back to that history.org clip. And I saw the pain in his eyes and I said, &#8220;Mr. Miller, I get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you on this other side of this story, I have so many answers to stuff I was going through when I was younger. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Where&#8217;d that come from? Why am I doing this? Why is this so difficult?&#8221; This, that, and the other.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example. I won&#8217;t call his name. Out of respect, because I don&#8217;t know whether he&#8217;s alive or not with us. But a gentleman on Dorothy Hayes&#8217; list. See, I&#8217;m young enough and old enough to be in New York at the same time and many of those on the list, I knew personally. One in particular, I won&#8217;t call his name, had a studio downtown. And he called me one.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
&#8230; I had a studio downtown, and he called me one day. I knew him personally, and he said, &#8220;Cheryl, I want to give you my studio.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What?&#8221; He says, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; He says, &#8220;I want to give you my studio.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, where you going?&#8221; He says, &#8220;I&#8217;m leaving New York.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t give me an explanation. I didn&#8217;t understand it. He said, &#8220;Have Philip run in a truck and come down and take it all out of here.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I want you to have this. In other words, maybe you can do something with this because I&#8217;m pulling out of New York,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wow. Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, Philip rented the truck, we went down and I pulled out this guy&#8217;s studio. Sometimes, depending on where I zoom, I have two plants. They were loft plants. I have one in my living room and one in my office. They&#8217;re 40, 45 years old with these plants, I took out of this gentleman&#8217;s studio. Every time I see those plants, it reminds me of how difficult it was for us to make it in New York City, and I never understood why in the world he closed his business and pulled out in New York, until I started working with the history and working with systemic racist practices, and working on my research. I said, &#8220;Oh my god, none of us were scheduled to live.&#8221; One of my favorite questions I answered, why did Milton Glaser get all the black work? That thing was driving me nuts, so Cheryl, you&#8217;re going to figure that out. Stevie Wonder, Mahalia Jackson, Hugh Masekela, all of these black&#8230; How&#8217;d he get all the black work? Dorothy Hayes&#8217;s people are hanging all around.</p>
<p>For me to realize, Cheryl, you were living in that. You were living in that era, and this is why your friend, who&#8217;s on Dorothy&#8217;s list, who was in the show, why he called you up. You&#8217;re a young kid, okay? Next likely to succeed, he&#8217;s just going to give you his stuff and pull out. I didn&#8217;t realize that till I saw his name on the list. And then, I dropped into history, and then I dropped into Jim Crow. I dropped into the cannon. I dropped in&#8230; I said, &#8220;And, now none of them could&#8230; How far could they get?&#8221; He gave me everything. Library books, equipment, chairs, drafting tables. I picked it all up. Two plants that remind me of the story. One is in my office here, it must be eight feet tall of&#8230; Yeah, one of those scheffleras, and then I have a ficus, it&#8217;s gorgeous. It&#8217;s very comfortable in my living room, about seven, eight feet tall, was in his loft.</p>
<p>See, this is the kind of stuff I live through. You&#8217;re not going to find a footnote unless I make it. I don&#8217;t have time to compile footnotes. I have time to make footnotes. I just made you a footnote. Okay? I just made your footnote. This whole conversation is a footnote. Anything I&#8217;ve, said recorded on this&#8230; You know The Chicago Style?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yeah, the whole conversation&#8217;s footnote. So, success for me, is that I lived to see it happen. I lived to see you all prosper. Congratulations on your 10 years. I listened to your anniversary.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
You&#8217;re doing what someone should have done for you, which is the key to this. You interviewed yourself. Somebody should have interviewed you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes, yes.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Maurice, tell me something about this. I don&#8217;t know. Okay, so this is at, you threw you all an anniversary party. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No. Somebody, I won&#8217;t call names, should interviewed you.&#8221; I don&#8217;t do podcasts except, I fill up a studio room. Okay? That&#8217;s not what I do. I don&#8217;t make them, but I&#8217;ll talk. Don&#8217;t invite me if you don&#8217;t want me to talk. That&#8217;s not what I do, but I know who&#8217;s doing them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
So, whoever&#8217;s listening to this one, y&#8217;all should have interviewed him and see, I&#8217;m crazy enough now I say that. Y&#8217;all should have interviewed&#8230; Maurice got to interview himself for 10 year victory. Okay, so guess what? I enjoyed your anniversary interview.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
If I had a all that design show, I would&#8217;ve interviewed you. I would&#8217;ve known to interview you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I appreciate hearing that. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
I enjoyed the story, and I enjoyed&#8230; Thank you for having me for the 500, thank you for 248. I know my number. I&#8217;m 248 and I&#8217;m in the Smithsonian. I am proud of you. Okay? Apples don&#8217;t fall far from the tree, and listen, I just shouted out, somebody with all that podcast show, needs to interview you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve been quoted as saying, &#8220;My motto is to live your life is your story, to live your life for others is your legacy. Leave a legacy.&#8221; I feel like so much of this conversation has been about your legacy. What do you want the next chapter of that to be? What do you want it to look like?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
I just have&#8230; My writing needs to be done. Please don&#8217;t ask me about it. Okay? Don&#8217;t ask me, I&#8217;m not going to tell you. I need my writing to complete, and I have investigated places I should be, I mean, I could be. There&#8217;s no should, there ain&#8217;t no should in life. Places I could be. I want to just give my gift in the right place, for the rest of my time, and Maurice, I don&#8217;t know where that is, but I can feel it. I&#8217;m doing what I&#8217;m supposed to be doing right now. I&#8217;m supposed to be leaving the footnotes, collecting the archival work from dead designer estates. I was so touched. I met Reynold Ruffin&#8217;s son. He went out to Stanford to see his father&#8217;s collection. For the heirs, to say thank you is a blessing for me. I think being someplace high and mighty would take me off course.</p>
<p>High and mighty is&#8230; What? Don&#8217;t you want to be a dean of this or this, that, and then I&#8217;ll be doing so much administration, I wouldn&#8217;t be there for you. I can&#8217;t change what I&#8217;ve been doing, I&#8217;m just going to keep doing it. I&#8217;m there for you, Maurice. I&#8217;ve always been there for you. I&#8217;m leaving footnotes. I&#8217;m there for you, and if you all remember me, I&#8217;m touched, and all of the accolades helping my visibility so I can do more of that in places that want me. There are still places that do not want me, and when they don&#8217;t want me, they don&#8217;t want us collectively, they&#8217;re still there. But, like I said when we started, &#8220;Oh, I see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, there are plenty that want me in my community, and want to share this center stage of design and experience. That&#8217;s it. I want to finish my journey, and I think I&#8217;m also in a place, where the expectancy of surprise is, I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;ll be led and where I&#8217;ll be invited, but my heart has been good about this for 50 years. So, I have an expectancy that God will reward openly, what I have done secretly, for the body of Christ in this, and for the body of designers, wherever they come from. I&#8217;m good, Maurice. I&#8217;m good. And by the way, I&#8217;m waiting on the MacArthur because&#8230; I&#8217;m waiting on the MacArthur.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That needs to be on the next chapter, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
The reason that I want it is, it will just help me finish. That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;ll help me finish. Because imagine doing all of what I&#8217;ve done with no payment. It is a heart&#8217;s desire because it will help me finish my work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up, and I know, of course, people can Google you and find you in many, many places, but are there any places in particular, that you want to point people to, so they can keep track of what&#8217;s going on with Cheryl? Cheryl Miller everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Cheryl Miller, everywhere. No, I post every&#8230; I don&#8217;t like Twitter, so you don&#8217;t find me much over there. I&#8217;m on Instagram, I&#8217;m on LinkedIn, and if you want to support the NFTs, I&#8217;m on foundation. I&#8217;m painting, I paint in the summer. That was an empty nester, right before pandemic exploration. I left DC to go paint at RISD, and life&#8217;s pivot got me sophomore year signing up for graphic design at MICA. So, I always&#8230; In the empty nesting era, right before all of this took flight again, I said, &#8220;Charles, is anything left of your painting?&#8221; I paint in the summer and I paint during the break, and I would like a good gallery. I hate all these rules and regulations, Maurice, when it comes to art and design. You got to have this, you got to have that. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh man, I can paint.&#8221; Really?</p>
<p>I can design with my eyes closed. Really? I would love a gallery to just get in relationship with me and let me just send you paintings, and you do what you do. If you ask me what I want, it&#8217;s like can&#8217;t this be a touch easier? That&#8217;s all. Because I&#8217;ll put in the hard work, man. I&#8217;ve done the work. This is not been an easy tour duty. I did all this with the design studio and my family, and all this, the advocacy, the legacy part, so I have worked some and I continue to work. So, anything that gives me grace and favor, I&#8217;m appreciative.</p>
<p>So, when the schools invite me, &#8220;Would you like a teach a class? We&#8217;ll figure out the tech.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Thank God. Thank God, University of Texas. Thank God, Howard. Thank God ArtCenter. Thank God, somebody&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;Miss Miller, we&#8217;ll make it easy for you. All you got to do is beam in with your lectures and grade and read, and do whatever you have to do. Come visit every now and again.&#8221; Just make my path a little easier. So, when I say the MacArthur, &#8220;Yeah, just make it a little easier, a gallery.&#8221; Oh, I&#8217;m not going all over New York, querying for a gallery for my paintings. Philip&#8217;s got a catalog. You want to see them? He&#8217;ll send you a catalog. You want to do business or what?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not doing that. No. You want to do business? I&#8217;ll give you some paintings. I guarantee you, you take my paintings, you&#8217;re going to make money. This is what this is about. I know how to make money in art, but I just don&#8217;t have the patience for the hurdles, and the exclusion, and what the industry does something so simple. Kids just want to draw and paint and make a living. And so, it can&#8217;t be that difficult, so if you ask me anything that will make my life easier with what God gave me to do, from the time I was a kid, would be a blessing in my life, Maurice, and you guys just remember me when you go to the conference, &#8220;Does somebody get Miss Miller? Does she have a seat?&#8221; Do like Professor Teressa, &#8220;You want to go dinner?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, I want to go dinner. I want to hear what y&#8217;all are doing the road ahead is, think about your retirement people. We can come back and talk about that. Think about it. Make decisions now, because your clients will get old with you, they won&#8217;t be there. Hiring managers are your age, they won&#8217;t be there, so you&#8217;ve got to plan that out, and we can come back and talk about that we need the industry, we need professors. Oh my god, we need professors. If I get a call once, I get a call a hundred times a day. &#8220;Cheryl Miller, you got any more Cheryl Millers?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, I got professors, associate professors that can get&#8230; Who can&#8230; Associate professors, not adjuncts, associates that can&#8230; Ready for tenure. We need them up the ranks terribly. The opportunities are there, but they&#8217;re not many of us. They&#8217;re not many of us. Silas, Pierre and Tasheka can only teach a couple places, at a time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been like, get your paperwork. Let&#8217;s get going. We need professors. Integrate that with your practice. Figure out your retirement, live happily ever after. Stand up, show up on these teams. Don&#8217;t drift back. Be outstanding and stand out, Maurice. I&#8217;ll say that one again. Be outstanding and stand out from the rest. When you can, make your gift the first. You won&#8217;t be the only one, but you&#8217;ll be most memorable. Don&#8217;t imitate. Don&#8217;t duplicate. Create. Prosper the God-given gifts in you, and don&#8217;t take no for an answer. Sometimes you got to wait. Have some patience. God knows if I can wait 50 years for the wind of change, y&#8217;all can wait 50 weeks. You can wait 50 days. I still meet people today. Cheryl Miller, I didn&#8217;t know anything about it. I said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m sorry you didn&#8217;t read the article 35, 40 years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>You know why they didn&#8217;t read it? Because the books used to come in the mail, and if you didn&#8217;t see your picture in the front of the book with an award, you toss it to the side. But, I was right there writing. The article&#8217;s in the back of the book, and I shout out and thank everybody, and always thank. Thank you, thank you, thank you to my allies in this season. Both Ellen Lupton and Brian Collins have been a blessing for me, and I just want to make sure that I thank them openly and I thank them for their favor and their grace. I always thank everybody who&#8217;s helped me. Michelle Spellman, I acknowledge her in my lectures, she&#8217;s first black female art director, Time Inc. I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing. No Sports Illustrated. I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing. She gave me my first job for Time Inc, and next thing I knew Time Inc. Corporate was my client, and I had Cheryl Miller Design.</p>
<p>I thanked Michelle. I always thank Fo [Wilson]. Yeah, 50 years, Hip Hop graphics. Listen, Fo said Cheryl Miller to McDonald&#8217;s, one of the best jobs I had while she was art director of YSB. We helped each other. I was in seminary and Michele Washington remembered me, when they were doing those design before. They weren&#8217;t giving us any design medals and stuff, she wrote one of those profiles for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, Design Journeys. I remember that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yeah. So, we helped each other, we did what we could. I gave everybody work. Then, I&#8217;ve had some wonderful allies in this season. Professor Sansone, and all of my professors at UT, Doreen Lorenzo, and Kate Canales, and Kelsey Gray, and Sean Adams, and Bruce&#8230; I mean, I&#8217;m thanking everybody like I&#8217;m getting an Emmy here. When I met you with former president, Julie [inaudible 01:46:21], she said, &#8220;Come on out of here. Get out of the woods. I&#8217;m going to take you to Chicago.&#8221; Regina Roberts came all the way, and beautiful allies, brought me all the way, came all the way over here, get my boxes. Philip said, &#8220;Cheryl, how many times we got to move these boxes?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Until I figure out where to go.&#8221; I saved everything. The whole Cheryl Miller, I don&#8217;t dare put up all my work on the internet, y&#8217;all got a sample.</p>
<p>So many people, all of the awards people, all of the Smithsonian, and there&#8217;s so many people to thank, and so many people to remember, my allies and everybody who&#8217;s asked me for lectures, there&#8217;s so many people to thank. And so, I&#8217;ve had grace, in spite of, so expect the grace. Expect favor. Live well and life will be well to you. This is the last time we going to have this conversation. I want to shout out to Pratt. We&#8217;re keynoting their graduation and they&#8217;re honoring me with&#8230; I guess they&#8217;ll be announcing it soon, by April. I&#8217;m sure that by the time this runs, it&#8217;ll be announced. Yeah, they&#8217;re giving me an honorary degree. I&#8217;ll be keynoting at Radio City musical, for their graduation. And so, Maurice, it&#8217;s really simple. Whoever will love me, well, I will love well back, and when you love me, you love my community I represent.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, amen to that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
And, I love you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Amen to that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
I love you and I&#8217;m proud of you. Congratulations for your 10 years. You&#8217;ve been a blessing for me. I wish you well in all of your endeavors, and all of your segues, victories, transitions, your writing, the podcast, God will smile on you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
We keep doing this and I&#8217;m honored to be number 500. I know for sure this will be, unless we&#8217;re doing this again, and I&#8217;m a hundred years old and you&#8217;re like&#8230; I expect a long life, but I don&#8217;t expect that you&#8217;ll interview me again, but maybe so. We don&#8217;t ever know. We don&#8217;t know yet. And so, I&#8217;m just listening. I think there&#8217;s some places where I&#8217;m yet to arrive. God doesn&#8217;t show it to you all, and He doesn&#8217;t give you everything that you want. When your gift, you get sent and you get placed. So, each and every day I pray, &#8220;Okay, lead me, guide me what you want me to do next.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think there are other schools, I think there are other projects. I think there are other kids and scholars, and I&#8217;m proud of everyone&#8217;s life that I&#8217;ve touched. I&#8217;m grateful for all my allies in this season, who&#8217;ve helped me, and they&#8217;ve helped me greatly. For everyone who&#8217;s supported me, over the years, clients and the stories are truthful. I pray a special prayer that God would thank you, because I can&#8217;t thank you better than when the God can touch your life and say, &#8220;Oh, well, that thank you came from Cheryl Miller. She prays for you.&#8221; So, that&#8217;s what you want. You want God to thank you for how your kindness and open door to me has blessed me.</p>
<p>Once again, I want to thank you for always supporting me and having interest in everything that I&#8217;ve been doing, and I&#8217;ve been thanking everybody, and I just want to make sure that I shout out to my universities that have accepted me and brought me into my new work. And, of course, we mentioned University of Texas, Austin Design with Doreen Lorenzo and Kate Canales, and everybody in Austin there, has been great to have me and my new scholarship. It all really started rolling with Nikki Juen at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, and Professor Kristina Sansone at Lesley Art and Design in Boston, and put me on the faculty there. I want to shout out and thank Bartley and Howard University, I was blessed to win an award for my new class there, and that&#8217;s been exciting and a real, real big shout out to ArtCenter, and Sean Adams had a vision to have me join out there.</p>
<p>And so, it&#8217;s crazy, but this new hybrid scenario is allowing me to reach all of the universities that would have me, and so I&#8217;m very, very grateful and thankful for that. Everyone that nominated me for all these great awards, Ashley over at AIGA and everyone at Cooper Hewitt and the One Club. Oh my goodness, everybody has just blessed me, all my friends at the Poster House keep remembering me. A special shout out to, not sure if I mentioned before, Regina Roberts over at Stanford has been helping me with our collections and making sure all those footnotes are in place for the next generation. And, the universities that have honored me with our honorary awards. And keynote speaking. I&#8217;m going to shout out to Vermont College of Fine Arts, MICA, RISD and I&#8217;m going to be keynote and receiving honorary from Pratt for this graduation 2023.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve gotten everybody, there&#8217;s so many people to thank over the course of a 50-year career, and especially no one had to remember me, Maurice, and pull me out of the card catalog in this season of Renaissance and resurrection and restoration, or whatever we want to talk about Cheryl D. Miller 2.0 since the pandemic, it&#8217;s really been a blessing. Everyone who has had me write, speak, lecture, teach something, it&#8217;s all keeping me alive, and we&#8217;re moving. Especially you, Maurice, I&#8217;m so, so appreciative of everything that you&#8217;ve done and from remembering me from the very first, back when you were doing South by Southwest presentation, you came looking for me. I was definitely in the card catalogs of the decimal Dewey system and you brought me forward, so there&#8217;ve been a lot of people that have been instrumental. I don&#8217;t want to forget anybody, and if I have, please trust me, I remember every good will and wish toward me. I just am appreciative of the path of revision and vision that you have given us. I just want to say thank you.</p>
<p>And so, one more shout out to ArtCenter and Howard and UT, I&#8217;m just really grateful for the universities that are having me. Of course, all the clients that put up with me, and my designers that put up with me over the years, it&#8217;s been really&#8230; What a crazy journey. But, I&#8217;m living to see it happen, and in the next generation of those who seek this to embrace this career. So Maurice, thank you. God bless you, God keep you and keep revisioning the past, over and over again for us, and thank you. This is your buddy, Cheryl on [inaudible 01:53:37], and we thank you. So, with that, congratulations. Thank you for having me. Once again, you have my permission to make this one collectible. How about that?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Thank you for&#8230; I mean, I don&#8217;t really even know where to start. Just thank you for being you, for being an example, for being a trailblazer, for continuing to write and rewrite the canon, to show that we are here, we&#8217;ve done the work, we&#8217;ve existed, and we can continue to be here, and we have you as an example to show for that. So, thank you. Thank you again for coming on the show, for our 500th episode. It was a pleasure. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Cheryl D. Miller:</b><br>
Yes, Maurice. To everybody, just keep going and compete. Just compete. That&#8217;s all I have to say. And, don&#8217;t shy back. You have to be in it to win it, so go for it. There&#8217;s so many more now. There were only a few of us back in the day, Maurice. But now, the tribe is an army. All right? And so, we can move forward mightily, and I pray that blessing upon us all, and don&#8217;t resist AI, go get your certificate. Okay, my love.</p>

<p>Agencies play a critical role in ensuring that the next generation of creatives reflects the world we live in, and Rudy Manning takes that responsibility very seriously. As the co-founder and chief creative officer of <a href="https://pastilla.co/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Pastilla Inc.</a>, he is dedicated to not only providing services for a diverse range of clients, but also for making opportunities to get more people of color working in the design.</p>
<p>Rudy starts off talking more about Pastilla, and showing the ins and outs of what it takes to operate an agency. He also spoke about growing up in Panama and Germany before coming to the U.S., shared some stories of his early days designing DVD magazines, and how the combination of these experiences brought him to founding his own creative agency. Rudy also talked about teaching the next generation of designers at ArtCenter, being board president at <a href="https://www.artdivision.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Art Division</a>, and gave some great advice for anyone looking to start their own agency one day. Rudy&#8217;s passion for all things design and his drive to help uplift others truly makes him a design leader worth following!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
My name is Rudy Manning and I am a creative director. My title is the Chief Creative Officer for an agency that I started about 18 years ago or 19 years ago now, called Pastilla based out of Pasadena or Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, that&#8217;s pretty good. So you&#8217;re coming up on 20 years of that.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, I know. We&#8217;re getting excited. We put a big event together for everybody who&#8217;s been a part of this journey. So yeah, it&#8217;s a big milestone.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It feels like the milestones sneak up on you. You&#8217;re so busy sometimes in the work and doing it that you look up and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wait a minute, I&#8217;ve been doing this for 20 years?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m telling you, it goes by&#8230; When you&#8217;re in it, sometimes it feels like it&#8217;s treading along, but then you look back and you&#8217;re like, wow, awesome. Yeah. Super grateful to still be in business and have it continue to thrive. So super excited.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2023 been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Really, really good. There was a lot of things shifted in the agency about five years ago. I merged with another agency that was one of our partners. They were doing a lot of development for us and probably for most of the time at the agency, up to that point, they were the main development partner for anything we did that was digital base. We decided after a long relationship to just come together, it just made sense. And that really shifted the trajectory of the agency the past five years. We&#8217;ve matured, we&#8217;ve grown substantially in that time. Really, really just have a little bit more of a focus.</p>
<p>2023 is, I think, really excited because, although a lot of things in the economy are uncertain, I feel like we&#8217;ve done some pretty smart things that have kept us afloat and kept us strong. Definitely the kind of work that we do in those years of the pandemic really ended up helping out for us because we&#8217;re a creative branding agency, really branding led, but we do a lot of digital products. So obviously there was a lot of investment in things digital. So that really helped out and now we&#8217;re positioned for a very steady growth of 2023. So, so far so good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, were there any big goals that you wanted to accomplish this year?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Well, last year one of the big goals we had was growth. I&#8217;m going to go a little bit into agency talk. This might go a little bit deep, but I think if somebody&#8217;s out there listening and has an agency, I think this is really important. Every year is different. Sometimes it&#8217;s like revenue, sometimes it&#8217;s profit, sometimes it might be people. There&#8217;s the goal, growing. And last year it was a lot about refining the team, making sure that the people who we had were working well together. Not only just processes, but the personalities and the right roles and the right balance of folks that really can help continue to lead and build the company and service our clients.</p>
<p>So that was a really huge goal and we owe huge testament to a lot of people in our agency, but definitely our HR team and we really refined a team. At the end we started off the year now knowing that the staff that we have is solid, they&#8217;re working together, a really well oiled machine and I feel like we&#8217;ve achieved that last year and this year now it&#8217;s becoming about really working. I&#8217;m calling the title for this year, nurture the details, which is about going a little deeper into the relationships that we have with our clients and not just servicing them, but really understanding their needs from a full 360 to be able to deliver as much value as we can. Not necessarily growth from growing clients, but growing the clients that we have currently.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s really what I&#8217;m focused on for this year, and so far so good. We&#8217;ve already in the first two months have been able to do that pretty well. So I&#8217;m looking to continue to foster that in the team. And from the creative, the same thing. Being able to push the creative further and further, be able to deliver the best at every single thing that the client sees and making sure that they continue to stay with us, continue to come back and continue to see us as a strong partner to be able to service them in other things that maybe they didn&#8217;t even think we can help them with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s jump more into talking about Pastilla. You&#8217;re the co-founder and chief creative officer. You&#8217;ve already given a little bit of background about the team and the services and stuff. What really sets Pastilla apart from other agencies?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny, when I was in school, in design school, I graduated and a lot of people during that time were like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to jump into web. I&#8217;m going to work in motion. I&#8217;m going to work in print.&#8221; But really at that time, you had to know a little bit of everything, but I really liked having to cross-discipline position and I was working everything from packaging to environmental to doing film titles, commercials, apps, even back in 2003, 2004. I&#8217;ve always been in this cross sector of creative where it didn&#8217;t matter what discipline it was.</p>
<p>Now, that&#8217;s been really fun. A really, really exciting 20 years. I&#8217;ve learned a lot. It wasn&#8217;t easy because you do have to, to continue to sell, there is a certain pattern and you want agencies or you want clients to have that one thing that they think about you. And when you&#8217;re working and building the agency, it&#8217;s really tough to figure that out because you&#8217;re just taking things as it comes. And especially if I&#8217;m the kind of person that&#8217;s excited about a lot of different things, it&#8217;s been tough. It was really tough, I would say the first 12, 13 years. We were doing motion one year and the next year we&#8217;re doing the launch campaign for Microsoft Surface Tablet in 2012 or &#8217;13. So very, very different projects, but exciting nonetheless. But made it difficult because when you tell the story of who your agency is, you really want to have the repeat factor. Even if it&#8217;s a different story and positioning, you do want to have this focus. So that was tough.</p>
<p>Around that time, 2013, I decided what we really do well and what I really like to do the most out of everything we did was branding and really looking at every client that came to us from a branding perspective, whether it was a brand new client where it&#8217;s a brand new company where you&#8217;re doing strategy, naming, identity system, and then executing that, which makes sense because we had that full service. That was something that finally, I would say at that time, we were able to start really honing down who we are as a branding agency. But at the same time, what made it interesting is we also had a deep understanding of how to put that company or that brand in action. So how it applies in digital, how it applies in motion, how it applies in print, and being able to do the full picture after we do the identity system.</p>
<p>It took a long time to do that and to get to that point, but I feel like that was one huge defining point at refining who we are, that made us stand out, at least let&#8217;s say in 2013 to 2016 or so. Then, I would say around that time, 2016, I started feeling like I wanted to do work that mattered a little bit more. Not that any of the work that we did didn&#8217;t matter, but something was in me that felt like I want to be able to be a part of the communication and deliver creative to projects and initiatives that had some kind of social impact through some different situations.</p>
<p>I ended up learning a little bit about the government work and how to approach it. It took a very long time, but I really got interested in being able to service the same kind of level of high end creative, the same kind of level of thinking and focus that we give to the private sector clients, but give it to more civic, public or nonprofit clients. And I would say it was specifically public sector. So we won one project, for the city of Pasadena we did a anti-tobacco campaign. That went really, really well and that&#8217;s when I got the bug of like, &#8220;Wow, I really like this idea of designing for the people directly, designing for communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now looking at eight years later or so, just last year rebranded&#8230; Well, this year, we actually just finished rebranding a city, the identity, the strategy and we&#8217;re going to continue to serve them. It was a really amazing experience to be able to put all that we&#8217;ve learned this first 18 years into branding a city. One of the reasons they picked us was because we weren&#8217;t a typical public sector type of agency. They said it right in the first town hall that they had. They chose us because we were not the typical public agency that spoke government and so forth. They felt like we were a little bit more on the ground and had a fresh perspective. We commend them for that as well because I know that often we lose because there&#8217;s other agencies that know how to speak that.</p>
<p>So I would say we have this well-rounded full service agency that&#8217;s branding focused, most of our clients come through us for that. And that we&#8217;re civic minded, civic social impact minded. We do things in sustainability and so forth. And sometimes some private sector clients come to us because of that. We also have that passion for doing work that matters and that directly affects people and communities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I would have to imagine that city branding project was a lot of fun. When you think about the scope of what that entails, it&#8217;s not just, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re going to make a logo and a style guide.&#8221; There&#8217;s so much that has to go into that level of branding because a city is more than just a company, it&#8217;s more than just a brand. It&#8217;s not a society but I say that to say that the scope of something like that is immense.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. We underestimated some parts of it. The discovery and the research that we had to do, especially because we&#8217;re not based in the city. It was the city of Corona and we&#8217;re maybe about an hour away from them. One of the comments in the beginning when they first introduced us to the city council was like, &#8220;Oh, why didn&#8217;t you guys go with a company that was in the city of Corona, or from the city?&#8221; We had to invest a lot of time into proving that an outsider, an agency that comes can have a fresh perspective, can do just as good if not a better job than somebody who&#8217;s really close to the city.</p>
<p>So the discovery and the strategy was a lot of work, a lot of workshops, a lot of meetings, a lot of popups that we had to do to get engagement and really validate the messaging and the final outcome of the identity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s tough to get right, because so many people that are in a city, it&#8217;s not just business, it&#8217;s not just commerce, it&#8217;s everyday citizens. It&#8217;s so so hard to get right. I guess the reason I&#8217;m speaking about this so passionately is because I&#8217;m in Atlanta and we were known for a spectacularly bad city branding campaign back in the early to mid 2000s. I happened to be working in the city, working in tourism. So I got to see it unfold from the inside about how bad it was. But yeah, we were known for a spectacularly bad branding campaign called Brand Atlanta. I was working in the city in tourism at the time, and just seeing it unfold from the inside was horrible because you could tell that the people that were putting this together, and I think they got a local agency to do it, but what can happen, and I think you probably know this too, is that the client can get so held up in what their vision of it should be, that it&#8217;s hard for the agency to do the necessary research and work that needs to happen in order to really provide good work.</p>
<p>And so basically we just had all these suits that were in our tourism board. There were like, &#8220;Atlanta is this,&#8221; and as someone who&#8230; I&#8217;m not from Atlanta, but I&#8217;ve lived in Atlanta, I&#8217;m from the South. I was like, &#8220;Atlanta is so much more than these things that you think it is.&#8221; They thought Atlanta was the zoo and the baseball team and all the very family friendly, squeaky clean sort of stuff. But I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Atlanta is also hip hop and strip clubs, it&#8217;s all of that. And you&#8217;re trying to sanitize this vision of what the city is, because at the time they were trying to get more conferences to come to the city, which was the main point of them doing the rebrand is to make the city seem more appealing.</p>
<p>They did it. They rolled it out. We had, I think it happened at a Falcons game where they did the whole Brand Atlanta rollout. They had the symphony and they wrote this song. They had this song that was written with T.I. and Usher and it was all horrible. People hated it. It was so bad. It was so bad. There are very little, if any traces of it still around in the city because they quickly covered it up after it went out. So city branding is tough. It&#8217;s so tough to get right.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
That would be our worst nightmare. And actually, there&#8217;s one project that we had pitched a couple years ago. I can&#8217;t name the university, but we came in very close to winning it. We ended up losing it to another company who had a lot of experience in higher ed. One of the main things I pitched that got us very close is I said, &#8220;This is not a logo identity we&#8217;re doing. We&#8217;re really doing a political campaign in a sense. We have to approach everything we do to get people, the students, the instructors, to believe in the direction before we even go in that direction. So we have to really understand what it is that the students and the faculty need and what do they believe to then be able to communicate an identity system.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what happened is at some point it seemed like they jumped the gun. We didn&#8217;t get it. Three years later, they end up reaching back to us saying, &#8220;This was a horrible experience what happened to us, everybody hated the logo. There was political nightmare, PR nightmare, communication nightmare in the school.&#8221; And obviously it was too late at that point, but they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Definitely we should have gone by you.&#8221; There&#8217;s literally an email saying, &#8220;We regret going with this other agency. We should have gone by you because the direction that you were pitching was exactly what we needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the ideas was the students at the school, the graphic design students, they need to be a part of this identity for the school. They need to have their hands in it in some kind of way. All of that just really gets people to feel that this came from within. It has to feel like that with anything like that. If not, it&#8217;s really, really hard. So I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s crazy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:18:34]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When new projects come in with you sitting at the head of the company, do you get to work hands-on with them?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
I do. We&#8217;re about 35 or so people with some contractors definitely goes up to maybe even close to 50. The design team, we&#8217;re pretty nimble. So I&#8217;m the creative director. We have an art director and we have a few graphic designers and UX designers and so forth. But I still am, as the acting creative director, at least maybe for the next couple years, I am potentially looking to bring in a creative director.</p>
<p>So that means that basically I don&#8217;t design, but I review. I give critiques. I give from either my art director or my lead designers, senior designers. They will go and do the work themselves and then come back, present to me. I give them feedback, I give my thoughts. They present to me, I give them feedback on how to present, what kinds of things to say. And every now and then I&#8217;ll have to present. But seldom, less and less. I think my team&#8217;s gotten to the point where they&#8217;re pretty good at understanding my vision and so forth.</p>
<p>Sometimes in the beginning I set some parameters, I would say, around the direction of where we should go based off the strategy or whatever it may be. But often they&#8217;ll come to me with some ideas and then I&#8217;ll take those ideas and give them some feedback on refining them, even if it&#8217;s just general higher level concepts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you&#8217;re not, like you said, working hands on but you&#8217;re still pretty close to the project in that you get to see it unfold, kind of step by step.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I do a lot of other things. My partner now rents most of the operations, but I&#8217;m still really responsible for a lot of the business development, the relationship of our clients and overseeing all the accounts, not just from the creative, but managing the entire perspective of the direction of that client.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does a regular day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Lot of calls. I think these days, we&#8217;ve had an office for probably the first 15 years of our company and just after we merged with Kremsa, is the name of the company that we merged with. Just after that, we decided, you know what? Let&#8217;s go remote for a little bit. We were trying to figure out how the two companies were going to come together. We did that for about a year, year and a half. We started looking for an office. Then the pandemic hit. So it was frustrating for me working remote, but I literally learned to adapt. We all have adapted pretty well for it. Sometimes we obviously meet, and I say that because one of the drawbacks now is on a lot of meetings because we have to force those kind of interactions between people. So that means my days are pretty booked up with calls.</p>
<p>I would probably say I spend about at least five to six hours a day on calls. I would say half of it is internal things, whether it be operational meetings or looking at something we&#8217;re doing internally to market ourselves or project stuff, account managers presenting to me where we&#8217;re at with the client, the margins, what new projects are coming along and so forth. So I do that and then probably 10, 20% of the day might be some creative meeting that I have with the team where they&#8217;re presenting some ideas or so forth. But most of it&#8217;s operational business meetings. Yeah, I would say that&#8217;s basically my whole entire day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Business development&#8217;s important though, because you got to bring them in, you got to bring the client work in.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. It&#8217;s always been something I&#8217;ve done forever, just naturally, it&#8217;s been something that I&#8217;ve always just somehow understood. So it&#8217;s the thing that probably, from a financial point of view, that&#8217;s the biggest value right now that I bring to the company is the business development. Most of the projects come through something of my relationship or some doing of our content or so forth. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is it tough balancing the creative and the business sides of running an agency?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
It is, and it&#8217;s getting harder and harder because I talk about how we&#8217;re now remote and how many hours I&#8217;m on calls, because so much of it is that higher level strategic thinking of the business, the client, operations, who do we need to hire? What&#8217;s happening with this hire? Do we need to bring in another person for this? Hey, there&#8217;s an issue with this client, this is what we need to do, or here&#8217;s some cool things that we can do or new projects, pitches, proposals. All of that really takes up most of my time.</p>
<p>So staying creative is really, really important for me. I try to do that as much as I can. I sort of time box it. So one of the things, we just moved into a new house a year and a half ago, two years ago. So I&#8217;ve had a lot of fun just doing interior design and designing the space and just remodeling the house and not just hands on, but the actual design part of it. So I&#8217;ve had a lot of fun doing that and bringing my design into that. It&#8217;s been something I&#8217;ve been enjoying. At least right now, that&#8217;s definitely a way I&#8217;m getting my creative output. Also teaching is really great as well. Hearing students work and giving feedback at that level as well, that also feeds me tremendously.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I want to talk more about your teaching later, but before we get to that, I want to learn more about you. I want to learn about how you got to where you are now, where you&#8217;re running an agency and you&#8217;ve got it staffed with all these designers and things like that. So tell me about where you grew up. Are you originally from California?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
No, actually I&#8217;m Panameno. I was born in Panama. Yeah, I came here. We immigrated with my parents here when I was seven or eight years old. We came here. My dad joined the Army. He thought this is probably the best way for us to make a living for him and provide for us. Immediately after that, I would say about a year after we moved here, he got shipped to Germany. So I was basically, that&#8217;s where I learned English was in Germany.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
I only spoke Spanish, so I was there for about almost four years, I think. Then we came back to United States when I was 11. We were basically in Los Angeles, and then we moved to Rialto. So basically from 11, 12 up, I&#8217;ve been in Southern California area. I went to high school in Redlands. After my mom and dad divorced, my mom moved towards that area and that&#8217;s where actually I ended up meeting somebody who gave me a little bit of a hint about me wanting to maybe study graphic design at the high school. So I went to Redlands High School and then from there I graduated, went to Cal Poly Pomona for a couple years, and then ended up transferring to ArtCenter, which is what brought me to Pasadena.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, back before you went to Cal Poly Pomona and everything, as you were traveling between these different countries as a kid and then eventually settling in California, did you always have an interest in design and creativity and stuff like that?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
I think it was mainly just drawing. I loved to draw since I was a little kid. My brother as well. We both used to just draw together, and he&#8217;s a graphic designer too. My dad studied architecture for a little bit in Panama, but he&#8217;s always drawn and painted his whole life. We have a pretty artistic family. So my dad, since we were little, always was drawing and we&#8217;d copy his drawings and he&#8217;d go one by one and then we&#8217;d follow what he was doing. We&#8217;d do that all the time, in front of the TV. We&#8217;d sit down and he&#8217;d be talking, he&#8217;d be showing us what to do. Did that for many years and my mom, a little bit after, my mom and dad divorced, my mom started a business. So then got to see that part of it. She&#8217;s been really successful at it.</p>
<p>So got to see the benefits of owning your own company and your own business and what kind of freedom that gives you, and the satisfaction and seeing her in it, that drove that part of it as well. So I think those two things combined is what got me the framework of thinking of building an agency.</p>
<p>I would say, I remember I stopped drawing at 11 or 12 years old. I don&#8217;t know why.I think I just ended up playing baseball. My focus was different and I was just playing baseball all the time. And then one day, I don&#8217;t know why, I just remember, I was 14 and I was just like, &#8220;You know what? Let me draw a baseball player.&#8221; That&#8217;s what I loved. And I remember I drew Orel Hershiser. I had it in my art class and I took it to school. I remember that feeling of everybody like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, you drew this? How did you&#8230;&#8221; That reaction, you kind of had a similar background as an artist, you&#8217;re like, man, there&#8217;s this feedback that you get that&#8217;s a little bit of this high. I&#8217;ll never forget that. So I just kept on drawing and then that went to painting, and then I was just taking art and painting classes. And eventually that took over my passion for baseball, and that&#8217;s all I wanted to do, was draw on paint sports figures.</p>
<p>I wanted to be like Leroy Neiman, who&#8217;s a very famous sports fine artist painter. And then until I was in one of my art classes, I think I was a junior or something, it was a student in there who was a really good artist who was going to graduate. And I asked him, &#8220;Hey, what are you going to do after school?&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to go to PCC, Pasadena City College, and then I&#8217;m going to transfer to ArtCenter and study graphic design.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s that?&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;It&#8217;s like doing things for MTV.&#8221; And I remember going, &#8220;Dang.&#8221; That was the days of MTV, MTV, the real MTV. And I was like, &#8220;That is amazing. Graphics for MTV.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t even know the word graphics actually. I just thought art for TV that people could see. So I remember that, and that always stuck with me.</p>
<p>So when I graduated, I was just looking for a school that had graphic design, which wasn&#8217;t that many. And Cal Poly ended up being one of those schools. So that&#8217;s where I dove into graphic design for the first time there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How was your time at Cal Poly Pomona?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
It was interesting because I think in high school I was pretty kept in. I didn&#8217;t do a lot of stuff. I feel like when I got to Cal Poly, I was in the dorms and I just got this freedom of like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, I&#8217;m on myself.&#8221; So I went down that, it was a lot of fun, but it was like I probably didn&#8217;t know what to do with all of that energy. So one thing is I would say my focus wasn&#8217;t there as it should be those first couple years. I want to say, despite that, I struggled a bit with graphic design there. For whatever reason, I didn&#8217;t make the connection.</p>
<p>There was a lettering class I remember. The lettering class that we had, it was all about craftsmanship. You had to draw, let&#8217;s say the letter E with Prisma color, and it was like a five-inch height type and you have to draw it so it literally looks like it&#8217;s printed. It was very difficult that class for me, not because I couldn&#8217;t do it, I could do it, but I didn&#8217;t have the patience. I wanted to design. I wanted to draw. I remember the instructor saying, &#8220;If you get a C or under in this class, I highly suggest you don&#8217;t continue in graphic design, &#8217;cause graphic design is really tough.&#8221; And I remember as, not to say fine artist, tough as well, but in terms of, I think what he was saying is, &#8220;You really have to love this to really continue in this direction.&#8221; It was one of the first classes in graphic design you were suppose to take.</p>
<p>So towards the whole class, I was just like, I&#8217;m struggling. I think I&#8217;m going to get a C. The final project was you get to draw something and use letter form and typography and visuals together. So I got to do this book cover. I remember I did a Malcolm X book cover and you put it up to class, the final, and everybody was just looking at this project, looking at my project, and the teacher was like, &#8220;Who did this?&#8221; It was the first time out of the whole entire term that I felt any kind of positivity in that class. All the time, it was just like&#8230; I remember going, &#8220;What&#8217;s happening?&#8221; And so I walked out of class and the instructor, said, &#8220;Hey, I know I said you shouldn&#8217;t be in graphic design, or if you get a C or lower, I think you&#8217;re going to get a C.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, I know.&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, I think you should stay in graphic design though.&#8221; So I was like, &#8220;Oh, huh, okay.&#8221; I walked away, still struggled, still was a tough time in the other classes.</p>
<p>Somebody had told me, &#8220;Hey, you got to take a class at ArtCenter. You&#8217;d be really good at it.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you see, because I&#8217;m struggling in every graphic design.&#8221; I did great in the painting classes. Those are the ones I really loved. So I took a night class. She ended up just convincing me, and I was nervous because I thought, man, back then I thought ArtCenter&#8217;s this sort of mecca. I took a night class, like an extension class while I was still at Cal Poly.</p>
<p>The first day you go and you present your ideas for a logo. I was just drawing and sketching and concepting stuff, put it up. I knew the moment the teacher started talking, the first, not even to my project, another student, I thought this, I&#8217;m in love. I literally felt like this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. And I just never took another class at Cal Poly. Again, Cal Poly, this was early on in Cal Poly for their graphic design. So they really were working things and some amazing designers came out of this. So that was just me at that time. But I just fell in love with graphic design at ArtCenter. I eventually finished my foundation at Cal Poly. Then I got a full scholarship actually after a couple classes I took at ArtCenter. I built my portfolio, some from Cal Poly, some from the ArtCenter, and I got a full scholarship, a James Irvine scholarship.</p>
<p>That was it. Kind of changed my life. The only hiccup during that time is a girl that I had been dating ended up getting pregnant. So I ended up having a child pretty early on. So I was starting ArtCenter while learning to be a father at the same time. So that&#8217;s another story.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Definitely all came all at once, but definitely matured me and I think eventually was all for the good, of course.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;ve heard from a lot of folks on this show that sometimes when they go into school having a lot of this artistic ability and love, sometimes the school can almost effectively snuff it out of them through the professors or the courses or anything like that. So it&#8217;s good that you still had that spark and decided to continue it by going somewhere else that was probably more focused in the direction that you needed to go, which of course now, based on where you&#8217;re at right now, that was a good direction to take.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. It&#8217;s crazy. You never know. Those little moments. I remember thinking like, &#8220;Oh gosh, the classes are at night and this and that.&#8221; But yeah, I loved those classes. I wanted to spend all my time in the ArtCenter at night classes then. So, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;ve graduated, you&#8217;re out there as a working designer. What was your early career before you started Pastilla?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
As I mentioned during school, I definitely like to get my hands in everything that was design. I think it&#8217;s one of the reasons I mentioned earlier, I like even just interior design. I have a passion for anything that is where you&#8217;re taking these elements of your artistic being and putting into some physical space or visual space or designing a city. So I definitely can see how all those things combining works together. And I did the same thing at school. And so when I graduated, I wanted to work somewhere that didn&#8217;t want to push me into one direction. I didn&#8217;t want to work in an agency that only had me do print, only doing web, or only doing motion. So the best place was a company then called&#8230; I had a couple different companies, but I think towards the end it was called Quick Band Networks or DVD Mags, which was you basically are designing a DVD magazine is what they call it.</p>
<p>So every month you would get a subscription of a DVD. One of them was short films. You get one DVD of short films, another one was music. So you get to have these music videos and all this content on these DVDs. I got to design basically the editorial, but the interactive part. So I got to do the identity of each of the magazines. I got to do the interactive part of the DVD. I got to do the animation of the DVD. I got to do the ads. So that to me was perfect. I got to get my hands in all of that. That&#8217;s really where I started for the first couple of years. I started freelancing a little bit after that. And that took me to Nokia for about four years. I worked there really as a freelancer.</p>
<p>I had a feeling at that time that at some point I&#8217;m going to start my own company just because I really enjoyed working with my own clients. So in between that, I took freelance projects at night and weekends, and I really enjoyed having full control of like, I&#8217;m presenting to the client, I&#8217;m giving them my vision, and I&#8217;m able to directly connect with them to be able to persuade them of the concept that I think is right. Rather than, here&#8217;s a bunch of ideas, now you have somebody else pitching it for you. So I really love that. So I thought, I&#8217;m going to start my own studio. But I needed to build up enough momentum as a freelancer.</p>
<p>So I really freelanced for about six years. Then when I was at Nokia, I said it was a time of my life, I got divorced in my late 20s and I thought might be a good time for me to do this now for a lot of different reasons. So I told Nokia, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to start my own company. If you guys would like to hire more of me, I&#8217;d be happy to take the work and continue as my own company.&#8221; And so Nokia was my first client. So I&#8217;m super thankful for that. For the first couple years, a lot of the work we did was Nokia. And so that was the first momentum of Pastilla, which was then called Pastilla Studio.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s amazing. You must have made some really great relationships at Nokia in order for them to entrust you with that. Say, I&#8217;m going to go out on my own. And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, great. We&#8217;ll still toss some work your way.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. I worked really hard for them, was really great people, a lot of them, some of them I knew from ArtCenter. I got to meet people from all over the world there and really was a time where technology was in a bit of transition. Imagine that was like 2000, a couple years before that. The iPhone definitely hadn&#8217;t come out. But before that, Google had just come out a couple years before that. It&#8217;s really early on. So I think I came with that diverse background of motion, interactive and print, and being able to cross-discipline. I think that really, the design director, Gerardo, liked that so I was able to really use my diverse background and experiences to Nokia and help the team out for those four years. So yeah, we did some great work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Honestly, coming with those skills at a time when as soon as you said DVD magazines, I was like, oh, I already know when this happened. This is turn of the century or turn the millennium, whatever, like &#8217;99, 2000. I remember those DVD magazines vividly. But yeah, coming with all those skills at a time when technology and design and the web were growing at this rapid pace, the stuff that you were doing didn&#8217;t really even exist 10 years ago. The advent of the personal computer and the internet becoming something that was no longer bound to DVDs or CDs that you get in the mail. The fact that things were growing at this rapid pace and you&#8217;re coming in with all these skills, especially at a time when companies are trying to decide, &#8220;How do I become a part of this new thing? How do I have a website? How do I take orders online or do all this stuff?&#8221; And you show up to the scene well-equipped like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ve got the skills if you got the work.&#8221; Sounds good.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yep, exactly. Exactly, exactly. It was a really fun time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now while you were building Pastilla, it sounds like there were other ventures that you were doing as well, right? You did some work with an app, you founded a film company, I guess. Tell me about those other ventures.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Obviously from let&#8217;s say 2004, those first 10 years were extremely busy for me. Continues to be anytime you&#8217;re a business owner. But those first 10 years I was basically raising my kids. I have a boy and a girl from my first marriage. And so I was raising the kids while starting this company essentially. We have 50-50 custody. So they got to share that experience. So those first 10 years was extremely busy. I would say around 2014 maybe, 2013, a friend came to me about an idea that he had for a startup, and he wanted me to look at it and see if I was interested in being his partner. He presented to me, did this whole pitch. And basically what it was is, to be honest, it&#8217;s not that different than what Instagram Reels is, what TikTok is now. The only company that was doing something sort of similar was musically that ended up becoming TikTok back then.</p>
<p>But even then it was very different, the UX. So basically at the end, what it was is you select video clips from your phone and it strings a video edited to music together. The thing that it did a little different was it took the music patterns and did the edit based on the pattern of the music, the rhythm, the beats per minute. There were 5 second ones, 15, 20, 30 I think it was. And so we built the app, we started it, we got some funding.</p>
<p>I learned a lot. Number one, I was able to use all of the tools and experience that I have learned, not just from owning an agency, but also working with clients as well. So it was really great. But it was tough. It was tough because it was at a time where we saw Instagram really starting to, I hate to say it, but just copy what everybody else was doing, so see what&#8217;s happening. And so like, &#8220;Oh, I like discovery. I like how Snapchat&#8217;s doing. Okay. Yeah. All right, let&#8217;s do this.&#8221; And then they bought the music catalog of Universal then.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s where, okay, this is going to be really tough to&#8230; Even though the technology was different and interesting, it was not going to be able to compete because it had to be a platform. So it was more like a tool and a feature. So after I would say couple years, we got some awards and things out of it and definitely some really good recognition. But we decided to close that. Around that time, I got married in 2014, so we&#8217;ve been married about nine years. And my wife is actually a filmmaker. She has always wanted to be a director. And during that time, she was building her career. So she started making brand films. She&#8217;s an amazing storyteller. It was perfect because obviously I had done motion, I had been part of doing BFX for films and so forth.</p>
<p>So we started&#8230; It&#8217;s her thing. This is what she runs to this day now. It&#8217;s been maybe five years, but we took some of the experience that I had in motion and put it into what now it&#8217;s actually called Fe Films, Fe Brand Films or Fe Films. So she does brand films, she does motion graphics work, but really the thrust is she&#8217;s looking to have it be a full-fledged feature film company. So she&#8217;s doing some short films and some narrative work on that. She&#8217;s got a couple scripts that have been optioned and she&#8217;s been working with. So that&#8217;s, when you saw Fe Brand Films, that&#8217;s what it is. All of the motion parts that were Pastilla or most of it got diverted into Fe Films now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now also you&#8217;re board president of Art Division. Can you tell me a bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah. About two, three years ago, let me back up a little bit from that because, say about 10 years ago I had this thought and I had mentioned to my wife, &#8220;Wow, our studios are empty on Saturdays and Sundays. Wouldn&#8217;t be amazing to go out and bus students from the different areas in Los Angeles and different groups and be able to teach kids graphic design?&#8221; I&#8217;ve always had a passion for kids. And at that point I had just started teaching as well. So I thought, yeah, this could be really interesting to do. And so I had it in the back of my head, but with everything else, this was really busy and I never really was able to put the gas on that.</p>
<p>And then about two, three years ago, somebody recommended me, introduced me to Art Division, which was a school in Rampart District of Los Angeles that was teaching fine arts, visual arts to kids specifically in that area, primarily of Latino immigrants. Me speaking Spanish, being Latino, I felt like, I wanted to get to know a little bit more about the school. So went in, heard a little bit about it. Definitely saw some potential for me from my background coming from teaching at ArtCenter. Also, some of the things I have been thinking about in the past and learning from what they&#8217;re doing, seeing if that could be something I can learn from and be a part of something that was really giving kids who have graduated high school, have amazing art talent, be able to give them the ability for another chance to develop a career in arts. And then me maybe be a part of introducing design to their curriculum.</p>
<p>So after six months of being on the board, I was selected as the board president. And for the past year and a half, that&#8217;s been my role. What I&#8217;ve been doing is slowly trying to find ways to include graphic design into the curriculum. And we hope, hopefully by this fall, we have at least a couple classes that we start to teach. We&#8217;re developing that right now. We&#8217;ve done some graphic design workshops where kids have come in to hear a little bit about who I am. I&#8217;m also looking to introduce some of the designers from Pastilla also potentially to even go there and do some teaching and so forth and be able to give back to these kids. Because some of them, they&#8217;re artists, they have a passion for art and design, but who knows? That art background could end up becoming a design passion and graphic design passion and can end up having a career. It&#8217;s really tough and really expensive to go to school these days, especially art school. So giving them some of these opportunities I think could be really interesting. So I&#8217;m looking forward to how this develops.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now along with this community work, which by the way sounds amazing. I would love to have been a part of a program like that when I was a kid. But you&#8217;re also an instructor at ArtCenter College of Design where you went to college. You&#8217;ve taught there now for almost nine years. Tell me a bit about what you teach.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah. I started teaching in the product design department, which is industrial design, we call industrial design, product design at ArtCenter. I was brought in to teach graphic design to the product design students essentially. And then that turned into me teaching the students, there was a class that helped the product design students or industrial design students how to brand themselves as they get ready to graduate, how do they position who they are and so forth. Those first classes, I would say that first year, year and a half, which for me to just get my feet wet and see do I like teaching period, how can I fit into my schedule? Does it work for me? And what are we getting out of it myself personally? And also am I being able to deliver and be good at it?</p>
<p>I loved it. I really, really liked doing it. I got as much out of the students as they get as much out of me. It&#8217;s definitely a very symbiotic relationship and I think that really helps my perspective in how I teach. And so I taught in that department and immediately obviously, I wanted to teach in the graphic design department. I was a natural inkling. It&#8217;s kind of tough to jump into teaching, especially ArtCenter because you have some of the top designers in the world and artists in the world teaching there and everybody wants to teach there. So I ended up getting asked to teach a branding class. They knew the work and stuff that I did. So I started teaching what now, the bulk of those years, up until maybe last year, I was teaching what was called Transmedia, which is basically a branding class that looks at what I mentioned, the cross sector of how branding and identity systems get implemented into and go into action when it comes to digital, motion, space, environmental.</p>
<p>So that was my class and I absolutely loved teaching, it was called Communication Design Five, Branding for Trans Media, I think. I did that for about six, seven years. I took a pause on that class. I was teaching two classes a week while I was still running the agency, still with this transition of the two new companies. Well, last summer I took a pause for two terms because teaching remotely and being remote as an agency was taking a toll on me. The classes at ArtCenter are about five hours. So if I was teaching two classes, that&#8217;s two days that I&#8217;m on class for five hours on screen. And then as I mentioned, my work is screen time stuff. So I ended up feeling after six, seven years, I don&#8217;t know if I have enough bandwidth.</p>
<p>Things started opening up obviously in the fall, but I started now with Art Division and my focus on there, I&#8217;m started to rethink a little bit of my long-term strategy in teaching and am I going to continue teaching at ArtCenter? So currently, I&#8217;m still teaching now. I&#8217;m back to teaching in the masters program, a branding futures class, which is I&#8217;m teaching with another instructor about strategies of future casting, how brands could future cast either their audience, either the business models, any kind of future strategic thinking of a brand. So I&#8217;m teaching that class now and I&#8217;m going to be teaching one more during the summer. But I think that after that I&#8217;ll be taking a pause for a while to do some art work and thinking with Art Division and put my time into that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look, you got to fill up your own cup first. It sounds like with everything you&#8217;re doing with Pastilla of course, and then also with teaching, you can get depleted very quickly.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. Definitely. It all kind of works together in a way. So it is definitely a lot to juggle, but it all works for the greater good, really, ultimately also of Pastilla because when I do things for Art Division, not only am I helping feed ourselves, but we also tell that story of how we&#8217;re involved in Art Division when we work with some of our other clients. So that&#8217;s really a important part, shows that our agency isn&#8217;t just working directly with clients that have social impact, but we are actually volunteering our time as well.</p>
<p>And then for ArtCenter, the same thing. I&#8217;ve learned so much from teaching, communicating your thoughts of visuals. I&#8217;m sure you know this, it&#8217;s very, very underestimated how difficult it is to be able to say, communicate in words what something should be visually. I don&#8217;t think we think too much about that, but it&#8217;s extremely hard and it&#8217;s definitely an art to that. I learned a lot of that through teaching and different personalities of creatives and designers and so forth that I think has also helped Pastilla. And also just teaching at ArtCenter as my brand, my personal brand has definitely just validates the agency, validates me and so forth. So it all works together in my head for a bigger vision.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, no, it makes sense. It all feeds into each other. I don&#8217;t mean this in a bad way, but the work you&#8217;re doing teaching, of course, that informs how you talk to clients or how you present the business to clients. But then you also say, &#8220;We&#8217;re not just an agency, we also give back to the community.&#8221; And so that is where Art Division comes in, where you&#8217;re saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m doing this to help out students that are interested in design or kids that are interested in design.&#8221; So it does all feed into each other, but I think what it does overall is it shows just how passionate you are about design, just outside of a client-vendor relationship. This is your lifeblood. You live and breathe this stuff.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Exactly. Love that. That&#8217;s exactly it. Yep.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do your students teach you?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Patience. I think, number one, it absolutely keeps me on the cusp of the, I hate to say design trends, but how culture is affecting design. How each generation takes what we&#8217;ve done and reinvents it, takes what they see in their environment and mixes it up to have this new creative aesthetic and how that continues to evolve. Absolutely, I always want to make sure that I am not blinded by my past or my history of what I always thought the design aesthetic was. I always want to feel like I&#8217;m at the edge of what&#8217;s happening, if not what&#8217;s also how things are changing and looking even ahead of that. So the students definitely keep me on my toes when it comes to that.</p>
<p>Second is understanding different design, creative mindsets or personalities. Different students take feedback completely different. And how you have to be very agile and nimble in how you communicate things. It could be how direct you are. It could be how open you are about a direction. Some students are really great at giving, they need very prescriptive directions on something and they need to develop that. They need to know things aren&#8217;t going to be so prescriptive. You need to connect the dots yourself, but you still have to be somewhat prescriptive. And then other students, if you&#8217;re too prescriptive, they literally will get stuck and confused because they don&#8217;t really understand exactly what you&#8217;re saying. And there&#8217;s everything in between.</p>
<p>So being able to read, pick up on how a student is reading you quickly, that&#8217;s really important, and being able to adjust your communication style. And that&#8217;s the same for our design team in-house and also clients as well. Communicating to clients, like you mentioned, we&#8217;re all creative to some point and when we&#8217;re communicating visuals, I take those little tools that I&#8217;ve learned in communicating to the students and I borrow those things to communicate to clients as well when I need to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you are at a really unique vantage point, I feel. One, you&#8217;re an agency owner with Pastilla, you&#8217;re also an instructor, so you&#8217;re teaching the next generation of designers. How has being a design instructor informed how you approach Pastilla?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny because we ended up changing the name of Pastilla from Pastilla Studio and in 2012 to Pasta Institute. It was supposed to be this sort of cheeky way to institutionalize something that isn&#8217;t really institutional and formalize it when it really isn&#8217;t formal. It was a very small studio then still. But there was something that made it feel like it&#8217;s established, but then at the end you&#8217;re kind of like, no, they&#8217;re a very buttoned down agency. So the one thing is that it was funny because the kind of person that I was and the designers that I would get, was naturally sort of a mentor and people would say, it&#8217;s kind of like a school where I saw designers really grow when they came to work at Pastilla and go and do amazing things, even after Pastilla.</p>
<p>And so that teaching part, I think was a part of Pastilla from the beginning, just naturally, I guess, maybe it just came from me or maybe just because I had to. Because I needed help and I needed freelancing and I had different people from different points of view, and that&#8217;s just my communication style. So that institute, I remember that now, it&#8217;s just Pastilla, obviously. We simplified it, but that part is still there. And for I would say a good eight years, every quarter at least, we had a different intern. I wanted to make sure that the designers that we have respect the interns and part of the work is that they do have to mentor. I&#8217;m mentoring as a creative director, the student, and also our design team that&#8217;s also working with the mentors is also teaching.</p>
<p>Teaching, it&#8217;s absolutely critical to any leadership. You can&#8217;t have a leader, not be a good teacher. You have to have somebody that can have that empathy of understanding that how to communicate to do something is an important part of being a leader and that not everybody takes or understands the same words or receives the same kind of communication the same way. And I think that&#8217;s an important part of being a good leader. And I felt like that&#8217;s an important part of Pastilla. And the creative team, the account team, the management team, and I try to continue to infuse that. Sometimes probably, I would say maybe the designers are like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, there&#8217;s too much work. I&#8217;m teaching and designing.&#8221; But I think in the long run, they&#8217;re going to see that this is some important tools that they learned.</p>
<p>So in short, before I was teaching at ArtCenter, I think we had that part embedded into our culture, that teaching impact or that element. Then I started teaching, that just got elevated, and then I just literally created with Pastilla, I would just have internship programs. So the students would come from ArtCenter. They&#8217;d intern at Pastilla for three months, continue getting taught there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you mentioned with the education work you&#8217;re doing with ArtCenter, that part of what you&#8217;re teaching is about future strategic thinking. From your perspective, what do you think agencies can do moving forward to ensure that the future of creatives reflect this world that we&#8217;re in right now? Of course we hear a lot about diversity and inclusion. There&#8217;s always going to be some new bleeding edge tech, which right now is what AI, Chat GPT, et cetera. How can agencies start to move forward, making sure that this next generation of designers, creators, et cetera, really reflect the world that we&#8217;re communicating and creating for?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
I think one of the things, along the line of teaching, I feel like at least that was a feeling when I was in school, was that if you don&#8217;t come with a absolutely impeccable portfolio, you cannot work at some of these big larger agencies. This was the case. Thankfully, I went to ArtCenter, I had that experience, I had that portfolio at that time. But not everybody gets those opportunities. Not everybody finds those paths. Maybe they might have the opportunity, but they somehow didn&#8217;t have that one person that said, &#8220;Hey, take a class here,&#8221; or whatever. There&#8217;s lots of amazing schools in the world, in the country. But I feel that a lot of it starts in looking, when you&#8217;re interviewing somebody, agencies and design companies need to look farther deep into who that person is that they&#8217;re interviewing, way past their physical, where they&#8217;re at, at that moment with their portfolio.</p>
<p>Because for us to start developing or having the agencies and creative agencies, digital agencies, every kind of agency, reflect the real world, the designers that we have, the copywriters, the creative directors, the animators, the programmers reflect the world that we actually live in. We have to know that not everybody is getting the opportunities that everybody who&#8217;s working currently in the agency&#8217;s got, period. And to do that, we have to take some risk and we have to take initiative. I think the number one thing is to open our eyes to giving opportunities to people who are not at that moment fully polished to be working at that company. And there&#8217;s portfolio schools, there&#8217;s lots of different ways that somebody can advance themselves, but most of it is about the work. But you can get that experience sometimes working at an agency. If you have just a little bit of the excitement, the passion, the energy, and that natural creative tendency, even without having a finished portfolio, if you&#8217;re given the opportunity at an agency, you can develop that portfolio quick.</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s not easy. It is not easy, and it&#8217;s expensive because the design teams, everything we do is labor. So things will take longer, the people. But I think in the long run, we have to give people the opportunities to, especially underserved, people of color when they come knocking at our doors as an agency and you see their work, you see where they&#8217;re at, not turn them down or away just because their portfolio isn&#8217;t fully finished. There is space for them to grow. And those, sadly, a lot of the opportunities that come are because of that network. And I understand, you get portfolios come at you 24-7, but every now and then I&#8217;ll get one and I&#8217;m like, huh. Their portfolio is not fully fleshed out. And they don&#8217;t have the ArtCenter, art school, art design, design portfolio, but there&#8217;s something in their personality, something in their CV, something in their work, one project, it could be that can show some kind of interesting perspective that you could look at. And if we&#8217;re looking closer, we&#8217;re able to maybe find some talent that just hasn&#8217;t had the opportunity.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen that with Pastilla. One of our top designers that we have, I would say one of the top designers we&#8217;ve ever had at Pastilla didn&#8217;t go to art school like that. He went to a two-year school, it wasn&#8217;t a really fully flushed out program, didn&#8217;t have that kind of portfolio at all. We gave him that opportunity and he&#8217;s an amazing designer. So I think agencies need to be open to giving more experiences like that. That&#8217;s what I hope to do with Art Division is take that with the designers that go there, is find those ones that have that passion, be able to connect them. If the student wants to be connected, connect them to some of these other agencies. Just a simple, &#8220;Hey, check out this person&#8217;s work. I thought this. I thought this was interesting.&#8221; And giving them an opportunity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I highly agree with what you&#8217;re saying. I was just talking to a colleague of mine, Ricardo Roberts. He has a agency in New York called Bien, B-I-E-N. They do an apprenticeship type program where they bring in designers, maybe they&#8217;re junior designers or maybe they don&#8217;t have a fully polished portfolio, but they help to give them that experience that they need in order to then get out there and really work, whether that&#8217;s with agencies, whether that&#8217;s directly with brands in house, more of those types of opportunities need to be available.</p>
<p>I agree with you, as I&#8217;ve talked to folks here on the show that have worked in advertising and such, agencies can be pretty stuck in their ways about the type of people that they want and the type of experience that they have to have. They have to have followed almost a particular script in order to just get in the door. This is even at smaller boutique agencies. So it definitely sounds like that whole world needs a bit of a paradigm shift, I think.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah, no, absolutely. I love that. I would love to hear more about his program. I think formalizing something like that is awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I will connect the two of you after this interview. I will most certainly do that.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you stay creative and inspired in your work? With everything that you&#8217;re doing, I feel like you have a lot of input coming at you.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve always been a pretty curious person and I hope that I continue to be until my last days because I feel like that is the thing that hopefully will keep me up to speed on everything that is design at that moment. I would say design&#8217;s going to be completely different the next 30, 40 years. And I hope to know what&#8217;s happening and not be like, I would always say when I was in school with some of the older instructors, everything that we were doing was like, &#8220;Ah, everything looks the same.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like now I see some designers say the same thing to people in their early 20s. We have to understand things evolve, things change, and I want to be able to have that understanding. So staying curious and questioning and being, like I mentioned earlier, teaching and having young designers is a really important part of understanding that, how things evolve.</p>
<p>And so that definitely always keeps me fresh. I always have that curiosity of what is new, what is next, definitely keeps me fresh and excited. Right now obviously, everything happening with AI is really, really interesting to me. It&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ve always known is coming and we&#8217;ve seen it coming. And now tools are just more in front of us and the potential to be now in design where we&#8217;re going to see a total evolution of, and even fast forward of how we think and how we can be more hyper-focused in the creative and not so much of the doing. How we create is going to change as well. Even how to take simple things like a logo, what does that mean now in AI? Can a logo be so dynamic that it&#8217;s absolutely never static? Can a company have a logo where every customer has their own version because it&#8217;s that dynamic? Asking these questions I think are going to be super interesting. So always being on top of what&#8217;s happening, combining that with my experiences in the past, taking that in, I think that excites me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give for aspiring creative professionals out there? They&#8217;re heard your story in this interview. They see everything that you&#8217;re doing in the community. What advice would you have for them?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Wanting to be, let&#8217;s say, own a design agency or just jumping into graphic design?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We&#8217;ll say wanting to own an agency because I feel like a lot of folks that I speak with now are definitely leaning towards more entrepreneurial efforts. Even folks in-house are trying to strike out on their own. So yeah, approach it that way.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
I would say, number one, you need to be extremely patient. We hear that. We know like, &#8220;Oh yeah, you got to be patient. Things come to those who wait.&#8221; But it really does. In that patience, you&#8217;re going to have a lot of times where you feel like you can&#8217;t continue. I remember the first 10 years when I started Pastilla, there was about three moments that I thought&#8230; Okay, I remember the first time was in the financial crisis. I thought, &#8220;Okay, crap, this really sucks. I don&#8217;t like this feeling. I don&#8217;t like this uncertainty. I don&#8217;t like this weight that&#8217;s on me.&#8221; And I thought, &#8220;If I make it through this and something like this happens again, I can&#8217;t continue.&#8221; And then four or five years later, boom, another blip and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Crap. Dang it. No, I&#8217;m going to continue, but you know what? This is it. After this one, that&#8217;s it.&#8221; Then you get one more, boom.</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s crazy is that over time, you learn that those blips, those bumps, you just learn how to deal with them. You&#8217;re smarter behind dealing with them. It&#8217;s not that the blips go away, you just aren&#8217;t scared of them at all. You&#8217;ve faced everything and every single time you&#8217;re a better entrepreneur, you&#8217;re a better planner, you&#8217;re more strategic. You know how to handle the downturns. That tends to scare away people. I know because I had those thoughts and I thought like, &#8220;That&#8217;s it.&#8221; But every single time you have to have that faith of, &#8220;You know what? I&#8217;ve got to believe in myself. I think I can do it. I love this.&#8221; You have to love this design industry. You got to love what you do. You got to love your clients and who you work with, and being creative, that definitely has to drive everything because if not, you could just be a banker or investment banker or something because there&#8217;s other ways to make money.</p>
<p>But this definitely is a combination of a lifestyle. And yeah, obviously there&#8217;s financial reward with it as well, but it definitely isn&#8217;t easy. Then I would say consistency. It&#8217;s not a sprint, it&#8217;s definitely a marathon. And there&#8217;s I would say in that marathon, there&#8217;s a bunch of small sprints. It&#8217;s one sprint and then you go into one phase and you got a marathon, marathon, marathon, another sprint. But it&#8217;s the consistency, the compounding effect of all of those moments of sprinting and marathoning and sitting and waiting and moving that all compile together for the good.</p>
<p>I would say in terms of, I think probably the biggest thing is people always ask, &#8220;How do you get clients?&#8221; And things like that. I think for me, one of the things that I learned early on, and I learned this as a freelancer, and this might seem super simple, but to this day, it&#8217;s probably the main thing that continues to feed our business, which is show people the work that you do. You finish a project, show it to people, tell the story. In the beginning, one on ones. I remember I was freelancing. I&#8217;d finish a project and then I&#8217;d have seven or people that I wanted to share that work with. And I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Hey John, how&#8217;s it going? I haven&#8217;t seen you for a while. We should have lunch, da da da. Are you still working at blah, blah, blah? I just finished this project. It&#8217;s down around where you live. It&#8217;s a new identity. It was a lot of fun, da da da.&#8221; That&#8217;s it. It was like a PDF or jpg in the email.</p>
<p>That was the first five, seven years of that I continued to freelance work that then got to start the company. And to this day, that&#8217;s exactly what I do. Now, it&#8217;s more formalized. And we do more of them. It&#8217;s not just projects, it&#8217;s articles, it&#8217;s stories. It&#8217;s the same thing everybody does. But I was doing it very early on where I didn&#8217;t really have anything to say other than sharing my work. And it was very intentional and very sincere as well. Because this business is about relationships. It&#8217;s a lot about relationships.</p>
<p>So you treat people good, you do really good work. You do everything you can to make sure the client&#8217;s happy and that will pay for itself. And from there, you share the work with those people, they&#8217;re going to tell other people about that, about you. And that continues to build more and more and more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want that next chapter of your story to be?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
The past five years, we&#8217;ve grown exponentially. I feel that things are a lot more, I would say self-running, automated. The agency and the team is much more structured than it ever was. There&#8217;s some positive and negatives to that. The positive part is that it&#8217;s less weight on me. The positive part is that we can grow necessarily, not directly with me having to be on the ground every single second. There&#8217;s things that are built that can continue to feed the company on its own even without me. So those are the good things.</p>
<p>The downside is that there&#8217;s a lot of weight, or the downside I would say is that I do less creative than I did before, and I do more strategic thinking of the company. There&#8217;s been great things and I have to continue doing that. And I know in the next five years with that growth that&#8217;s happened, we have had some interest in people acquiring us, purchasing us. But I think we&#8217;ve contemplated a lot of those things in the past, especially last year and we continue to. But I think this kind of growth in the next, I would say five to seven years, is probably going to continue.</p>
<p>But what we&#8217;re going to do is, it&#8217;s a hard question because I think we&#8217;re in the middle of pivoting a little bit, but I would say potentially doubling or tripling in size to then have a bigger creative team, to serve more of the same kind of clients that we do, that we have right now. And where I feel, and that by note means we&#8217;re going to be a hundred million dollar agency or anything like that, but that&#8217;s going to be able to scale us to the point where I don&#8217;t have to do the kind of operationalizing, the strategic business work that I do on a day-to-day. I think that&#8217;s the goal. Where I then focus my time is on more of the relationship parts of the company, my relationships and how to continue to foster that and less being on the ground for the business right now.</p>
<p>To do that, we&#8217;re probably going to find maybe more partners to do that growth or maybe do some larger hires. We have to see. There&#8217;s some different strategies we have and options we have to do that. But I think double, triple in size than where we are now and me being less of those&#8230; Let&#8217;s say if we had another talk, Maurice, like in five, six years, I&#8217;m not telling you that I&#8217;m on a call six, seven hours a day, maybe three. And then the rest of the time I&#8217;m maybe meeting people or maybe more involved in Art Division or have some other nonprofit that&#8217;s maybe a part of not Pastilla or part of Art Division that is involved in the same kind of topics that we&#8217;re talking about, bringing art and design to youth to create more opportunities. Something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about Pastilla, about your work? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
Our agency&#8217;s website is pastilla.co, so pastilla.co, P-A-S-T-I-L-L-A .co. You can also find our agency on Instagram. And our Instagram is, it&#8217;s Pastilla, P-A-S-T-I-L-L-A, Agency, A-G-E-N-C-Y. That&#8217;s her Instagram. And my Instagram also is Rudy, R-U-D-Y, M, V, so upside down A, V-N-N-I-N-G. So again, Rudy, R-U-D-Y, M-V-N-N-I-N-G. You can find me there as well. Yeah, those are my main channels. I&#8217;m also on LinkedIn. You probably just search me there. I don&#8217;t know what the exact profile name is there, but probably search Rudy Manning, you could find me on LinkedIn as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, we&#8217;ll find it. We&#8217;ll link it all down in the show notes. Rudy Manning, thank you so much for coming on the show. I think it&#8217;s definitely evident from your story, from the work you do out in the community, your education work, Pastilla, like I alluded to earlier in the interview, it&#8217;s clear you live and breathe design, but outside of that you have this sort of fiery passion to give back to the community and to also push the industry forward.</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re doing it at a pace and a rate and a breadth that is inspiring for me to see. I hope it&#8217;s inspiring for our audience as well, for them to see what more can they do to try to really advance and push things forward. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Rudy Manning:</b><br>
That&#8217;s awesome, Maurice. Thank you. Thank you so much for having me. Appreciate it. Awesome podcast. So thank you so much for having me again.</p>

<p>The past few years has been a testing ground for a lot of creatives. For Breon Waters II, he&#8217;s used this time to dive deeper into design across the digital world and the real world. And the results have been paying off!</p>
<p>Our conversation began with a look at his line of letterpress greeting cards, which are a fun mix of old-world printing techniques and cutting-edge technology. We also talked about his work at DEPT, and Breon shared how he came into product design throughs his earlier explorations in visual design and UI/UX. Breon has been steadily building his career brick by brick, and that&#8217;s given him a strong design foundation that will serve him well into the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Hi, I&#8217;m Breon Waters II. By day, I&#8217;m a senior product designer at an agency called DEPT. By a later part of the day, I&#8217;m the founder of Holiday Free Of, a company that creates weird but memorable experiences that merge print and augmented reality.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I remember when we met a few years ago, you were sending out these letterpress Christmas cards. That&#8217;s where Holiday Free Of sort of grew out of, right?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yep. It started back when I graduated from ArtCenter, so back in 2011, which is wild to think it&#8217;s been that long. It was just a way back in before times, having in-person meetings or interviews and having to leave behind something for people I was doing interviews with to remember me, hopefully help me get a job. I&#8217;m not exactly sure how the hell I thought of Christmas cards. The whole idea is being not about Christmas, so it&#8217;s a Holiday Free Of these weird things happening for me. I think the first one was wishing me a Holiday Free Of a Christmas tree filled with renegade ninja squirrels. So really kind of off-the-wall, bizarre things, but really showing my personality. But also gave me a chance to really do the type of things I&#8217;m going to do creatively and really just get out of my comfort zone.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The cards are great. I have the one that you sent me last year right here by my desk. It&#8217;s great, really thick paper stock, of course, because it&#8217;s letterpress. And it&#8217;s so fun to interact with. It&#8217;s really a great idea.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Oh, thank you. I&#8217;m glad that people don&#8217;t just think I&#8217;m some weirdo and just people actually enjoy it and not just me laughing like a little schoolgirl while I make these, so I really appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, how has the year been going so far? How&#8217;s 2023 been treating you?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been fast. I know I&#8217;m not the only one, but it seems unimaginable that we&#8217;re basically almost, I guess, a quarter of the way done with the year already. My son just turned two. My daughter&#8217;s about to turn five. I&#8217;m going to turn 40 next month. So just a whole lot of milestones are happening. But yeah, definitely blessed. Things could have definitely been worse in the pandemic, but thankfully we have a roof over our head, haven&#8217;t really had to have much pain or strife or whatnot. But all is good, just working and then trying to actually launch Holiday Free Of this year. That&#8217;s my third baby, if you will, is just seeing if there&#8217;s a market for that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I definitely think there&#8217;s a market for that. I mean, it&#8217;s funny, I think about the last place where I worked, and one of the things that I was helping them with was getting together their swag. Because, you know, people think of tech startups, they think of T-shirts or maybe some little glossy pamphlet that you might get at a trade show and that you&#8217;ll throw away later. I find a lot of tech startups, like SaaS companies, et cetera, are always looking for unique merch.</p>
<p>So, at the last place I was at, I know we were looking at socks, we were looking at custom one-by-one keycaps for mechanical keyboards. I think those cards could be great. And I say this also because we did dabble in doing some print. We did a legit print magazine. That could be something great if you want to tap into that. The swag markets doing custom AR letterpress cards for companies. That&#8217;d be great. That could be a good way to do it.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
No, thank you for that, Maurice. I&#8217;ll definitely keep that in mind because that&#8217;s a damn good idea. I&#8217;ll have to [inaudible 00:06:24] on to that one for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you come up with the ideas for the card? I know you mentioned the name of it being Holiday Free Of. Do you keep a running list of stuff?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah. It always happens last minute, unfortunately. I think maybe one year I had the idea done maybe by September. But last year I was basically working on the design in November, a couple weeks before Thanksgiving. I have sketchbooks since starting design in college and I keep onto them and just writing word stuff. And sometimes, I think actually for this year&#8217;s, I was looking back at a sketchbook, it was a couple years ago, and just the idea of rock, paper, scissors. I was like, &#8220;Huh, there&#8217;s something kind of interesting there.&#8221;</p>
<p>It starts with a theme and just trying to figure out, &#8220;Okay, what&#8217;s the story from that theme?&#8221; And I can&#8217;t reveal the story fully yet, but it&#8217;s pulling inspiration from old school wrestling posters, boxing posters, patch show print-type posters and things like that for inspiration. I remember just being a kid, too, watching old school WWF back in the day. And just taking those memories, and what would happen if that fell in this world?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I could see something like that, that could be pretty fun.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
I was lucky to get a really talented 3D animator and illustrator, Mr Lubo Designs, to collaborate with him, and just really took my silly idea and really made it possible. Because I wasn&#8217;t sure if I could even make it move with animation. I thought it was going to be static. He was able to make it move, and knocked it out the park. Really proud of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So let&#8217;s talk about DEPT, which is the agency where you work at. You&#8217;re working there as a senior product designer. Tell me a little bit about your work and how you found out about them.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Well, when I joined them, they were called it Rocket Insights. They were acquired by DEPT, I think five or four years ago. We&#8217;re officially known as the digital products US arm of DEPT. So, we basically design digital products for DEPT on the state side here. And how I found them actually was reached out, I forgot the name of the actual site, but you know there&#8217;s job placing sites, recruiters. But this one was basically by AI. And so I was working actually with another East Coast agency, funny enough, and I left and got approached by DEPT and the rest is history. I&#8217;ll be working with them two years in April.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
There&#8217;s not really a typical day. We&#8217;re kind of weird. We&#8217;re an agency, we work as consultants. But depending on the client, we could really be almost working an in-house counterpart to their company. So right now I&#8217;ve been working with FIFA for NFT projects. I joined it in November right before the World Cup started, which is the craziest time to join the project. But also learned a ton though too, because the project was going on way before that in preparations for all that goes into World Cups and big events like that.</p>
<p>So for this, basically, there&#8217;s two designers, a team of developers on our end and a project manager. And we have two different clients on behalf of the other side. And really just working with them for new features, figuring out what are things need to be included. One big push is the Women&#8217;s World Cup is coming up this year, and so we&#8217;re working on initiatives and features specifically for that. So that&#8217;s been basically the start of this year has been all focused on designing for the Women&#8217;s World Cup for this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you mentioned the team. Are you working between different clients or do you just focus on one client for that specific project?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah, thankfully it&#8217;s just been one client. In the past I&#8217;ve had multiple clients. I&#8217;m trying to think back. Actually, before this project, I was on a design sprint and we were working with a mom and pop jewelry that&#8217;s looking to explore NFTs, and really seeing if they were to decide to create something within NFT world, what would it be? Is there a market for it? Who would it be for? And so that was basically a two-week sprint, just kind of along with the client learning what the hell NFTs are. Like what they&#8217;re all about, what&#8217;s Web 3.0?</p>
<p>And really just talking with them and potential users, just seeing what makes sense for them. What&#8217;s the story to tell? What would be their version of NFT? And it was really eye-opening just because NFT&#8217;s a real buzzword now. You hear the CryptoPunks and Tiffany&#8217;s collab&#8217;d and made millions of dollars. And people think, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s so easy, I&#8217;ll do that.&#8221; But every artist wants to be Picasso, or insert famous&#8230; or Basquiat. But there&#8217;s how many different artists and how many Basquiats? It&#8217;s not the same. It&#8217;s not as easy as that. So it&#8217;s really all about value. How do you really show that people should care or buy what you&#8217;re selling?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
This might be an odd question to ask, but do people still care about NFTs? I mean, I ask this because a year ago, I swear you were seeing success stories about NFTs, and Adidas was making NFTs, and people were designing NFTs and making all this money. And now it&#8217;s like you barely hear about NFTs. Have they fallen out of favor?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Right. No, I think there&#8217;s something to that. I remember last year the Super Bowl was everything about crypto. And all those companies basically are bankrupt or out of work. I think there still is, but I think we&#8217;re still so early in NFTs and Web 3.0 that it&#8217;s kind of like looking back in the first websites, where it&#8217;s just wild, wild west, crazy colors, rainbows everywhere. But it&#8217;s kind of matured. And I guess the trails of social media were there before, but it&#8217;s more mature now. And even still, trying to figure out what that&#8217;s going to be moving on forward. I think it&#8217;s kind of same for NFTs. NBA Top Shot is still popular, but it&#8217;s weird though, where it&#8217;s like you watch a game, it&#8217;s copyrighted by ESPN or Fox or insert whatever big broadcasting company.</p>
<p>And so it&#8217;s not even really clear. They own the rights to play it, so how&#8217;s it work you owning a highlight? I&#8217;m not sure exactly how that works. But even in that workshop I mentioned earlier, they mentioned NFTs for buying houses or for even for the contract sides, for if you&#8217;re working with artists. And having basically Web 3.0, big word, but basically it&#8217;s receipts. So basically capturing from the first person that bought it to fast-forward endless in the future. And so something like that, it&#8217;s not big and exciting and sexy as a Ja Morant NFT. But I think something that&#8217;s transaction-based, that could be a huge thing for it, but we&#8217;re still early for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I still don&#8217;t know if NFTs&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve really penetrated the mainstream yet. I know why brands are jumping on it now. It&#8217;s all about that perceived value. Just like folks were really bang on about the metaverse a year and a half ago and stuff. I think people probably still are, but not to the fervor that it was back then. I attended a conference&#8230; When was this, was this in 2020? Might have been 2021. I attended a conference about the metaverse in the metaverse.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like, I have a Meta Quest, one of those helmet things or whatever. It was an interesting conference. There were some sessions that were, I don&#8217;t know if there was intentionally supposed to be that hokey and sales pitchy. There was one where this guy had bought some virtual real estate inside of the metaverse during a talk.</p>
<p>He bought a 800 square foot piece of land for, I don&#8217;t know, $10,000 or something like that. Probably more than that. 25,000, that&#8217;s what it was, he bought it for $25,000. And I&#8217;m like, why? It only exists in this particular metaverse subdivision, which is the best way that I could put it. Because there&#8217;s still a big interoperability problem with the metaverse. And I think this extends to NFTs too, where you can use an NFT maybe in Horizon World, but can you use it in Solana World or can you use it in another metaverse? Are you really able to take it with you? But speaking of things to take with you, after the conference, they gave us an NFT.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They sent us an email, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Here&#8217;s your NFT.&#8221; And then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;This is how you claim it. Get your hardware wallet and do this, this and this.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not doing that.&#8221; First of all, I have no idea what that is. Do I have to buy that? It&#8217;s all good. I&#8217;ll just tell people I went, it&#8217;s not that big a deal.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah, that sounds like&#8230; I imagine it wasn&#8217;t the same as actual attending a conference in real life. It doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s on par with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. You attend the conference in real life, you get a badge. I keep all my conference badges. You get something like that. But this was something called POAP, Proof of Attendance Picture or something like that. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Is this like a Foursquare badge? What do I do with this?&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what it means for me to have that, or how to obtain it or why it&#8217;s useful. So I think I let it lapse because they kept sending me emails like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget to claim your NFT.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how, nor do I care, but thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a bad sort of a gift when you have to repeatedly ask that person, &#8220;Hey, you want to open the gift? Hey, you want to open the gift?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I think it&#8217;s cool, though, that you get to work with of new technologies with clients. So then you as an individual get to find a way to get your own understanding around it.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. Even DEPT, our CEO, Dimi, there&#8217;s been a huge push and they&#8217;re all in for all things Web 3.0 and AI. Just like you said, being at the forefront where of course there&#8217;s a lot&#8230; Just like the experience you mentioned for the conference, where it&#8217;s not the greatest, but for the ones that do figure it out early on, being well-versed to really design and tell stories within this, it really will be a huge thing. But just early on, it&#8217;s going to be really rough and wacky. And a lot of bad things are&#8230; Hopefully not bad things, but bad experiences happening. But yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;m looking at the DEPT website now. You all have a Web 3.0 division, it says, &#8220;With a global team of over 300 specialists, including solidity engineers, ethicists, economists and game designers, we have been building for Web 3.0 And the metaverse since 2015. Our pioneering work is fueled by patented and proprietary technology.&#8221; Okay. I didn&#8217;t know the Web 3.0 was a thing in 2015, but that&#8217;s cool. I mean, I&#8217;m not doubting y&#8217;all, I&#8217;m just saying, I&#8217;m looking through it like, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s cool.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
I agree. [inaudible 00:17:34] my paycheck.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the most satisfying thing about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
I think really, and it&#8217;s going to sound sappy or cheesy, but when a client comes and they have an issue, or they&#8217;re working on something not sure of, it&#8217;s a really good feeling of helping people actualize, not their dreams, that&#8217;s too big and broad, but helping them get past their hurdle or issue or their problem. I think that&#8217;s really cool. Even for things like design sprints where on day one you have this big issue, you don&#8217;t know what the hell you&#8217;re going to do. It&#8217;s a whole mystery. And day by day everybody&#8217;s learning from it. And on that Friday, you do five user tests and just learn so much. And just that feeling of going from not knowing to, &#8220;Hey, there&#8217;s some [inaudible 00:18:28] here.&#8221; That&#8217;s a really good feeling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you approach that process of designing a new product or a new feature? I know you&#8217;ve mentioned the team that you usually are working with, but what does that process look like?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
It definitely varies on what we&#8217;re doing. But a lot of times we have a lot of really talented strategists that during the sprint doing the work together with us or sometimes doing it before our project or our phase of the project starts. So, really getting insights from that. And I think it sounds cheesy again, but some of the biggest skill sets for designers, not just product designers, but designers in general, just listening and just asking questions, just trying to learn as much as you can from your client.</p>
<p>They know it better than you do, but they&#8217;re coming to you for your expertise to actually how to visualize and build this. And a lot of times, too, people aren&#8217;t able to really say what they&#8217;re trying to say. And be able to decipher between that what are they really trying to say? And even user testing, talk with users, really listening, paying attention, getting out of the way and seeing what they&#8217;re doing. And taking all that together and helping it to inform your designs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s learn a little bit more about you, about how you got to where you are now. You&#8217;re originally from California, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yep. A city called Rialto, California.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Rialto, where&#8217;s that?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
That&#8217;s in the Inland Empire. I like to say, if you&#8217;ve seen Friday After Next, it&#8217;s where Day-Day and his dad moved to, Rancho Cucamonga. So, next door to that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. All right. So, outside of LA, but it&#8217;s not quite a suburb I would say, right?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Right. It&#8217;s not quite the desert, but desert adjacent. And yeah, it&#8217;s a big bunch of different cities where basically you&#8217;ll go through it if you drive to Palm Springs, or if you&#8217;re looking to drive to Vegas, you&#8217;ll have to go through it. At least from going through LA.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. What was it like growing up there?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
It was cool. I loved it. Basically, imagine like most kids, you play out in the streets, playing tag or football, basketball, hide and go seek and whatnot. Where basically, it&#8217;s old school, but once the street lights came on, okay, you better bring your ass inside before you get in trouble. But yeah, just having friends around the neighborhood, just hanging out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that where you first got exposed to a lot of design and art and stuff?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Thinking back, the first design or art was from my dad. And he wasn&#8217;t a classically-trained artist or anything, but I remember growing up, there&#8217;s a big portrait of my mom he painted. And there&#8217;s also, he did some different scratchboard pieces. They&#8217;re hanging up and just always remember seeing them as a kid. And so I&#8217;d always see that. And I was always sketching stuff. My thing was being a baseball player and designing airplanes, which are a perfect pair, right?</p>
<p>So, I would always draw that. And when I was in middle school, back when you would take shopping paper bags and wrap them around your books, I would draw Jimi Hendrix and baseball players on it. So never really blatantly had someone as a kid say, &#8220;Hey, this is designer art.&#8221; But from that and my dad really artistic in drawing, that&#8217;s where I really got my first dose of it. Or dose is the wrong word, but first learned about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so you kept with that imagination of drawing and getting into it enough to the point where you decided you wanted to study it in college. I&#8217;m curious about this, and I know we talked about this a little bit before recording, but you went to college in North Dakota.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yep, that&#8217;s correct.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Which is, I mean, it&#8217;s not far from California, but you got to tell me-</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:22:17]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s far? Okay. Oh, okay. I mean, I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s not on the other coast. But what brought that on? You went to Minot State University. That&#8217;s in North Dakota near the Canadian border, so you&#8217;re up there.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yes, sir. [inaudible 00:22:31]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Why? What brought you to Minot?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
You sound like you&#8217;re my therapist, which I don&#8217;t have, Maurice, so maybe I should have you be my therapist. Young Breon thought he was going to be a major league baseball player, playing first base for the Angels, and so I was hell-bent on playing baseball. After high school, I went to Cal Poly Pomona, which is a really good college for different engineering disciplines and especially aerospace. It&#8217;s in Pomona, California, actually, not far from where my folks live. So I was there, and excited being in college. But well, I didn&#8217;t just learn then, but I was terrible in math. I&#8217;d forget equations, especially on finals day. When you move into the senior level of classes, you do really cool stuff. They have partnerships with Boeing, working on airplanes and different things like that. I imagine now they&#8217;re probably working on drones and stuff. But I was bad at math. I thought, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to play baseball there.&#8221; I tried walking on and tried out for the team two years and didn&#8217;t make it, but I was still&#8230; The desire to play baseball, I wanted to do that.</p>
<p>And it was funny, a family friend of ours was working in the career center at the time. And she had me do a career placement test where you answer a series of questions. Whatever you pick, it&#8217;s kind of like, &#8220;Hey, you should do this,&#8221; or, &#8220;Hey, you should do this.&#8221; And so, one of the results was graphic design. I was like, &#8220;Huh, I never really heard about that.&#8221; I took some art classes in high school but didn&#8217;t really think too much of it. And so after that it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to switch to graphic design, but I still want to play baseball.&#8221; So I looked online and looked for colleges that had a baseball team and graphic design programs and just emailed a bunch of their coaches and whatnot. And I heard back from Minot State University and a school, Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa or Sioux Falls, Iowa.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Iowa&#8217;s Sioux City. I think Sioux Falls is in North Dakota.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Okay, thank you. So, Sioux City, Iowa. And so my mom, God bless her heart, I told my mom and dad, &#8220;I was going to major in aerospace engineering and you&#8217;re paying for college. So yeah, I&#8217;m not going to do that. I&#8217;m going to go move to the Midwest and play baseball and do graphic design.&#8221; [inaudible 00:24:48] my dad, but my mom is just&#8230; And I get that too, my dad, you want your kid to be having something secure, not the whole starving artist kind of visualization. So I definitely get that now, being a dad. But my mom was really just supportive, &#8220;Okay, yep, we&#8217;re going to do this.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so we flew out to Minot State. I visited the school, tried out, and we rented the car and we drove from Minot to Sioux City, Iowa. Tried out there too. And just so happened where I got a chance to meet the team in Minot, it was during their tournament days, and just hit it off with them and just wanted to be a part of it. And that was how I went to being from California to moving to North Dakota, never having seen snow in my life, and being in blizzards there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I was going to say, I mean, of course, weather-wise that&#8217;s wild. But I mean, baseball and graphic design, that would&#8217;ve been an interesting Venn diagram intersection.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah. And it doesn&#8217;t make sense either, where California is one of the best parts for baseball. And I moved from there to North Dakota, which is not known for baseball. So, on hindsight, not the wisest decision, but it did lead me towards that graphic design path, so I&#8217;m grateful for that. And that was the right path for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So, while you were at Minot, you studied art, you focused on graphic design and marketing as well. How was your time there? Do you feel like you got a good foundation as a designer?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah, I think it was a good entry level way. Whereas, I actually was playing baseball there. I couldn&#8217;t play my senior year, which was at the time devastating, but it really worked out because I actually did my own senior solo show instead of&#8230; That wouldn&#8217;t have been possible at all if I was playing baseball. So basically, there, they introduce you, you have a class on typography, photography. I forgot what level of Photoshop or Illustrator it was, but it was back when you had the fifties looking MacBooks, or not MacBooks [inaudible 00:26:52]. So that was the time of that. So it did give me that sense, but I think one of the best part was the art side.</p>
<p>I had a lot of good professors there. Bill, and Walter Piehl was really amazing [inaudible 00:27:07]. He does these really amazing abstract rodeo paintings. And I remember he was the first person that put me onto Basquiat, was like, &#8220;You should check out this artist.&#8221; And really just was amazed, of course, rightfully so. Basquiat was an amazing artist. But I think that being an artist, getting your hands dirty, the first time doing screen printing and stuff like that, I think looking back it did set a foundation of having that kind of different approach to things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What position did you play?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
I was first base but didn&#8217;t hit a lot of home runs and couldn&#8217;t hit a curveball to save my life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know. I think that&#8217;s just really cool that you were able to pursue this design degree and you were effectively also a college athlete. We&#8217;ve had college athletes and designers on here before, maybe not at that exact intersection. That&#8217;s pretty unique. I mean, out of the hundreds of interviews I&#8217;ve done, you are the first one I could say that has done baseball and graphic design. So that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Oh, thank you for that. Yeah, it was NAIA, which is basically division two. But one cool thing, though, is that we actually did play, in spring before we started league play we played in the Metrodome. They knocked it down years ago to build the new arena where the Vikings play. But playing in a Major League baseball stadium was cool. So that was really something I&#8217;ll keep with me for the rest of my life, even though we got destroyed and we actually were playing wood bats for the first time. So we&#8217;re playing wood bats against metal bats, so as you can imagine, we lost, and it didn&#8217;t work out so well. But it was still fun, though.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I mean, I&#8217;ve met you, you&#8217;re tall, so it helps to be tall as a first baseman.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Right, yeah. No, definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after you graduated, did you stay in North Dakota? What was the game plan after that?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Oh no, once I graduated I got a U-Haul. Had a truck at the time, put all my stuff there and drove back. And I moved back home to my folks and just trying to get a job but found it was really hard to actually find a job. Actually, couldn&#8217;t find a job. When I was in Minot, I first heard about AIGA and spent a lot of time in Minneapolis for it, and just loved the city there. I think I went to my first portfolio show there. And so, okay, I&#8217;m going to go to a portfolio show. I went to one at USC at the time and I believe Ed Fellows was the actual speaker at the time. Does amazing work.</p>
<p>And I remember when I was getting my book reviewed and one of the persons there was like, &#8220;You know, you really need to go to a place that&#8217;s going to teach you design.&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;If you develop that eye for design.&#8221; And he mentioned a couple different design schools. And so I researched it and was thinking about, I think, actually, Creative Circus and Portfolio Center. But I think I got a booklet or something from ArtCenter. And funny, living in Rialto, never actually heard of it before that time. And just visited the campus, fell in love. You know where they have the bridge, it&#8217;s this 1950s-style architecture and just all the amazing work that students did there. And I was like, &#8220;Okay, yeah, I want to be here.&#8221; Decided to attend ArtCenter.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. ArtCenter out in Pasadena. It&#8217;s a beautiful campus. I&#8217;ve been there once. I know the bridge that you&#8217;re talking about, though.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s weird now, though. They actually have bought&#8230; So there&#8217;s South Campus in South Pasadena, and so a lot of, I think&#8230; Graphic design has a big building there, illustration. So there&#8217;s still stuff on the bridge, the Hillside campus, but not as much as it used to be. But still really talented folks go there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How was ArtCenter different from Minot? Did you feel like because you had that four-year education already that it was easy?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
No. It was really intimidating. In other words, I remember in my initial class, people whose parents were designers, had done designs, had their own T-shirt companies and stuff like that. I&#8217;m sure like most folks you have imposter syndrome in your life, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, how am I going to cut it?&#8221; But a blessing was Jay Chapman is a creativity coach there. And I will always be in debt and love Jay for the rest of my life. Just an awesome person and he&#8217;s really all about just helping you get out your way and have a sense of play in your work. And just would visit him at the time. I remember would visit him for a project and it clicked for you. You think of ArtCenter, it&#8217;s great design but it could be kind of stuffy, I guess, in a way.</p>
<p>Think of Bauhaus. It&#8217;s really kind of beautiful design but sometimes inject some life into it. So Jay is complete opposite, where it&#8217;s ArtCenter, this amazing school, but surrounded by a bunch of rich houses. And you basically, most folks just stay on there and design and work and work and stress out. And where you have LA and all the different cultures and cities that make up LA right around you but don&#8217;t even experience it. So really just enjoying life and experiencing different things and then injecting that into your work. Once from that just really did that and that really helped open the doors for me there. Just really, okay, it&#8217;s not worrying about other&#8217;s story, but what are my experiences? What does my perspective look like? And really just going well with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it sounds like the combination of Minot and ArtCenter probably gave you a much stronger foundation once you got out there and worked as a designer. Because of course you had this foundational knowledge from Minot, but then as you mentioned, with ArtCenter, you&#8217;re learning about this sense of play as well as also probably learning about some different techniques and such that you didn&#8217;t get from a four-year college that you&#8217;re now getting at an arts college.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What was your early career like?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
After ArtCenter?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a great question. It&#8217;s funny thinking back. It&#8217;s funny, in design school, and it might be for the majors too, you&#8217;re taught basically the world&#8217;s your oyster, right? Designs going to save the world and work on these amazing projects. And so it was funny, my first actual project, at ArtCenter, they have what&#8217;s called, as part of your last day is speed dating. So different companies come to your spot where you&#8217;re presenting your work. Basically, you&#8217;re showing off, &#8220;Hey, this is the work I&#8217;m proud of from my time at ArtCenter. Hire me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, one of the people that did was someone from Saputo Design, which is an agency in Westlake LA. Or not Westlake LA but Westlake, California, excuse me. They&#8217;re a small ad agency and they were working on a pitch for K-Swiss. And I had some collage work in my portfolio from a project for my senior year. And they basically had me work on a freelance project with them for a little bit from that. So that was my actual first one. So that was cool, just like, &#8220;Hey, you liked the stuff I did for a class and able to use it for a pitch for a shoe company.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you started out doing visual design, right?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yep. After that, I was there, moved on to another place where a professor worked. And actually it was my first time being fired on the spot. And that was-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Whoa.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah. Of course, at the time I was not laughing at all. I remember basically was working on a branding project. I forgot what I did, but made a mistake and basically the person&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, thank you for your time, but kindly pack up your things and go.&#8221; I&#8217;m paraphrasing that. So, by the grace of God, I managed to say thank you, shake hands and head down to the lobby and that&#8217;s when I burst into tears. And I remember the security guard or someone down there, like, &#8220;Hey, are you okay?&#8221; And me just melting down, where it&#8217;s fresh out of ArtCenter, have, what, six figures in student loans?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still living at my parents&#8217; house. And how am I going to tell my parents and also my girlfriend, my now wife, at the time girlfriend, that, &#8220;Hey, I got fired.&#8221; Just feeling like a complete failure. But looking back, it&#8217;s one of the best things that happened to me just really because it really was my first lesson, a big lesson, that there&#8217;s no such thing as security. Things could change in the instant. Not in a way of being afraid of, &#8220;Oh, this could be gone,&#8221; but there&#8217;s some freedom of, &#8220;Okay, this happened but I&#8217;m still surviving. This is not going to end me. Yeah, it sucks right now, but I&#8217;m going to keep going forward.&#8221; And that&#8217;s definitely something that&#8217;s really helped me along the way, just because it&#8217;s tough finding a job at times. The design world especially is really small and it can seem like everything&#8217;s turning against you and things aren&#8217;t going to turn around. But if it&#8217;s not like being any smarter or talent makes you &#8220;successful.&#8221; But just sticking in there, getting back up and that&#8217;s really helped me in my career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m really glad you said that because I think designers now, particularly during this wild period of layoffs that&#8217;s happening in not just the tech industry but the design industry and others as well, I think it helps to just hear that. When this sort of stuff happens, it&#8217;s not the end of the world. It certainly can feel that way. But you have to find a way to bounce back from it. And I think it also helps, and maybe in this particular instance, to know that you&#8217;re not alone when this stuff happens. I mean, yes, it&#8217;s the ending of one thing, but it also has the potential to open up into new opportunities that you can do. So, after that happens, how did you pull yourself out of that?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
So, funny enough, you mentioned you&#8217;re not alone, and that was something that actually helped too. A friend of mine at ArtCenter, Megan, was working at a company called Guess Clothing Company. And so she mentioned me to her boss Hiro, and basically I forgot, it might have been a month or two after that. I&#8217;m wondering what the hell&#8217;s going to happen next. And Megan hits me up saying, &#8220;Hey, would you want to work at Guess?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Of course,&#8221; so I actually ended up working there for a little bit. And I went on from there to Live Nation/Ticketmaster. And Hiro&#8217;s been a boss that I&#8217;ve&#8230; He attended my wedding, someone I consider a really good friend and kept in touch with and still keep in touch with now and just helped, advice. It&#8217;s really just like you never know when things are going to change, but having those people around you that are rooting for you really helps you out.</p>
<p>It may not happen exactly then, but along the way in a little bit of time, things will really pan out where it&#8217;s like, oh, okay. I&#8217;ve actually worked with when he joined a different startup and was looking for work. And yep, &#8220;Hey, Breon, looking for work?&#8221; And &#8220;Hell, yeah, I am.&#8221; And so I joined that too. So I definitely think it helped later on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So for you, keeping that community in line is something that was really a good asset for you.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Definitely. I know I&#8217;m not alone in this too where just I hate asking for help. And it&#8217;s just being stubborn. Just, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m going to do it myself.&#8221; But you need help and asking for help is not a sign of weakness. And I think one of the best things too is turning it forward when you actually are in a position to help people out, be able to do that too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What inspired you to pursue product design? I mean, you were doing visual design and I see just from looking at your LinkedIn, you did UI/UX design. What brought you to product?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
So, back when I was at ArtCenter, there weren&#8217;t product design classes, or at least not for what we mainly consider it now. Product design as I knew it then was basically designing shoes or physical products or physical objects. So, I was actually, my specialization was in branding. So basically the idea of once you know, you do your research and your strategy and figuring out who you&#8217;re designing for, you can design whatever the hell you want to design. Whether that&#8217;s a logo, traditional stationary assets, things like that, or packaging, websites, you name it. So it wasn&#8217;t until I was working out in the field. I worked at Ticketmaster for about a year and just wanted to move to the Bay, where it still, it&#8217;s like that now, but it&#8217;s kind of awesome design place. It&#8217;s kind of like Starbucks, there&#8217;s one on every block pretty much.</p>
<p>And just wanted to really try to make a name for myself in the Bay. And so moved there. First learned about UI and then UX design and then later product design. And it was really from a point of trying to have more ownership on the project, where I went to the place, I was working as a UI designer. And it was the first time, once I moved back down to LA after a couple years. And it was the first time in my career where it just basically felt like it was a complete wrong fit. The design team overall was nice, friendly and whatnot. But the actual team I was working on seemed like basically didn&#8217;t really care, value my contributions to the team. And also from the company standpoint, the things we&#8217;re working on, we&#8217;re basically the red-headed stepchild of the company.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not really having the funding or developmental talent to work on what we&#8217;re doing. It was basically like that, where I was working as a UI designer, but basically just it&#8217;s like, okay, the UX person does the UX, does user testing focus, all that stuff, does even some mockups. And, &#8220;Okay, here you go, Breon. Make it look pretty.&#8221; And just not what I got into design for. So I ended up leaving and I did an online class at General Assembly on product design, or UX design, rather. And just wanted to see, is this something that I do? And I had worked alongside some in-house teams, really great UX teams, UX designers, and learned a lot during that. And really found out this is all stuff that I could do, just all the things I took from them and be able to apply it from there.</p>
<p>And so I did that online course, it was basically a month long. And after that, Hiro, my boss from Guess earlier in the years actually reached out, because he had moved to the Flex Company as a creative director there and was looking to build a design team there. And so he hit me up and that was actually my first UI product design-type role after that General Assembly class. So it kind of all snowballed there where I was working there, really great company, they&#8217;re really small, tight-knit. Got to know the head of marketing, Maytal there, a really great person. And she put me on to someone who she knew who was an entrepreneur, has his own company, is looking to actually rebrand the logo, the website and app. And so that was another project where actually applying what I applied from that General Assembly class to that. So it kind of all just, unbeknownst to me at the time, lit and connected to each other and just slowly but surely evolving to being able to apply what I was looking to do.</p>

And now that you&#8217;ve been working as a senior product designer at DEPT and you&#8217;ve been doing this work, do you feel like it&#8217;s been a natural evolution of your skills over the years?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah, I think so. There&#8217;s things from the branding side I definitely take in. As a product designer, you have design patterns you leverage. So think about, you open up your smartphone, buttons typically look the same, or different interactions or swiping and things like that, where they make sense because they&#8217;re something we&#8217;re all used to or trained to use. But there&#8217;s still a lot of design, a lot of digital products look the same. If you cover up a logo, it&#8217;s hard to tell what&#8217;s what.</p>
<p>And so I think from the branding side, that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s a chance to inject personality and experience into things. Not sacrificing the overall experience from a usability standpoint, but from a personality standpoint, how can you make an experience that really feels like this? So if you think of Apple products, where if it&#8217;s opening up your iPhone, the physical packaging to it, or looking at your iPhone or looking at the website or looking at things like that, it&#8217;s different things but it all feels the same. It feels like an overall same experience, so that kind of idea to it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, looking ahead, how do you see the field evolving in the years to come?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good question. I think rightfully so, there is some hesitation or the sky is falling there with ChatGPT or we&#8217;re talking about AI before. Where those things are real, but thinking about it, having read some stuff, it seems like that&#8217;s the natural order of things. So I imagine designers before were working with their hands, like calligraphers, when you have the setting presses, type presses were kind of the same thing for that. Like, &#8220;Oh no, what&#8217;s going to happen for us?&#8221; And then after that, fast-forward to the computer. And so thinking that same thing too. But it seems like all those things, yeah, they did take away some jobs, but it seems like the bulk of the jobs they took away were things or actions that you don&#8217;t like to do, the more repetitive things.</p>
<p>Where it feels like more of these being our assistants of sorts. Maybe if it&#8217;s for ChatGPT. ChatGPT, I know I use it for coming up with ideas for the copy for the website for Holiday Free Of I&#8217;m generating for copy. I&#8217;m not a copywriter, but at least, it&#8217;s not perfect, but having a place to start from or even really refining ideas I have. So, in that sense, almost a old school ad idea like the partners, you have a copywriter, AD paired together. So a team where it&#8217;s helping you generate ideas and work towards a common goal.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I use Chat GPT now, and I mentioned this before we recorded, I use it a bit like a writing partner. It&#8217;s good to give some prompts on some things and maybe help guide you in the right direction, but it&#8217;s certainly not a magic bullet. Although I feel like that&#8217;s how the media is certainly reporting on it. They&#8217;re sort of anthropomorphizing Chat GPT and similar types of things like, &#8220;Oh, they can think, they can hallucinate.&#8221; They can only do what they&#8217;re trained on based on the data that we give them. That&#8217;s just how it works. I mean, we taught rocks how to think and now we have computers, so what&#8217;d you expect?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
No, it&#8217;s spot on where they could do things, but the soul of what makes people people, that personality, at least not yet, it&#8217;s not easily repeatable by AI or machines. So, at least we got that going for us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is it that keeps you motivated and inspired these days?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Really just experiences. I think now when you typically think of a product designer, you think automatic like a phone or websites and apps and things like that. And that&#8217;s great, but I&#8217;m more interested in things that span mediums. Like going back to the cards, how do you create something that&#8217;s in experienced physically in your hands, but also digitally. But it may be slightly different, but carries along the actual same storyline you&#8217;re trying to tell. So things like that. Things like AR and VR, virtual reality, augmented reality. How do you really create meaningful experiences with that? I think that&#8217;s, at this point in my career, is really fascinating to me. Not so focused on the devices or the mediums, but more of these experiences or touchpoints for you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is the best advice that you&#8217;ve been given about design?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
I probably want to say it&#8217;s not even directly design related, but more of&#8230; And I&#8217;m not sure who I heard it from, but basically the point where it&#8217;s at one point in time everybody was a novice, or basically no one has all the answers. And I think that&#8217;s been really eye-opening just because when you&#8217;re coming up or just moving to something new, you think, &#8220;Oh, okay, they may have their ish together.&#8221; But a lot of times they don&#8217;t, or even at one point they didn&#8217;t. Even thinking about Web 3.0 or NFTs and all that stuff where no one has all the answers for it, so don&#8217;t feel like you have to be a &#8220;guru&#8221; or so much experience to know what&#8217;s going on there. Just having a sense of curiosity and playing around, asking questions, eager really to contribute to things. So it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s not this one elite path to doing anything it seems like.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Just my family. It&#8217;s wild even thinking of being almost 40 and having a family. And you can have bad days and just have things of being an adult, what makes being an adult tough, but still hearing my&#8230; My kids are still young enough where they&#8217;ll call for me and actually want to be around me and my wife. I know that&#8217;s going to change, especially when they&#8217;re teenagers, but that&#8217;s the most awesome thing where just people are super happy to see you and just that sheer look of happiness.</p>
<p>And just their laughter, their personality is so infectious too. I love to create things. I&#8217;ll create things till my last breath. My kids will be the most inspirational, best part of something I had a part of actually creating. And so that&#8217;s really a humbling and also a daunting challenge, but also just so rewarding, though, too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, your kids are also, at least the oldest one, probably, you say the oldest one is five, right?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yep.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is she at that age where she&#8217;s interested&#8230; I want to say interested in design, but I feel like kids, just the way that we structure things for them, they have so much time and freedom to just play and do creative stuff. Are you finding that she&#8217;s into painting and drawing and stuff like that?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s funny. My daughter Essie and my son Mackaye. Essie is super in singing and dancing. She loves to draw. Like Jackson Pollock work, just wild and chaotic with making marks and things like that, but also that freedom for it. So I&#8217;m not really sure what she&#8217;s going to do, but I think she&#8217;ll be a lot better at it than I am, just because just how passionate she is and just loving to sing and dance and just that freedom that she has. For my son, McKay, I&#8217;m not sure. He&#8217;s like the Tasmanian devil. He loves books. So I think they&#8217;ll do something maybe in the creative world somehow, or at least have those hobbies and things like that. I definitely won&#8217;t pressure them to do that, but I think there&#8217;s something there that they have from me, which I got from my dad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, you can pass on the legacy of design in a way.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Yeah, we&#8217;ll see. It&#8217;s wild, too, I wonder will there be a point in time in their lives when they&#8217;re older, will there still be jobs? Just how automated things are, it seems it&#8217;s not out of the realm of possibility where these things called jobs aren&#8217;t a part of our lives. But if that&#8217;s the case, what the hell&#8217;s going to fill that? So, I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
I think in a perfect world, if Holiday Free Of is something that catches on, and not even just that, but I think to a point where just I could survive off of my weird ideas and creating experiences and building a team potentially around it. Or actually, in January, last month, we&#8217;ll figure, I started teaching for the first time. And I had wanted for the longest time to teach, and just like a dummy feeling, &#8220;I have to be at a certain level of my career to actually teach,&#8221; which doesn&#8217;t make sense. And it&#8217;s been early, but I really get a lot of pleasure out of teaching. Early to see how, it&#8217;s a cheesy saying, but just if you want to learn something, teach. And just there&#8217;s so much that you have to do and learn just to be able to know what the heck you&#8217;re actually trying to teach.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like how do you actually communicate your ideas, and knowing enough to actually try to teach something, but knowing that you&#8217;re not going to know everything? So I&#8217;d love to do more of that. And just really too would like to be, when I think about my career, what I want to be, ultimately, I really think of a conductor, or just having an idea, but assembling talents to actually help them do their best by helping to overall steer the goal for it.</p>
<p>When I was working years ago back on my senior art show, I first heard about Duke Ellington and Count Basie. Amazing talents, but had these amazing bands built around them. And now if you think of Robert Glasper and the work he&#8217;s doing, I&#8217;d love to do something of that ilk where it&#8217;s maybe me creating my creative type of interests, like maybe a Nick Fury type of person, I guess, I think. Just really designing different things, even if it&#8217;s more like a sociological type study or things like that. Really just thinking about things or experiments and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The Design Avengers, I could see that. You could pull it off, though. You could pull off Nick Fury with the iPads. You could do it.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
Luckily, he doesn&#8217;t have hair, right? So I got that [inaudible 00:52:03].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
By the time this comes out, Holiday Free Of will be out. So I&#8217;m launching that. So you can check out Holiday Free Of on holidayfreeof.com. On Instagram it&#8217;s @HolidayFreeOf. For my personal portfolio, it&#8217;s breonwatersii.com. Personally on Instagram, I don&#8217;t do it that much, but [inaudible 00:52:35] politemanliness.com. And really just trying to do more things, really just more storytelling with that. So look out for some interesting things and experiments, explorations on Holiday Free Of.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Breon Waters II, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. Like I mentioned at the top of the episode, I think you had reached out to me several years ago and asked for my address because you wanted to send me a Christmas card. And I was like, &#8220;Yeah, sure, go ahead and send me a Christmas card.&#8221; And I mean, we&#8217;ve kept in touch since then. I&#8217;ve seen how your career has grown since then.</p>
<p>And also I think just hearing your story now and seeing the path that you&#8217;ve taken to get here, you&#8217;ve always struck me as someone that really has their eye on the prize, like you know what it is that you want to do and you&#8217;re steadily working and going towards that goal. So, I could see in five years, the cards really taking off and being a success. And I just want to thank you so much for the work that you&#8217;re doing, for continuing to blaze a trail in the industry, and just for being, I mean, to somebody like me, just being a positive influence in the industry, family man, doing the work that you&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s just good to see from this vantage point, somebody that&#8217;s really out there making their dreams happen. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Breon Waters II:</b><br>
That means the world, Maurice. Thank you so much, and thank you for your platform. Like I was saying before, the work you and Cheryl Miller, all different platforms that came out during 2020, like Where Are the Black Designers? It&#8217;s been a huge blessing for us, just knowing we&#8217;re not alone, there&#8217;s others like us. And just thank you for giving us a platform to share our stories and connect, so thank you so much for it.</p>

<p>It was a real joy to connect with Fungi Dube for this week&#8217;s episode of the podcast. She&#8217;s a skilled brand, web, and Webflow designer in Harare, Zimbabwe, and I love how she leverages her culture in her designs to create stunning visual and digital experiences for clients around the world.</p>
<p>We covered a range of topics related to design and creativity. Fungi shared the importance of understanding a client&#8217;s needs and goals, spoke about the creative community in Zimbabwe, and talked about how she transitioned from being a trained scientist to a talented designer. If you&#8217;re looking to find inspiration from within, then this interview with Fungi will definitely bring it to you!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
I am Fungi Dube. I am a brand visual and Webflow web designer based in Harare, Zimbabwe. I have been designing, according to LinkedIn, for almost eight years now. So I think that&#8217;s super cool. And I mostly am inspired&#8230; not mostly, largely inspired by the profound nuances that are embedded in African culture. So if you are to interact with my work or engage with my work online, you&#8217;re probably going to see that a lot of it is really centered on African narratives and seeing how I can tell their stories in a really fresh and inspiring way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So how has the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
The year has been good. I feel like at the very start of it, I was kind of flailing about, just trying to get everything in place and trying to organize myself personally, just getting my goals out there and that sort of thing. So it was a bit of a whirlwind, but as it has progressed, it&#8217;s gotten better. I feel like I am more in control. I&#8217;ve regained all balance and it&#8217;s been really good. I&#8217;ve been working on some super exciting projects that hopefully you&#8217;ll see the light of day soon. But yeah, so far so good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have any goals in particular that you want to accomplish for the year?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Definitely, definitely. I have a lot of sort of business-centered goals when it comes to being a solopreneur and running my own design brand, but I also have goals with regards to sort of tapping more into the design education space and seeing what I can do with that. So I do have two big, major self-initiated projects that I&#8217;m working on that I&#8217;m also funding that I&#8217;m hoping are going to work, and then I can go and ask people for money to make them bigger. But yeah, I definitely have a few things that I&#8217;m working on at the moment that I would like to see done by the end of the year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. I mean, I&#8217;d love to learn a little bit more about them, as much as you want to go into detail about them.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t want to keep it too generic, but pretty much the focus of these projects is that I feel that there&#8217;s a gap, and the gap is seen in how when it comes to African design systems or African design education or African inspiration in general when it comes to design is a little bit lacking. So you are able to find references and that sort of thing on Google. You could probably go outside and have a chat with a roadside vendor or with your grandmother and find out about things and that sort of thing, but I want to be able to at least contribute towards the documentation of some of these things. So there&#8217;s definitely a gap when it comes to the literature that we can read with regards to African narratives and how to implement them in design. So the project&#8217;s really one which is digital and one which is actually physical or centered on being able to start this documentation process, not only for designers now, but for designers to come.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds really interesting. I&#8217;d love to hear more about that once it&#8217;s out in the world.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Definitely. I&#8217;ll definitely let you in once there&#8217;s something to actually see.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, you just earlier described yourself as a solopreneur. Tell me just kind of more in general about your design work and what you specialize in doing.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if I should take the audience all the way back, but initially when I did start designing, I sort of was everywhere. So you could have told me to do, I don&#8217;t know, to design a flyer for the most random thing ever and I would&#8217;ve done it because I was still learning and sort of getting my feet or dipping my toes in the water just to see what the industry was like. But I want to say probably at the four-year mark of my seven plus, almost eight year journey, it sort of clicked that I wanted to be able to work on projects that I could see myself in as a young Black, Zimbabwean female African designer.</p>
<p>So I made the shift and my focus since then has been seeing how I can leverage African culture, African narratives, nuances that are embedded in African cultures like textures, colors, patterns, the use of graphic symbols as a way of visual and global communication, and just seeing how I can interpret that in a fresh, modern, and inspired way and send that out to the world. So that is the base or the foundation of the work, and then the sort of disciplines that I work within would be the brand design space, the visual design space, and more recently the Webflow design space.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I worked briefly, this was back from 2017 to 2020-ish, I worked for a company that was doing a lot of, not no code, low code, they really actually wanted to be more code, but we worked a lot with or kind of in congress with other companies that were doing those sort of similar things, like Webflow, basically taking the process of design and sort of democratizing it in a way where you could use a product to create things. I&#8217;ve used Webflow before. It&#8217;s super powerful. I love how you&#8217;re able to really create full, really fully functioning sites with just dragging and dropping. And if you want to get into the code you can, but I like that the code is not a hindrance in order for you to create something.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s really changed my perspective on design as well, because there&#8217;s just so much that you can do. So Webflow is super flexible, infinite possibilities when it comes to very unique user experiences and customizing really cool interfaces and animations and interactions. So yeah, it&#8217;s been a really cool journey so far. This would be my second year in Webflow, but I&#8217;m just super excited to really learn more about it and see what I can create with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So what does a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Goodness. Okay. So my routine has changed a little bit as the start of this year, but I used to be 5:00 AM club. I am not anymore. I have become 7:00 or 8:00 AM club, and that&#8217;s perfectly fine. So that&#8217;s the time that I usually wake up. I tend to have my little morning routine, so whether that&#8217;s cleaning my space, making my bed, taking a shower, having some breakfast, but I will be settled at my desk around 9:00 in the morning. I like to get administrative tasks out of the way first, so I check my emails, I check my socials. I am also a brand design coach with Flux Academy, so I tend to check all of those emails as well and see what&#8217;s happening in the community with the students. And then right after that, which is probably maybe an hour, an hour and a half, then I&#8217;ll dive into any kind work that I could be working on.</p>
<p>So I tend to also like to work in little sprints throughout the day. So I&#8217;ll dedicate an hour block or an hour and a half block to a certain task, and then I&#8217;ll move on to the next one. But with each and every single day, I do at least make sure that I prioritize time to go to the gym. So that&#8217;s usually in the late afternoon. And if I am able to, I also schedule nap and nap time because I think it&#8217;s important to recharge and occasional dance breaks. It&#8217;s so weird, but I have it in my schedule to be like, &#8220;Okay, I think that we need to just blast some tunes right now and just have a vibe at the desk,&#8221; so that things don&#8217;t get too hectic and you don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re losing your mind. So yeah, that&#8217;s pretty much what a typical day looks like for me. In the evenings after gym, dinner, shower, cup of tea, I&#8217;ll wind down and maybe watch something on Netflix, read something before I go to bed, and we start it all over again. But my workday is usually done around 10:00 PM in the evening.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love that you have these breaks in the day scheduled for play, or I would say for non-work, but you&#8217;ve got them scheduled in your calendar and you don&#8217;t move them around or anything. I love that.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Yeah, I think it&#8217;s super important to prioritize things such as help us to also relax as designers, because I think it&#8217;s super easy for us to be at our desks plugged behind our computer screens for 16 hours a day and you actually don&#8217;t realize that you&#8217;ve been working for so long. So I&#8217;m a strong advocate for making sure that&#8230; and balance looks different for everyone, I should add that, but just for ensuring that at least there&#8217;s a little bit of me time even in the chaos and the busyness of work. So even if it&#8217;s 20 minutes of just, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s do some chair dancing, or let&#8217;s take a quick nap,&#8221; I&#8217;m definitely going to take it for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I think it&#8217;s super important, especially when you&#8217;re a solopreneur, because nobody&#8217;s going to prompt you to do that. Nobody&#8217;s going to tell you, &#8220;Hey, maybe you should take a break.&#8221; You have to do it. You have to schedule it in in order to make sure that you get that done.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Yeah. And that&#8217;s the thing as well. When you&#8217;re a solopreneur, you have to wear many hats. So it can get really overwhelming and you find yourself sort of feeling a lot more burnt out and that sort of thing. So I had to be very intentional about ensuring that I scheduled this into my day-to-day so that at least I can cope with everything else that I have to do, because I have to be social media manager, I have to be accountant, I have to be administrator, designer, strategist, all in one. So just having that time to yourself where you can just do nothing or where you can play really, really, really makes a difference.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re starting a new project. It can be from a new client, from a current client. What does your creative process look like?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
From the jump, I like to have a discovery call. With any potential leads, I will write to them and just find out when they&#8217;re available for us to meet. I will introduce myself in this call. I will also listen to them talk about their brand/their business, their service, their product, what it is that they think they need for their brand, because sometimes you will actually find out that they may think that they need branding, but maybe they actually need a strategy first and that sort of thing. So once we&#8217;ve had that discovery call, then I follow that up with documentation and what this documentation is, depending on what sort of service they&#8217;re after. So whether it&#8217;s brand design, whether it&#8217;s web design, I&#8217;m just going to send them a questionnaire where they can then put all the words that we discussed in the call onto paper just as a form of reference for the both of us so that if I need to pick up any vital information and that sort of thing, then I know that I can always refer back to that document.</p>
<p>It also helps me to set a project proposal, which covers all of our working terms. So issues to deal with costing, with deliverables, with turnover times, just for general terms of engagement that allow for us to be happy as you go throughout, as we work on the project and that sort of thing. And then once that&#8217;s signed, sealed and delivered, then I will then start working on the project. So it&#8217;s very collaborative on my end, where I tend to also include and involve my clients in the project as much as possible. And so I set up a central workspace on Notion where we can exchange ideas, where we can shorten the feedback loop, where everyone has access to everything. So at any stage of the project they can see exactly what&#8217;s going on, they can see what assets are being created and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>So when it actually comes to the design process of it, I&#8217;m going to start off with the visual mood boarding phase, which is basically putting together or curating some reference images that capture the essence of the brand or how we are trying to get it to look like. Once that&#8217;s approved, then I go into development, which will obviously be very different depending on what the project is. So it could be the logo suite and then colors type, supporting assets like iconography, brand patterns, maybe illustrations to accompany some of the assets that have been created and that sort of thing. And then, I will iterate on that of which in my project proposal I also stipulate how many rounds of revision are allowed for the project depending on the price and everything.</p>
<p>And then once it&#8217;s happiness and joy, we&#8217;ve sort of worked through it, we&#8217;ve edited what needs to be edited, we&#8217;ve revised what needs to be revised, then I will hand over all the asset files to them, inclusive of all the high resolution formats, inclusive of the original source files, and obviously guidelines and that sort of thing as to how they should retain the integrity of the brand identity that we have just worked on together. And yeah, that&#8217;s it. So that&#8217;s sort of how I cycle through it, but it&#8217;s all also very, very, very, very heavily based on research. I think that probably takes me 80% of the time and then executing everything is like 20% of the time, because I want to make sure that I am obviously creating something that is distinct, something that&#8217;s memorable, something that&#8217;s competitive, but something that also captures the heart and the essence of their story. So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you find that clients often want skip that research step and they just want to go right into the creation part?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
I have had instances where that has happened, but it hasn&#8217;t been that often in the recent years. But if that has been the case, that&#8217;s been an immediate red flag because I think the discovery call has helped me to get a sense of whether they would be open to my process or not. So if we are on the call and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Hey, you know what? Let&#8217;s just skip over that. Don&#8217;t really matter. Let&#8217;s just design the logo and let&#8217;s go,&#8221; then I know almost immediately that that&#8217;s not going to work because there&#8217;s a lot more work that goes into the visuals or into the final outcome that people are then going to engage with. So it does happen. It has happened. It doesn&#8217;t happen as often now, but I mean, we are dealing with people at the end of the day, so everyone has a different way of thinking of how things should be done, so there&#8217;s that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve often found even when clients want to skip that step, it always extends the project because what ends up happening is you&#8217;re making something, you&#8217;re just jumping right into it, and then you have to do X number rounds of revisions, which I like that you put in, you stipulate, &#8220;I&#8217;m only doing this many revisions.&#8221; The research helps so you stick to that, so you&#8217;re not kind of doing this constantly iterating process of trying to appease the client without doing the research first so you can try to get it right the first two or three times as opposed to, &#8220;Here&#8217;s version 12 of what we&#8217;ve been working on.&#8221; No one has time for that.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Yeah, no one has time for that for sure. And what I actually wanted to add on to that is to say that when you find that you have clients who sort of jump the gun in that way or want to do that, it really takes away from the process in the sense that you&#8217;re saying you definitely will find yourself maybe having to go back to V1 or after you are at V7 of the project, and it&#8217;s really not going to benefit you and it&#8217;s not going to benefit them either, because I think there&#8217;s going to be a lot of frustration there.</p>
<p>Research really, really, really helps you to get to that point where also you are not designing according to your client&#8217;s preference, which is another thing that we need to mention, because they are going to have their personal taste and everything like that, which is fair and fine, and we should definitely consider that, but we need to understand that when it comes to these sort of branding and visual projects, we&#8217;re also designing together or to appeal towards a certain target market or audience. So that research is essential. It really ensures that, &#8220;Hey, when we push this out, are we going to be speaking to the right people and then are they going to take it the way that we intend for them to do so?&#8221; So if anyone is listening, and if your client or potential lead is like, &#8220;No, no, no, we are not going to do research. We are just going to skip through this,&#8221; then I will tell you to not take that project. It&#8217;s not going to be worth your peace of mind.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What are the best types of clients for you to work with?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
So I have had a broad range of individuals and small businesses and corporates that I&#8217;ve worked with, and I can&#8217;t even pin it down to who the best kind of client is because I think everyone comes with a different kind of energy and a different kind of vibe. But what I&#8217;ll say is that in general, some of the projects that I&#8217;ve really enjoyed working on with individuals or small businesses, startups, enterprises who really value the importance of storytelling in one way or another.</p>
<p>So if we&#8217;re on the call and off the bat they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, we started this in 1897 and it was because my grandmother did this and did that,&#8221; and you just get this wholesome story that they just tie together and they tell you the background of why they&#8217;re doing it and that sort of thing, immediately I get good vibes from that because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, this is going to be something good to work on because there&#8217;s a lot more meaning and there&#8217;s that strong emotional connection to what they&#8217;re doing as opposed to just selling a product.&#8221; So those have been that clash of individuals who come with that sort of energy and that value storytelling in one form or another have been some of the best project that I&#8217;ve worked on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;re in Harare, Zimbabwe. I&#8217;d love for you to just paint a picture for the audience. I would say our audience is probably largely in the US. What does the creative industry look like there? Is it centered around Harare? Just kind of give us a window into what the industry is like there.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
So I would say that it is. We do have another major city called Bulawayo. Harare is the capitol, and a lot of what happens on the creative scene definitely happens here. And what&#8217;s really exciting about this time that we&#8217;re in is that we&#8217;re in a season where the creative scene in Harare or in Zimbabwe in general is on the rise. So even when it comes to novel ways of expressing fashion, of expressing fine art, of expressing expressive photography, there have been some really cool live exhibitions that have happened. They&#8217;ve been very urban fashion and photography exhibitions and shows that have also happened in the most unlikely places as well, where you would see these sort of things. And it&#8217;s just been really exciting seeing how young Zimbabwean creators are really stepping up or really stepping into their own, are really honing their craft and are really thinking of new ways of expressing the ideas. So it&#8217;s on the rise. It&#8217;s on the rise. I&#8217;m hoping that it infiltrates and sort of starts to penetrate crowd supporters overseas, but there&#8217;s a lot, a lot, a lot of exciting things that are happening currently.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you been able to tap into a creative community where you&#8217;re at?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
So I am a part of creative communities, not just here alone. I think if anything, when it comes to more of the work that I do with regards to branding web, there&#8217;s definitely room for there to be something that sort of unites creatives who do the same thing that I do. But that is, it&#8217;s there, but it&#8217;s not there. I know that&#8217;s very vague, but it makes so much sense in my head. I think there&#8217;s definitely room to see where that can go and what can be done with regards to that, but in terms of just general design communities and stuff like that, I am a part of and have had the wonderful opportunities to connect with other African creatives on the continent who are based in different cities to me. So that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been able to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I think if the creative scene is on the rise, like you mentioned it, it kind of I guess would make sense that there&#8217;s maybe not a lot of creative groups yet because things are still, it&#8217;s in that sort of burgeoning state where stuff&#8217;s beginning, stuff&#8217;s starting to pop off, stuff is starting to gain attention and gaining traction. So it&#8217;s probably just the visibility thing I would imagine at this point because yeah, I think it might just be a visibility thing. I&#8217;m completely guessing. I have no idea what it&#8217;s like in Zimbabwe, but I just know usually when I&#8217;ve talked with other people in other cities all across the world, when they&#8217;ve had those sort of small design spaces or creative spaces that are starting to pop up, the community just hasn&#8217;t coalesced yet around something. So I think as the scene rises, those types of things will happen. I think you&#8217;ll be able to find some community there, but it&#8217;s good, like you said, that you&#8217;ve been able to find it elsewhere, too.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
And I agree with you. I think it&#8217;s definitely a visibility thing for sure, but it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re slowly breaking into. But yeah, everything in strides, I would say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, let&#8217;s learn more about you as a person. I know you kind of gave us a hint into your kind of daily creative routine, but I&#8217;d love to hear more about you growing up. Were you really into design and art as a kid? Tell me more about that.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
So I always enjoy talking about my childhood. It&#8217;s a very special, special time for me. I grew up with what I would say were liberal parents in the sense that they let me explore. So both my parents were vet surgeons and we lived in a very small town here in Zimbabwe called Norton. It&#8217;s very nice, it&#8217;s very peaceful there. So I say liberal in the sense that whenever my parents went out on site visits, whether it was to farms for vaccinations and that sort of thing, they sort of let me wonder often see what I could find. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s dangerous or not, but they kind of let me do it, to the point that on one of my site visits with my dad, I sort of snuck into an ostrich pen and I saw a massive ostrich egg, and I surprised my dad when he got home and he was like, &#8220;What is that? When did that happen?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;well, listen, you kind of let me wander off, so that&#8217;s what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I do find that even from that, it really sort of opened up my mind in terms of how I thought and what I did. So I spent a lot of time outside. I built a lot of sandcastles, I played with dirt, I built things with sticks. So because of that, even when I then started going to primary school, I&#8217;m not sure what you would call it, but when you&#8217;re maybe six years old and you start going off to school, so we call it primary school, I found myself also taking time out to make special DIY cards for my family members at that young age for special occasions. So if my aunt had a birthday, if my cousin had a birthday, I would draw my favorite cartoon characters on the front of the card, just a blank sheet of paper, fold it in half, draw my favorite characters, color them in and give that to them as a birthday card.</p>
<p>So I think the creative sort of inclinations and the creative bone or creative DNA has been there from the time that I was born really, but I didn&#8217;t know that I could actually sort of capitalize on it or I could really bring it in and do something with it, which is why, like you mentioned earlier, as you were talking before this, that I went on to study science instead of anything creative. So instead of anything design related. I think maybe it probably worked as well because my parents essentially would&#8217;ve been in the scientific field because of the veterinary surgery and all of that. So it made sense for me to also do something in line with that or try and go into the scientific field.</p>
<p>But yeah, I kind of realized it much later after I graduated. I was like, &#8220;Wait, okay. There&#8217;s this thing called design and I could probably take it up and let&#8217;s see where it goes.&#8221; But again, I wouldn&#8217;t say that it&#8217;s something that I really thought of. It happened also in a very freakish way because after I graduated from university in 2014, I was job hunting for six months at the start of 2015, and I couldn&#8217;t find anything anywhere. I put my CV in the most random corners of the world and nothing came up, and I was so frustrated and I had no idea what I was going to do.</p>
<p>So in order to curb my frustration, I decided that I needed to teach myself a new skill. But even how design came about, again, maybe it&#8217;s divine order, maybe it&#8217;s something in the universe, I don&#8217;t know what it is. I was on YouTube and my top recommended video was a Photoshop tutorial. And it&#8217;s so weird, Maurice, because I had never heard of Photoshop before and I had never remotely&#8230; you could be like maybe the algorithm was doing things or whatever, but I had not even searched anything that is even closely linked to anything to do with Photoshop. So it was so weird. I just kind of clicked into it and my mind was blown because I was like, &#8220;Wait, are you telling me that people can actually do this with your computers and people make money from this and it&#8217;s a whole thing that you can do?&#8221; It was so bizarre to me.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s how it sort of started, and I started self-learning in design, and I also happened to get a full-time job that I started going to towards the middle of May in education. So I worked in education for six years with children age between 6 and 12 years old, and I was in the sports and coaching and conditioning department at the school, so in line more with the human physiology part of what I studied, but I was learning design on the side. I would go to work and come back and be like, &#8220;Wait, what can I learn today? Let me pull up another YouTube tutorial.&#8221; And at the time, I had a jet engine of a laptop and I had cracked Photoshop.</p>
<p>So yeah, I don&#8217;t know if the audience would be familiar with this, but maybe it&#8217;s going to show my age, too. But it was a time of torrents as well, so you could sort of download the torrent for Photoshop. Yeah, so that&#8217;s what I did, and it just kind of stuck and I loved it, and I just kept going with it, up until eventually I left my job at the end of 2020. I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be a full-time creative solopreneur,&#8221; and it&#8217;s been one hell of a ride ever since then.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think there&#8217;s certainly going to be a good bit of our audience that relates to using a cracked version of Photoshop to start learning about how to design. That&#8217;s how I started up. I was using a cracked version of Photoshop, and I was going to a local bookstore, and I mean, I&#8217;m dating myself now. This is early&#8230; not early, maybe mid-2000s or so, 2004, 2005. Because there used to be these books published about Photoshop, like Photoshop 6: Dirty Tips and Tricks, and it would show you all these different little effects that you could make. &#8220;This is how you make a metal effect. This is how you make a gold effect. This is how you make a water effect.&#8221; And I didn&#8217;t have the money to purchase those books because those things were $50. I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have $50 to buy this book, but what I can do is write down all the steps in my notebook and take it back home, or I could take a picture,&#8221; because I had this little dinky point and shoot camera, and I would take a picture of the page and just go back home and download the pictures and have the picture up, and then have Photoshop up and try to mimic the steps and stuff. So I mean, that&#8217;s how you learn. It&#8217;s that hands-on kind of stuff. So I completely, completely understand where you&#8217;re coming from there.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, it&#8217;s a real life case of trust the process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. When you look back at your time in college, you were studying human anatomy, physiology, biochemistry. In hindsight, did you see any elements of design in that work?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Yeah, actually, because now, especially when it comes to maybe my research methodology just for creative projects, I see that I borrow a lot from what I learned during that time. So even when it comes to general experiments, obviously you&#8217;ve got to know what sort of equipment you&#8217;re going to use. You got to know what you need in order to get a certain result, you&#8217;re going to have to evaluate that result. Maybe you&#8217;re going to have to redo things and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>So that entire process of being able to design an experiment, I think is the same thing that I use now when it comes to coming up with concepts for brands. The research part of it definitely comes from there, because I can read any sort of, what may seem very boring content, especially within my line of work and my influences. I probably need to also read research papers, see what other maybe anthropologists or just historians have come up with regards to a certain topic. So that&#8217;s pages and pages of just literature, and I blur through that with ease. It doesn&#8217;t even feel like anything to me because I think just having been trained in a specific way when it came to my formal education really has helped a lot, and more so even when it comes to coming up with solutions and dissecting briefs and that sort of thing, I see a lot of my scientific background coming to play there. In hindsight, I&#8217;m definitely grateful for it because I think it&#8217;s made me a better creative and it&#8217;s also made me a better problem solver and a better thinker. So yeah, I definitely see how the two roles come together to form something quite beautiful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s great that your scientific background influences your approach because we were talking earlier about research. If you were a doctor or you just try to diagnose someone or just jump right in without doing research, you would not be a good doctor. So similarly, it&#8217;s the same way with design. You have to do that research to know, &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the best approach? How do I know the best way to tackle this particular thing?&#8221; As you mentioned that, it just reminded me of what I&#8217;ve went through as a math&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say a mathematician, but my degree as a math. I didn&#8217;t study design professionally. I just studied as a hobby and managed to turn it into a career. And when I look back even at the times where I was drawing 3D graphs by hand on a chalkboard or trying to create certain graphs and functions in mathematical or whatever, tessellations, fractals, et cetera, there&#8217;s design in those elements, too. There&#8217;s a lot of design in math that I don&#8217;t think probably, I don&#8217;t want to say traditional designers, but I think most designers probably don&#8217;t look at math that way. It&#8217;s funny, I even mentioned it and folks are like, &#8220;Ugh, math, I hate math.&#8221; And I mean, I like math.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t blame them. I don&#8217;t blame them. It&#8217;s math [inaudible 00:36:14]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I mean, I think what math does, and probably similarly to what you have went through studying anatomy and physiology and biochemistry, it gives you a different way to process information. So for you, it&#8217;s really about making sure that you have that thorough research to execute the designs in the right way. When I think about math, math really taught me how to structure my thinking and that I&#8217;ve been able to use in proofs, in proposals, in any sorts of things when it comes to getting that message across succinctly to a client or something like that. So for designers out there that are like, &#8220;Ugh, the sciences,&#8221; don&#8217;t rule out the sciences. There&#8217;s ways that you can tie these things together.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Yeah. And it&#8217;s actually so interesting, because like you&#8217;re saying it really shapes your process and how you dissect creativity in general. I&#8217;ve had the most interesting conversations. I feel like some of the most interesting conversations I&#8217;ve had are obviously with you right now because this is very enlightening, but also with people who have made career pivots, so accountants who are now creatives or medical doctors, which is so crazy, who are now creatives or engineers who are now creatives. And also just looking into their process and how they do things and how even the final outcome looks. It&#8217;s so interesting, because you see how based off of the different professional backgrounds or the different educational backgrounds, the process is just going to be entirely different, but the outcome is going to be just as beautiful. Sorry. So it&#8217;s just really interesting just seeing how people merge all these different worlds and then just come up with this solid body of creative work. It&#8217;s fascinating to me, absolutely fascinating.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What do you want our audience to know about, I guess, design in Zimbabwe? What do you want them to know about, whether it&#8217;s the work that you see coming out of it, other creatives that you know that are kind of on the rise? What do you want to let our audience know about that?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Oh, gosh, there&#8217;s so much. I just wish that this was a video presentation and I could show you some of the work because it&#8217;s so good. But I think if anything, there&#8217;s a shift. There&#8217;s a shift, and I definitely want to speak on this, but not in greater detail because that&#8217;s not why we are here. But I think there has been a lot of external imposition on what creative work looks like or should look like based off of history and colonization and everything that has happened.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s this massive shift where what we are trying to do is to decolonize design in the sense that we want to say, &#8220;Hey, design can actually look like this, and that&#8217;s perfectly fine. Photography can look like this, and that&#8217;s perfectly fine.&#8221; So if anything, like I was referring to earlier, within the creative scene in Zimbabwe, there is definitely a lot that is coming up and on the rise, but even as you engage with the visuals, when you engage with the patterns, with the colors, with the execution, and I spoke of how you have these fashion shows that are being done in the most unlikely locations, you see that there&#8217;s definitely this big drive to ensure that the work is great, but also the way that the work is executed and the way that people engage with the work is unlike anything that we&#8217;ve seen before.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s really, really exciting just seeing how more young Africans are stepping into their own really claiming and owning their identity and are just saying, &#8220;Hey, this may be a lot for people to take in. Maybe it&#8217;s too African, maybe it&#8217;s just too much energy, but it&#8217;s fine because this is who we are and we want to be able to tell our story the way that it should be told.&#8221; So yeah, it&#8217;s fun times ahead, fun times ahead. Fun times ahead. Let&#8217;s look into the future. Two years from now, five years from now, I believe that Zimbabwe and Zimbabwean creativity and Zimbabwean design is going to be on a whole other level.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you consider to be your biggest success in your design career so far?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
I am going to go more on the qualitative route, where I feel like my biggest success has been the chance and the opportunity to be able to connect with other creatives who are like me and have them sort of recognize themselves in the work that I do. I could easily say something like, &#8220;Oh, I worked with a client who paid me X amount, or I did this and that,&#8221; but I think that just the sense of community is something that has really, really, really, really impacted me the most.</p>
<p>I get so much joy when I&#8217;m able to talk to, or someone who&#8217;s just an up and coming designer or thinking of design, and they&#8217;re based maybe in Kenya or they&#8217;re based in Burundi, and they just write me a message on social. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Hey, I saw your work and I just absolutely feel really inspired that I can actually sort of tap into my own culture and see what I can come up with,&#8221; and that sort of thing. And that is something that really, really, really, really, like I can wake up every day to that and not get paid a single dime and I&#8217;ll be fine. So that has been my biggest success, my biggest achievement, and I want to see how I can continue to build on that and see how I can continue to hopefully inspire and encourage other young African creatives to really step up and showcase your work and showcase their heritage, their culture, your tradition, and just take that to the global market. So yeah, that&#8217;s it for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve mentioned, I read this as I was sort of doing my research, you mentioned that you find inspiration from within when it comes to your work. Can you talk with me a little bit more about that? How do you build that sort of internal fortitude? How do you build that?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
So it hasn&#8217;t always been there, and I should be very honest about that because I think that as we were growing up and also the public education system that we&#8217;re exposed to, a lot of what we were taught doesn&#8217;t really resonate with who we are. So I probably at that point knew a lot more about Western history than I did about my own history, and I think that is something that needs to be fixed. So the resolve, I guess, or the tenacity has really come from wanting to do more when it comes to that. And I sort of had my light bulb moment when I encountered a book by well known as Zimbabwean graphic designer, but he&#8217;s also known in the international community. His name is Professor Saki Mafundikwa. He actually went to school in New York, I believe. So he studied there, and then he came back and he started the first graphic design school here in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also given a TED Talk, and in his TED Talk he talks about looking for inspiration within. So after encountering his book, which is called African Alphabets, I was completely blown away because again, it comes back to that whole issue of documentation where I didn&#8217;t really know that it was possible to document African design systems in the way that he did. And it&#8217;s mostly based on typography and it&#8217;s absolutely fascinating stuff. So if anything, that&#8217;s where the initial point of contact or inspiration came from, and it just made so much sense to me because I had sort of been lost in this design world where I was doing anything and everything. And I&#8217;m sure you can attest to this as well, when you start out, you do everything. You&#8217;ll do your company profile, you&#8217;ll do a brochure, you&#8217;ll do a flyer, a poster, doesn&#8217;t really matter what the subject matter is.</p>
<p>I mean, it does, don&#8217;t get me wrong, because people will be like, &#8220;Hey, what kind of things were you designing?&#8221; But not in that sense. But that point gave me a sense of direction and really inspired me to be like, &#8220;Hey, actually we can flip this thing around. Let&#8217;s take all of these fundamentals that we&#8217;ve learned and convey them into a message that I would actually want for people to engage with and a message that I would want to see myself in.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I guess that is where that internal resolution has come from, and it&#8217;s been the driving and motivating factor ever since then to be like, &#8220;What can I do today? What can I do different? How can I take this story that people may have perceived in this way or this narrative and turn it into something that&#8217;s Afro-positive?&#8221; Because there are a lot of stories, there are a lot of things that I see about who we are and what we do and where we eat and where we live and that sort of thing and the world may see us a certain way, but I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, actually, if we take power and we actually tell our story the way that it&#8217;s supposed to be told, then there&#8217;s so much more that we can actually get out of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>So really the looking within is to say as much as I can go out and seek inspiration online, on Pinterest, on [inaudible 00:46:11], what is in my backyard? Because when you look at the global and historical context, even between the two of us, we may share the same skin color, but when it comes to our historical context, our global context, there&#8217;s absolutely no way that you would be able to design like a designer who is in Harare, Zimbabwe, when you&#8217;re in Atlanta, Georgia. It&#8217;s just different.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s where really the looking within comes into be like, &#8220;Hey, what am I exposed to? What do I see on a daily? What sort of conversations can I have to seek inspiration? Can I go and speak to an outside vendor and find out how he weaves his basket? Can I have a conversation with my grandmother about how she designed her mud hut kitchen and all the paintings and murals that are on the outside?&#8221; Things like that really, really make a difference because you actually start to see that there&#8217;s creativity in a lot of the crafts that I see around me, and how can I leverage that? What can I draw from their processes as well, and how can I turn that into this fresh thing and tell it in a different way for everyone else on the internet to interact with? So that is really where it comes from.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At this stage of your career, how do you define success?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Ooh, that is a loaded question, now, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is it?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Yeah, because I&#8217;ve really got to think about it. But I think at this stage, what I think is really cool and what I&#8217;m really grateful for is the fact that even in interactions where I may not be there, so whether it&#8217;s physical spaces, whether it&#8217;s calls, it&#8217;s the fact that people are able to sort of recognize my work, and I think that&#8217;s so cool.</p>
<p>I get humbled every single time when I go on LinkedIn and someone will maybe tag me or mention me and be like, &#8220;Hey, is this your work?&#8221; And I&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Oh, no, it&#8217;s not my work, but I think that it&#8217;s so cool that you think that it could be my work.&#8221; So that really, really, really, really inspires me and motivates me to keep going. Just the fact that I&#8217;m in a position where people tend to think of me when it comes to a certain style or when it comes to a certain interpretation of design, I think it&#8217;s super cool. So that is one of my proudest moments, I think, and I&#8217;ve been working hard at it, so I&#8217;m glad that it&#8217;s paying off.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to any aspiring designers out there that maybe want to sort of follow in your footsteps? What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
This is going to sound so cliche, but I think the thing is to just go for it. I have come to learn that there are beautiful things that grow when you step outside of your comfort zone. It&#8217;s not the easiest thing to do, but I think that if you put yourself in a position where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, this is a little bit crazy, it&#8217;s a little bit scary. I have absolutely no idea how I am going to pull this off, but I&#8217;m going to go for it,&#8221; which is sort of what I had to do.</p>
<p>So I spoke of leaving my job, but I was sort of unsafe, like unfairly dismissed. In pandemic year in 2020 was the most heartbreaking experience ever. And I was kind of left thinking, &#8220;Whoa, what am I going to do with this thing and how am I going to make money and how am I going to take care of myself,&#8221; and everything like that. But you realize that certain doors get shut and they get shut in the most uncomfortable way ever because they&#8217;re sort of pushing you to get to the next thing, to start working on the next thing.</p>
<p>So if anything, if it feels a little bit scary, if it feels like you have absolutely no idea how you are going to do it, then I would encourage you to go for that thing because you never know what&#8217;s going to come out of it. But I mean, go with it. Go in it, sorry, having a plan of sorts. It may not be something that&#8217;s super solid, but at least make sure that you work on your strategy, make sure that you know what it is that you want to be doing and where you&#8217;re going to be doing it and who you&#8217;re going to be doing it with. Write all of that down and see if you can break it down into actionable steps and then see how far you can push it. But that really would be my advice. If you want to make a career pivot, too. I mean, former mathematician who says that he doesn&#8217;t want to call himself a mathematician and former scientist-ish over here. So if you also want to transition, if you want to go over the bridge, it&#8217;s never too late. You can always do that, as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want your next chapter to look like?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Oh, I love this. I definitely see myself in design education. So as we have been talking, I&#8217;ve been talking about documenting processes and that sort of thing, and I am grateful that I&#8217;ve already sort of started dipping my toes in design education when it comes to my mentorship and my coaching role with Flux Academy. So we work with brand&#8230; we work with students across the world to enroll for various design programs, and one of them happens to be a brand design program. So I sort of offer them support with that. I offer them feedback as they go through their modules and everything like that. It&#8217;s a very diverse group of students, as young as 20, as old as 70. So it&#8217;s very interesting seeing what that is like, but it really feels like sort of the next step for me because I really want to see myself more in the African design education space. So can we have more design curriculum? Can we have more design curriculum that is geared towards African creatives? Can we get more literature? Can we get more books? Can you get more additional platforms that help African students learn about design and a more African aesthetic? Things like that. So that&#8217;s definitely where I would want to see myself five years from now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
I am everywhere except for TikTok because it scares me. I have a burner account on TikTok where I just follow amazing people, but the comments section scares me there. So you can always find me on my website, so fungidube.com, or my social links are also on my website, so you can find my Behance, you can find my Twitter, you can find my Instagram. You can also find my LinkedIn there, but it&#8217;s fungidube.com.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Fungi Dube, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. One, I think it&#8217;s awesome that you can give us just a window into what it&#8217;s like being a creative solopreneur in Africa, in Zimbabwe, giving us a sense of what that looks like. But also, just thank you for sharing your story about just determination and passion and how you&#8217;ve been able to really cultivate that creative engine within to create great work and showing people that you don&#8217;t necessarily have to go down a specific path, no pun intended for the name of the show, but you don&#8217;t have to go down a specific path in order to become a creative, be a creative, and even to leverage your own culture in the work that you do. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Fungi Dube:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me. This has been so much fun, now.</p>

<p>Maintaining authenticity is an important part of every creative&#8217;s journey, especially as you move up the ranks and gain more experience. But does it come at a cost? That certainly came up during my conversation with the highly acclaimed designer Ube Urban. Ube defines a space that is unclear &#8212; the innovation space &#8212; but he&#8217;s learned to wield that in his favor and now he&#8217;s on the lookout for his next opportunity.</p>
<p>Ube explained more about what he does, going in-depth with how he first got involved in design and how he works with brands. He also shared his story about growing up in Hawai&#8217;i, moving to California for college, and how his early entrepreneurial journey as a creative in San Francisco eventually brought him to Atlanta. We also spent some time talking about how he maintains his authentic self in an industry that often forces you into a box. Ube is so much more than his profession, and I think by the end of this conversation, you&#8217;ll see that too!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Hello everyone. This is Ube Urban, and I&#8217;m a customer user experience either director, practitioner, and chameleon within the customer experience space and digital transformations.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, just to I think level set a bit for the audience, and we&#8217;ll probably go into this later. But what is customer experience? What does that mean?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Customer experience is kind of, here&#8217;s another buzzword for you. The phy-gital experience. So physical and digital, omnichannel experiences. So really focusing on each individual point where a customer may interact with the brand, whether through social channels, going to a website. Or even going through some type of service, whether it&#8217;s a buy flow, creating an account, and what have you. Basically, you&#8217;re looking at the efficiencies and/or pain points, and trying to create opportunities from that to create a holistically better and hyper personalized experience. And this is done through many other ways that we can unpack later.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now when you and I last talked, you were working at a company, Simon-Kucher &#038; Partners, I think is what it&#8217;s called. How&#8217;s that been going?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going great. We officially separated. So yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I guess it is great. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;It&#8217;s great. I&#8217;m no longer working there. It&#8217;s wonderful.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Hence the tone in my voice may seem more joyful, and relaxed, and even keel, and less anxiety in the background. And it was for the best choice of both of us, having that leadership support and buy-in. Also trying to meet goals within a year. I mean, at the digital space, if you ask anybody, it&#8217;s pretty much like dog years. So in your first year, you pretty much have to create any type of game changing go-to-market strategies with these unrealistic expectations.</p>
<p>But at the same time, you&#8217;re just up for the challenge. You think you can meet and exceed that. But given the amount of time giving how you unpackage processes and methodologies, culture within an organization, it&#8217;s very difficult. Especially shifts in org, so this is very problematic within the space. Everybody is moving jobs. Your leaders are changing probably anywhere from one to maybe even three times a year. And this is not necessarily healthy not only from myself, but the people that you interface with and lead.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of fluctuations in morale, and it&#8217;s really hard when your job is on the line. Bot because of what you do as a practitioner and what you bring to the table, but rather if you&#8217;re a useful resource, a number. &#8220;What can you do for me? Do I like you? Can we interface? Can you opt into my swim lanes of success? And it&#8217;s usually sink or swim. Are you the gatekeeper of your success? Not anymore.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So what do your current days look like now? What kind of work are you doing just in general?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
My current days, the separation is very fresh. So it&#8217;s going back to the pastures, and seeing the grass is greener. And whether I want to go into pixel pushing and being a quintessential user experience, user interface designer within the tech space. Or do I want to lead and build another department. There&#8217;s a lot of open-ended questions and instant gratifications. Yes, of course I want to go back into my designer years.</p>
<p>But to be honest, I know too much behind a curtain. So it&#8217;s hard to have that niche aperture to put on my blinders. I cannot do it, because I&#8217;m exposed to so many different aspects of the professional space. And not only as the design space as a collection, but more of the business, who you have to interface with, the different dialects that you have to speak. Cultivating the relationships in order to really bring up your sense of self, your accountability, and basically the reach you have within an organization or clients. And this has everything and nothing to do with the reason why I got into being an artist or a designer.</p>

I know what you mean. I think when you get to a certain stage in your career, you&#8217;ve just seen too much. You know how the sausage is made, you&#8217;re not interested. And I mean it&#8217;s too much in that it sort of prevents you from really getting into the work, because now there&#8217;s all these other things that you have to contend with, that don&#8217;t have to do with the work as you&#8217;ve mentioned. That can impede your performance, your progress, what you&#8217;re able to accomplish, etc. Yeah. I feel you. Especially in a space that changes as much as design and technology do, particularly the tech space. I mean the tech space over the past, six months has been the red wedding, Game of Thrones. Every week, I&#8217;m hearing 10,000 people are laid off from these companies and it&#8217;s like, geez, what does that-</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
What are all these new openings here? And you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Because the work doesn&#8217;t disappear just because they laid these people off. So it&#8217;s an odd time. So I get what you mean about just slowing down and trying to figure out what the next move is going to be. Because look, the older you get, it ain&#8217;t too many more moves you can make. That same bounce back doesn&#8217;t get easier. I would say one, the older you get. And two, just the more that you get into it, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay. What do I want the next thing to be?&#8221; Now you&#8217;ve been occupying what you call the innovation space for the past five or six years now. How do you define that?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Innovation is not innovative anymore. When I self-reflect and look back, let&#8217;s just say on revisiting my CV, innovation just doesn&#8217;t mean what it is today. And what I mean by that is when you&#8217;re working on an initiative and you&#8217;re doing something that is unheard of, at least within let&#8217;s just say the direct to consumer, even retail space. And you&#8217;re doing heat tracking, you&#8217;re doing eye gazing, you&#8217;re doing everything that Nestles under machine learning and computer vision. It feels like you&#8217;re basically trendsetting that particular space.</p>
<p>But when six months go by or even to a year, and it feels that everybody&#8217;s on that bandwagon, where you could do a quick Google search and find research segmentation of various customer markets and how they use it, or how larger companies are using this type of technology within their flagship stores. It&#8217;s not innovative anymore, it&#8217;s just part of the work. It&#8217;s business as usual.</p>
<p>Innovative spaces is basically trying to nurture and shift with the customer and what the behavior is ,of what they&#8217;re interfacing at that given time. Platforms shift in so many different ways depending how you&#8217;re using it. Basically having a computer in your back pocket, we&#8217;re used to that. We&#8217;re used to doing every single thing that we can do on a computer, on our phones. Let alone you have an iPad, or you have a desktop setup or what have you. So we are basically spoiled by all these experiences, and basically selling our digital footprint and souls to a lot of these organizations.</p>
<p>So this is something also that we didn&#8217;t really talk about. We&#8217;re kind of skimming the surface of what it meant to have privacy, what it meant to start to establish trust. If we&#8217;re starting to peel back the layers and find out a lot more about one particular person, or even thousands of people. Are people with basically selling their digital souls for hyper personalized experiences? It&#8217;s very controversy. And no matter where that landscape goes, people are always thinking about it.</p>
<p>Where&#8217;s my data? Where&#8217;s my work landing? What server is it on? If it&#8217;s in the cloud, what does that mean? Is it safe? Where are my archives at? What is attached to my name? If somebody&#8217;s trying to extract and just find out a little bit more about you, is that information correct? There&#8217;s so many different outliers and things to consider, especially within the umbrella of innovation.</p>
<p>So innovation, it was a word that you could use for anything that didn&#8217;t have a set definition. User experience UI. Organizations still don&#8217;t know what these practitioners really do and what they can bring to the table. But you can lump that under innovation practices because it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, we have people that are basically jack of all trades.&#8221; They&#8217;re chameleons, they&#8217;re entrepreneurs. That&#8217;s usually the newer way of, &#8220;Hey, you have so many different traits. And interest in your background, here, we&#8217;ll just slap this buzzword on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So as I went through it at the time in this trend setting space, and trying to basically peel back these layers of what identity was within the technological space, it was very interesting. But as it became pretty much shifting into the status quo, it&#8217;s hard to make something compelling and different.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You said innovation is not innovative anymore. I felt that. That is so true. I mean, I think to even your earlier point about these new considerations around privacy, and where our data is going, and things like that, I think if there&#8217;s anything in the past few years have taught us is that people, while they are concerned about what company is selling their data, they&#8217;re also giving it away freely.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think over the past few months, the biggest topics in tech&#8230; I feel like our intersections of technology and culture have revolved around AI generated art, ChatGPT, etc. And it&#8217;s like yes, it is these artificial intelligence things, these language models that are outputting this stuff. But it&#8217;s only as good as what we give it or what we use for it. The AI art is pulling from stuff that is already publicly available on the internet. The ChatGPT stuff is pulling from the immense corpus of text that&#8217;s already available online.</p>
<p>Now granted, I think when the web and the internet were first created, especially as they got popularized, that&#8217;s not something that we even considered, as people started sharing stuff. I remember vividly the age of &#8220;user generated&#8221; content, the whole Web 2.0 era. People could not put enough stuff willingly online. Videos, photos, location. I mean, Foursquare? People ain&#8217;t doing Foursquare no more. You mean to tell me I could track exactly where I&#8217;ve been, and where people are, and congregating? That shit is now a huge security risk. So it&#8217;s interesting now that the innovation space has shifted and changed as technology has improved.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
And then we go into instant gratification. This piggybacks off of all the behavior of these data breaches and basically providing all this information. You have a driver&#8217;s license, you have a credit card. You have PreCheck to fly. You&#8217;re basically selling your whole background just to have a better experience. But this means you&#8217;re giving your fingerprints. You have your mugshot. You&#8217;re basically getting a background check pulled.</p>
<p>And a lot of this is happening even if you have an email. And a lot of times, it&#8217;s great to have these interactions to demystify&#8230; You have these broad statements. I don&#8217;t share my data, or I don&#8217;t put my stuff on a drive. And I just ask people simple questions. &#8220;Do you have a driver&#8217;s license? Do you have a credit card? Do you have an email?&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, I have all of those. Of course.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What is your email title?&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s a Gmail.&#8221; &#8220;Interesting.&#8221; And when I was at AT&#038;T, we had some pretty top secret products where you can essentially see what your marketers are pushing your segments, how to respond to that. What campaigns would be basically pushed out, if it triggered any type of red flags. So basically what you&#8217;re seeing and what you&#8217;re being pushed, you&#8217;re not controlling that in the backend.</p>
<p>And it even got to a point where you could see the types of emails that were coming into a particular customer&#8217;s account. And you think, &#8220;Yeah my email, it&#8217;s my safe space. It&#8217;s my haven. Nobody has access to it.&#8221; That&#8217;s not true. And if you work for any large company, you pretty much have to sign over any T&#038;C. And I mean, who reads terms and conditions anymore?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not happening. You want to use the latest, cool, amazing flagship phone? Guess what? You&#8217;re going to have to go through all that terms and conditions to basically sign over everything that you do on this computer, to me, the company.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s something where you say it in retrospect, either you&#8217;re okay with it or not. Sometimes you have visibility. Most societal trends, a lot of people don&#8217;t really know the extent of how things move in the back end. Which is expected, and it&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>But I think that&#8217;s why you start to see a lot of this narrative shift around, how do we build trust? How do we build transparency? Well, you&#8217;ve hid everything that you do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, you&#8217;re right. Even going to what you said about these unusual licensing agreements, you can easily just scroll to the bottom and click a checkbox. You don&#8217;t have to read all of that. I mean, it&#8217;s a design decision to put it in a place, or gate it in such a way where it&#8217;s going to be an impedance to the flow of how you move through the service. So people are just like, &#8220;Let me just get to the thing.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yeah. If I click a next button and it has me [inaudible 00:19:49] or scroll through six pages of legal, yeah, I&#8217;ll click that. You just saved me what? Five, 15 minutes of reading all that? I don&#8217;t want to read that. I just want to use my new shiny device.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. So let&#8217;s learn more about Ube. Let&#8217;s learn more about you, the person. We&#8217;ll get more into your work later. You&#8217;re originally from Hawaii, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yes. Yeah, this is correct.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me what it was growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a lot of different emotions with growing up on an island. And although it&#8217;s part of the colonized US states, it still embraces a lot of island culture. People that are Guamanian, or Samoan, Tongan. Even islanders that are from Portugal, even. Japan, you have right around the corner as well. And then all the Pacific Islands. Filipinos also came and kind of congregated that at this island.</p>
<p>So you have a lot of mixed cultures. You speak a lot of different languages. And people, or at least my family, we really embraced the cultures that we occupied. Mine in particular focused more on the Japanese-Filipino makeup. For all the people that don&#8217;t know, I am Black, Japanese, Native American, Cherokee, and Filipino. So there&#8217;s a lot going on in the background. And a lot that is a juxtaposition of welcome identity, and trying to reconfigure and how that aligns with my political visual self, especially on the mainland market.</p>
<p>But when you&#8217;re in pretty much the melting pot and brown bag of the islands, it feels like there&#8217;s no worries. And you have this expectation kind of like where anybody has grown up, that it&#8217;s like that everywhere else. You really embrace the culture, the food. You love the people around you. You love to congregate. You have parties all the time. You have the karaoke jams in the background and what have you.</p>
<p>And a lot of the culture is embraced in the kitchen. That&#8217;s how you brought these valued connections. It wasn&#8217;t about classification, or how much money you brought to the family, or how much you made, or what you did as a job. It was just more bringing your sense of self and coming to a gathering.</p>
<p>And these parties were mostly in people&#8217;s backyards and garages. There&#8217;s nothing fancy about it. And it was pretty much true to the heart of having the laulau or a pig cooked in the backyard, or a goat, or what have you. You had your older grandmothers, aunts, uncles cooking in the kitchen. You had some oysters in the corner. You had the kids playing and what have you. A lot of this sentiment and feeling is essentially what I try to go back to and showcase within different parts of my professional experience, personal experience, and all the different social channels that I occupy. And this adds and is a huge anchor to bringing that consistency within authentic experiences, is how do I capture what I went through as a kid in the islands into the new environments that I occupy? And it&#8217;s very difficult. But at the same time, there&#8217;s people that are welcoming, that are up for buying into this overall lay of the land.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now growing up there, were you really getting into design, or art, or anything? Were you a really creative kid or a creative teenager?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yes. Yeah. I was a very creative kid. I was one of those kids that were very particular, had OCD. But I was the only person that had that in my family. So I grew up in an environment where a lot of my family members, they were like hoarders. They were pack rats. A lot of stuff around them. So maybe it was rejection of having all this stuff around and trying to figure out, how do I create a controlled space within the perspective of a four or five year old, or even into a teenager?</p>
<p>I played with Legos a lot. I would build based on the instructions, and then dismantle it, create a new invention. I did basically pixelation of the Ninja Turtles, which was amazing at the time. I would build planes, motorized sets, marble creations, and what have you.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&#8217;s that part. And then I had my artistic side. Bob Ross, it was pretty big time. So I got into oil painting, and that&#8217;s where I started to really work with a new medium, and what have you.</p>
<p>And then I always drew my own Marvel cards. X-Men cards were very popular along with any other type of sports cards. So I wanted to try to make my own set and what have you.</p>
<p>So a lot of what I did was self-taught. And nobody even knew what being a creative, or a designer, or a practitioner in the artistic space. Feels was very foreign to my family. And essentially, let&#8217;s be clear. Nobody thought you could have a profession out of that. And the overall perception was, &#8220;Hey, are you painting pictures? Are you sketching? Okay, I guess that&#8217;s okay, but what else are you doing? Are you an engineer? Are you a doctor? Are you a lawyer?&#8221; It was just something that everybody gravitated to within my family, because it was all that we knew. And nobody was really going down to those verticals.</p>
<p>I grew up not in the best place of Hawaii islands. It&#8217;s not the glitz and glamour of what people visit. It&#8217;s in a pretty rough area of [inaudible 00:26:21]. And rough in the context of looking back. Growing up, that was just the state of mind. That was just who I was. But that&#8217;s why as an adult, pulling in whatever revenue, having the visibility, having this working knowledge. It&#8217;s great to have something that wasn&#8217;t in particular accessible to our family. It&#8217;s a lot of colorism. It&#8217;s dealing with being landlocked. And also just coming back to the island. If you went to the mainland, basically US to go to school, have a job, you always came back to support the family. You would never leave and keep going off to different, greener pastures. It was just an unwritten rule, unfortunately.</p>
<p>So it got to a point where hey, how do we build and use these new kind of outliers? New to me, predefined for many people that already had this structure and safety nets in place. Going to school, going to college, knowing what you&#8217;re going to major in, knowing what your interest is in high school. Doing AP classes. That&#8217;s more the academia side.</p>
<p>Then you have this cultural shift of okay, there&#8217;s a language barrier. Because I grew up speaking, mostly it was a mixture of Japanese, Hawaiian, and Filipino, and sprinkle of English. In a Pidgin way, that&#8217;s basically a slang. So not the correct way to speak English, I quickly realized. But having that interaction with somebody in the mainland and then coming from the islands, it just makes you self-conscious. Because you&#8217;re the only one speaking with an accent. You&#8217;re the only one that embraces different traits of your culture. And essentially, you&#8217;re trying to integrate yourself into something that you&#8217;re always built up to look forward to, which was American quintessential culture. Things that you see on TV. The white picket fences, and the large property, and the house. And that was something that you kind of strive towards, and that was ingrained in you.</p>
<p>In the mainland, you have the paper bag test to determine your worth based on how fair-skinned you were. And this was very prevalent even in the islands. Even in a melting pot. Still you have this if you&#8217;re a lighter skin, you can tell that you&#8217;re a tourist, a Haole. You have to darken up. Which is not like the status quo, but you have contradictory thoughts in your family because they&#8217;re trying to enforce, &#8220;Hey, you need to be lighter to enable you to navigate within the mainland space of America.&#8221; So stay out of the sun, be lighter, stifle your accent, try to speak more quote unquote &#8220;American.&#8221; Have that vernacular, that slang. And you&#8217;re kind of brought to embrace your culture. But at the same time, try to adopt another one and strive towards that, while concealing your own identity.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s something that even till this day, I tend to struggle with. Even though we&#8217;ve shared a stage many times, Maurice, where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, how do we bring our authentic selves? What does that mean? Is it even true? Is it prevalent?&#8221;</p>
<p>The long and short of it is no. If I brought my authentic self to work, the foundation island boy. A, there would be a language barrier. B, it would just be too welcoming, too hyper empathetic. Giving your sense of self in order to embrace these new connections. Nobody really does that in corporate identity, let alone in a professional landscape. So we can unpack that a lot more, but I&#8217;ll pause there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, you already unpacked a lot. Part of that, I do want to revisit I think a little bit later. But I&#8217;m curious. It sounds like all of this might have been the impetus for you to leave Hawaii and go to San Francisco. You studied design there at a few colleges in San Francisco. Walk me through that time. I mean, you were at Berkeley. You were at CCA. Walk me through that time.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yeah. I would say in sophomore year of high school, that&#8217;s where I was pretty much going through a huge transition culturally, self-identity. Also, just seeing how things, and structures, and academia worked in the mainland. And it was very different from what I was used to, and it was a very hard experience.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I found out that I was incredibly bright. So I would go through all the different classes. I wasn&#8217;t really challenged. And this is why I started to leverage City College. So you can do all AP classes. But if you do that, what is next? You have to start doing undergraduate classes. And then I figured out in high school, &#8220;Hey, the more classes you take for a college credit, you can apply that to whatever school you go to for your undergrad. That&#8217;s very lucrative. That sounds about right.&#8221;</p>
<p>And take note. Nobody&#8217;s funneling my rent, my groceries, let alone my higher education and extracurricular activities. Which was sports and playing a little football. I did bowling, pool. I tried to get into a lot of different areas, while at the same time trying to find myself and see where I fit within the new landscape of these cliques that form in high school.</p>
<p>And I quickly realized, at least looking back, that being hyper empathetic&#8230; I wasn&#8217;t hyper empathetic, but I really cared about the wellbeing of others. I didn&#8217;t agree with bullying. I tried to make everybody feel welcome. But at the same time, tried to be very personal to different demographics. I never saw myself as just one thing. It was something that I always I wouldn&#8217;t say rejected, but I could never pigeonhole myself to be one thing, because I embrace so many different things in cultures. I could never call myself, &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m American.&#8221; I could never pick one particular identity that I embrace, or even my makeup of myself. It&#8217;s something that going through the evolvement and starting to learn who I was, I think I embraced different channels of that, to really play into the gray area and see what the benefits are for, hey, if I&#8217;m signing on for a job interview at a retail store? Was it better to put my Filipino background, or Japanese, or mix? Or could I play my Black card?</p>
<p>These were things that I was starting to find out, and just trying to demystify what it meant to be these different backgrounds, and whether it was cool to be quote unquote &#8220;mixed.&#8221; There was a period where it was. But even if you were, you still identified with one particular identity. And that was your dominant one. And typically if you&#8217;re mixed with African American or Black, you identify with that. It&#8217;s better. You can segue into groups more. You have more of a support structure. But if you identify that kind of ambiguity, it just goes off into the abyss. You have to figure that on your own. Google search is not going to help you out.</p>
<p>Back to the academia, I first got into computer programming surprisingly, and did C+, Unix, Linux, Java, CSS, HTML, HTML 3.0. And that&#8217;s where I thought my digital calling was. And let&#8217;s be clear. I&#8217;m trying to figure this out. I don&#8217;t have mentors. I don&#8217;t even know what a mentor is. Nobody in my family knows, &#8220;Hey, this is digital arts.&#8221; So I&#8217;m kind of finding this out, and finding out that I really don&#8217;t want to be an engineer. I don&#8217;t want to write code.</p>
<p>And when I was at Berkeley, I found out through an instructor. And he turned me on to web development. And this is when I also met, I would consider them my mentors today. Ricardo Gomes and Steve Jones. And they really shaped and they provided that color of, &#8220;Hey, this is industrial design.&#8221; I can&#8217;t remember if it was specifically&#8230; I think it was Ricardo Gomes, but he wanted me to enter, what is this? A sneaker design competition. And I was like, &#8220;What is this? What do you mean? I don&#8217;t design sneakers. I have a pretty good portfolio that I built in up in high school. But what do you mean a competition for drawing?&#8221; It was just so foreign to me. And I&#8217;m just quiet islander boy, just trying to figure it out. I was always hesitant to speak up, because I was very self-conscious of my accent, not saying the right words, and articulating myself in a way that could reflect my thoughts. That was very hard. I knew it in different dialects. But in the English dialect, I could not think of some of the words. So that made me hesitant when I had these interactions.</p>
<p>So this is the beauty of going into art is that you could use other channels to really showcase how you think as an individual, no matter what linguistics barriers you have.</p>
<p>So I went into that competition. I was runner up, I didn&#8217;t win. But it was great to have somebody invest in you. And that&#8217;s when I also met Steve Jones as well. And he really provided that aperture mainly into graphic design and showing that, &#8220;Hey, there&#8217;s art schools out there. Here&#8217;s this thing called industrial design.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What is that? That&#8217;s kind of like an inventor, but wait. I could use a little bit of my programming background. I could work on different platforms, whether it&#8217;s digital, whether it&#8217;s an interface, human ergonomics. Whoa, this is kind of cool. I could get behind that.&#8221;</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s when I applied to CCAC, and then I got in. I pretty much didn&#8217;t make it to a lot of other art schools. But again, on this journey of trying to figure it out, trying to peel back the layers, and see what my calling was. Because honestly, going through this trip, I was lost half the time. It wasn&#8217;t like I had this predetermined track where it was like, &#8220;Yes, Ube Urban today, and customer user experience, and the digital platforms.&#8221; That&#8217;s what I was going to do as a kid. I didn&#8217;t know I wanted to become an inventor. Nobody knew what that was. Nobody even knew that it was a job in my family, let alone my network.</p>
<p>Going back into shifting into going to CCAC, that&#8217;s where I really started to flex my creative muscle, and started to really adopt this new culture. And adopting this new culture, you&#8217;ll start to uncover that it&#8217;s intersectional. It&#8217;s the fabric of who I am, because it&#8217;s the involvement. It&#8217;s how I interacted. It&#8217;s how I presented myself. It&#8217;s how I develop these methodologies. It was me starting to learn what I did and didn&#8217;t like within a culture that was very foreign to me. And trying to adopt the culture that essentially wasn&#8217;t designed for us was something that I was living and still living to this day, which is quite amazing.</p>
<p>So my aperture of the overall world started to just really open up. And I started to go into different art forms, learning about art history, all the different channels. From interior design, fashion, the creative writing arts, and what have you. My mind was blown.</p>
<p>And then I&#8217;m around eclectic amount of mindsets and diversity. From people around the world, from various economic levels. And it was just refreshing. I met a lot of great people that I never had experience meeting in my whole lifetime, until I went to college. So yeah, it was basically an eye-opener of, &#8220;Hey, there&#8217;s supportive people. There&#8217;s people that think the same way I do, but they&#8217;re from different backgrounds.&#8221; You&#8217;re getting to know me for me, and I don&#8217;t have to provide my professional sense of soul forward, or the person I want to put forward, and have that perceived value in order to gain acceptance.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like this was when I was starting to drop down my walls, lower my guard. Because I was pretty much on guard until my early twenties. And this is something that also I learned about myself, speeding up in to current day of some friction points.</p>
<p>If that one particular pain point is pressed in that way that I&#8217;ve experienced when I was a kid, boom, the guard goes up. And then I shut down. And when I look back into who I was, and tried to showcase and flourish into this more charismatic, and open person, and bringing your authentic self to the forefront, that wasn&#8217;t me. I was the introverted self for a very long time. And I still am a hybrid. I&#8217;m introverted, but I&#8217;m extroverted and I can turn it on. But I do need to recharge myself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I&#8217;ve heard in past interviews, that you&#8217;ve talked about this transition to the mainland as a culture shock. Which I think you definitely have outlined that this was a real shifting and changing of worlds. Not just because you&#8217;re breaking out from the island to the mainland. I think that&#8217;s one part of the narrative. But also expanding your own awareness of what you can do as a creative and as a designer.</p>
<p>And I think it&#8217;s also just really cool that part of that story is getting inspired by Black designers. Steve Jones that we&#8217;ve had on the show. Steve was one of my first guests back in 2013, 10 years ago. Jesus. Oh my God.</p>
<p>But I say all that to say that I think it&#8217;s really cool that through your education and even through getting inspired by these Black designers, that it helped to shape who you were at, I think this very important stage. I would say late teens, early twenties, going into college. That&#8217;s such a highly impressionable time in terms of the kind of work that you want to do, the kind of person that you want to become. I just think it&#8217;s really great how much that time has really shaped you.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yes, it has. And that timeline, we pretty much all cultivate it in so many different points of our lives. And that&#8217;s why for me personally, yes, that was a groundbreaking time. But even people that I influence and interface with today, you never know if that moment is going to be that pinnacle moment. Whether it&#8217;s their first job, or they are a senior within their field. But you never know when you&#8217;re going to have these meaningful experience that people are going to reflect on and be like, &#8220;Hey, I have this conversation with Ube. He pointed me in this direction. We kind of went back and forth, and I spun off and did my own thing.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t have to come back full circle. And this is why I really love to embrace these relationships. Whether they form into a new bond, or they pretty much spin off and go into their own trajectory. It&#8217;s just very interesting how we kind of influence the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now speaking of spinning off and going into your own trajectory, and this was a really interesting part that I learned about you coming into this. Tell me about Ube&#8217;s Icecream Shop. How did that come about? Tell me about all of that.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, sure. This was basically an answer to working into smaller consultancies and boutique agencies in San Francisco. During that time, it was you wanted to work at basically the two main spots, which was either Frog Design or IDEO. I could go down the list of other ones that were very hot during that design culture.</p>
<p>I went through a lot of different management styles. I was a pixel pusher at that time. So I was at that stage where I was just trying to get my leg in the door, get that professional experience. And also start really building these tools that I either learned at Berkeley, or at CCAC, or what have you, and bring that to the forefront.</p>
<p>Most of my interactions with management probably wasn&#8217;t the greatest. Never really saw eye to eye, or I just didn&#8217;t like other people being treated basically of where you sat in the ladder, myself included. Let&#8217;s be clear, you can pretty much feel if you&#8217;re not being respected as a person, let alone a professional. And that doesn&#8217;t feel good. You don&#8217;t go back from a long working day and be like, &#8220;Oh yes, I feel recharged.&#8221; A lot of these experiences kind of break you down and make you self-reflect. That&#8217;s what I could call it now. But during its time, was navigating to something that was better. So that was basically a rejection of how I wanted to treat people. If I had my own company, how would I want to embrace others? What would be my methodology? How would we interface with our clients? Do we want to flatten the org? Whatever that meant. That didn&#8217;t exist during its time. It was just like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m a true person. I&#8217;m a big grunge. I&#8217;m a really play into the boutique street life, and also showcase a little bit of my graffiti background.&#8221; Actually, a lot of it.</p>
<p>And Ube&#8217;s Icecream Shop pretty much comprised of omnichannel experiences or how we defined that today. It spun into doing graphic prints, to doing custom bicycles. That&#8217;s what the primary business was. And we did this for small, medium, large businesses. We did it for a lot of prolific clients as well. From Robin Williams, to Prince the artist, Mel Gibson. I mean, we&#8217;ve done so many different custom initiatives for a lot of A-listers, sports players as well.</p>
<p>But the long and short of it was if you went into our environment, our studio, it was there to just pretty much what you&#8217;re doing now, Maurice, is breaking down the walls. Be your authentic self, be who you want to be. Check your ego, check yourself, check your personified value at the door. Here, we&#8217;re going to have a different way of building our packages or ice cream. So when people came back returning customers, they would have this kind of lingo, this dialect that pulled us together, &#8220;Hey, I want to come to have a single scoop of your service.&#8221; That meant just pretty much the basic package. Or, &#8220;Hey Ube, I want the full experience. I want the banana split with the sprinkles on top.&#8221; &#8220;Okay, cool. I&#8217;m going to have to allocate more of my team to your initiative. This is really big. This is a high valued target for any particular client.&#8221;</p>
<p>But you started to have this overall internal culture and feeling of, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re creating something new.&#8221; But it&#8217;s so modular where I didn&#8217;t want to have control. But as the business started to flourish, as the visibility started to become a little bit more known, also tapping into a global market, you have to start growing up. And it&#8217;s kind of counterintuitive of the graffiti world.<br>
You do this amazing art. You don&#8217;t know how long it&#8217;s going to be on the walls, on bus, on whatever surface that you choose. You&#8217;re competing with either your friends, some competing artists, to really get your name out there, to put your art out there on a street level. But you never put your actual name to it.</p>
<p>It was always your graffiti name. It&#8217;s this personified value. &#8220;Yeah, if you knew me, you knew the art. You knew my name.&#8221; And vice versa for all my friends out there.</p>
<p>But when you start to have more of that public lens, I had to start making these decisions of should I represent the brand, the business, and sell it with my face on it? Or should I sell it for the brand of the name? I went down the route of really popularizing the brand through the name, through the face. And there&#8217;s positives and negatives about it that we can go into later. But that&#8217;s pretty much the beginnings and involvement of the ice cream shop.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I mean let&#8217;s get into it now. I mean, it sounds like you were really making a name for yourself as a creative in San Francisco. You&#8217;re an artist, you&#8217;re a painter. Look, I saw the videos of you on the track bikes zooming through San Francisco, which surprised me because I was like, &#8220;This is not a movie that I made before.&#8221; On a track bike, got chopsticks in here. I was like, &#8220;Who is this? This is not who I knew.&#8221; Talk more about that.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Basically, I was just doing whatever I wanted brand wise. I didn&#8217;t care about what my identity was on the forefront. I pretty much was a trendsetter within my own world. And being in San Francisco, everybody embraces that. You could be whoever you want to be. You could be whatever niche culture. Guess what? You&#8217;re going to have your group there. And if you want to cross pollinate your group and try to find somebody that&#8217;s completely opposite to you, that is readily available as well.</p>
<p>So you had this mixing pot of a lot of what I embraced and what I could relate to growing up. But it was just really pushing the behavior of my social interactions, and starting to really embrace and be proud of who I am and who I was meant to be at that given time, and forward.</p>
<p>I could call myself a entrepreneur or a creator. But it came down to, that&#8217;s where I started to take people under my wing. That&#8217;s when I started to glorify personalized mentorships, doing internship programs and what have you. Worked with schools in the Bay Area and whatnot.</p>
<p>I learned a lot of different elements of what I embrace today, which is something I would never look back and have that reasoning that, &#8220;Hey, I could be an evangelist in the space. People could actually look towards my guidance for doing better or exploring other areas.&#8221; That just wasn&#8217;t top of mind. It was more about, how can we run a successful business? How do we keep it grunge and small? And how do we keep it a boutique agency in the city? We&#8217;re trying to embrace and reflect the culture of San Francisco. We are proud of that. But also, I was proud of my heritage. So I had the long hair. I had my man bun. Yeah, I had a lot of chopsticks that match with all the different outfits and whatnot. I wore a lot of purple, a lot of lavender, because Ube is a purple yam, and my family is infatuated with purple. So if you see that in a branding or anything going forward, it goes down to basically the crux of what I&#8217;m based off of is this purple identity.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where I started to also flourish my management styles and start to explore what areas of expertise that we wanted to define ourselves by. And long and short of it, I just wanted to not want a pigeonhole.</p>
<p>So you&#8217;ll start to see this over and over again. You&#8217;ll start to see the pattern of me not wanting to be defined as one particular thing. And this is both in my personal landscape and professional world. I don&#8217;t want to be known as one, two, three. Or, &#8220;Hey, he&#8217;s this. Hey, he&#8217;s that.&#8221; I know we have to have these nomenclatures in order to define who we are within different spaces. But I essentially just wanted to put the brand of the people first. Myself first, my team, and really embrace that.</p>
<p>And this was before we would showcase to everybody in our narratives or in our proposals, &#8220;Hey, this is the team. Here&#8217;s all the stories. Here are all the people you&#8217;re working with.&#8221; We&#8217;re doing that. And we didn&#8217;t know if it was popular or not. We just thought, &#8220;Hey, it would be great to just really showcase cool individuals.&#8221; We have different working styles. We are essentially doing our own things. This is my own thing, but it&#8217;s becoming popular. And my friends would pretty much go towards, &#8220;Hey, Ube&#8217;s doing something big. I want to get on that.&#8221; And I would have friends that would be videographers, or other graphic designers, or even photographers.</p>
<p>And this also helped put that brand out there. And then you had the Japanese market and people from around the world really chomp out the bit with what&#8217;s going on in San Francisco. Because you&#8217;re doing something anywhere trend setting in the bay, the bay proper. If you&#8217;re doing it in that seven grid of San Francisco, you&#8217;re doing something well, whether you know it at that given time or you self-reflect.</p>
<p>At the time, I didn&#8217;t know I was doing something that big. I mean yes, the A-listers came in. But when you&#8217;re doing a one-off client project, they don&#8217;t really have that sustainability as opposed to doing a large contract with a corporate gig or something.</p>
<p>But the long and short of it is we&#8217;re just essentially doing what we loved. We&#8217;re riding track bikes everywhere. Track bikes, FYI, do not have brakes. So basically, you&#8217;re carving a snowboard using your back tire to slow down, going down the hills of San Francisco. Or climbing them. Let&#8217;s just say my legs were double the size they are today. And they&#8217;re fueled by tacos, and burritos, and horchata. That&#8217;s all we ate all the time.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful grunge time before a lot of the gentrification happened within the rest of the parts of the neighborhood and what have you. The city that it is today was way different from the early 2000s. I would say the shift happened in about 2014. And that would be my catapult out of the Bay Area into a newer metropolitan city.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So is that what precipitated your move from San Francisco here to Atlanta?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
It is. And I also met my wife in the Bay, which was quite amazing. This added to just that overall mindset of, &#8220;Okay, what is the new pastures going to be?&#8221; And yes, being in a lucrative industry and having your name out there, it was great. But you have to hustle hard. And let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s hard to make good money, and live in the Bay Area, and have all the overhead.</p>
<p>So it just got to a point where I was at a pinnacle point of my career of, &#8220;What do I want to do next? Do I want to grow the company? Do I want to sell it? Do I want to get back into maybe leadership for another company? Do I want to try corporate identity?&#8221; Because I rejected it. And everybody around me, especially being in San Francisco, you didn&#8217;t really support larger corporations. You always try to keep things more small and intimate. And a lot of the larger firms like the IDEOs and the Frogs, they&#8217;re basically bought from larger parent companies now. And just the overall culture and what it meant as a designer, it&#8217;s just very different.</p>
<p>And then you have these new industries and titles of UX/UI, UX researchers, copywriters. And this digital existence pretty much shaping what people do as a craft. Being an artist, a designer. This is something that&#8217;s outside of that digital field. This is like using your hands. This is like using the city as your landscape. This is like tinkering to come up with these amazing ideas.</p>
<p>And I feel like there&#8217;s just a lost art and direction for that. People develop their skills, which is great in the tech world. But in order to push that to a different barrier, you have to really leverage those meaningful connections. Whether it&#8217;s through your relationships, or even you as a core artist, what that meant. How do you bring it back to that space?</p>
<p>And this is something that it&#8217;s an infinite circle. How do I re-embrace why I got into this industry? Like we talked about before, Maurice, we&#8217;re just so jaded. We know what&#8217;s happening behind a curtain. We&#8217;ve been around this space for more than 15 years. Things are changing. But a lot of the crux of it, guess what? Still the same. You can change the landscape, you can change the platform, methodologies. They still stand. The tools change. Whatever, learn a new tool. But people aren&#8217;t paying for you to be basically a pixel pusher. They&#8217;re paying for you to look beyond what is in this occupation.</p>
<p>How can you be a proven leader? How do you know about all these different aspects and verticals of the business? That&#8217;s what they want. And if they can get more titles and more hats out of you, guess what? That&#8217;s their benefit. And is it your benefit? Is that what you want to do? I don&#8217;t know. It depends. It depends on the grass is greener.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been times where I want to wear one or two hats. And there&#8217;s other times where I want to wear eight, and I&#8217;ll do it at a cost. So it all depends on where you&#8217;re at that given time within your career, life, and what have you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, there&#8217;s been a shift now I&#8217;d say probably over the past, I think 10+ years now of design moving not out of visual. I mean, I think visual of course is still a big part of it, because we all have eyes. But moving into design, and strategy, and business. How it all works together, particularly when you see the rise of SaaS companies or the product based companies. It&#8217;s not so much about, &#8220;How can I express myself as a designer, as a creative?&#8221; It&#8217;s about, how can I use my skills for the product? It feels like that&#8217;s what the push has gone into.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yeah. And I mean, let&#8217;s be clear. The compensation is ridiculous.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yes. I would love to just really explore my craft as an artist, as a model maker, as an industrial designer. But you compare that compensation to what you do within strategy, or even the tech world. Let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s a cool four times more. And it&#8217;s hard not to notice that. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;How do I get into that world?&#8221;</p>
<p>Especially if you&#8217;re, I wouldn&#8217;t say a starving artist. But let&#8217;s just say your net worth, keeping that up. You&#8217;re hustling. You&#8217;re working like a dog. And then you can sit back and work in a corporate job, write the funding, have that apply and fulfill your lifestyle. Give you accessibility of things that were unattainable. Maybe going back to my family and my basis. The numbers that I see, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;That&#8217;s unheard of.&#8221; Nobody&#8217;s making that kind of money in my family. I don&#8217;t care who you are. We don&#8217;t come from that type of background. Plus guess what? Again, it wasn&#8217;t important.</p>
<p>So kind of shifting that mindset where you bring up this as well, Maurice, which is something that I self-reflect of, &#8220;This is not really the Ube that I know.&#8221; For me personally, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh my gosh, that nicks a little bit out of my thick exterior.&#8221; But at the same time I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, this is interesting on my new platform platform on what I spun off into.&#8221; You&#8217;re seeing me more in the suits and ties in corporate identity, but that wasn&#8217;t my basis. I wasn&#8217;t like that all the time. And guess what? If I had the option, I always want to be that authentic self of what I was in the bay. Because I learned so much.</p>
<p>I learned so much about myself, interacted with people, what it meant to burn bridges, the highs and lows of having your own company, taking risks. It got pretty deep. And that&#8217;s why I never capture my journey as puppy dogs and ice cream. It was rough. And to be honest, it&#8217;s still rough till this day. That journey, I would say it&#8217;s easier, but it&#8217;s different. And the things that I have to think about as an adult and somebody that&#8217;s very seasoned in my career, it&#8217;s just a different landscape of what&#8217;s important. The visibility, things that are also currency to other people. Let&#8217;s just say everything that my makeup is based off of isn&#8217;t really currency within corporate space, which is very interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So what do you do to try and maintain your authentic self?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
It kind of jostles me a little bit. Like, &#8220;Whoa, wow.&#8221; Yeah, I have my predefined journey, but not a lot of people turn to tables that often of, &#8220;Hey Ube, I want to get to know you.&#8221; It&#8217;s more of, &#8220;I want to get to know you, but there&#8217;s some type of value, and we need some trade-offs going forward in order to cultivate this relationship.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this is where it becomes a little complicated because I&#8217;m invested in growing people. But it doesn&#8217;t have to go full circle. But the relationships beyond corporate identity, it&#8217;s always tit for tat. What are you going to do for me? You know? You got to play that bureaucratic landscape of, &#8220;Okay, you do this for me, I&#8217;ll do that. And from there we&#8217;ll grow off each other, and eventually burn bridges and shape shift, and go through all the reorgs, and what have you.&#8221; And essentially you&#8217;re just looking out for the best interests of yourself. So if you go against that, but you&#8217;re living and navigating that landscape, it&#8217;s interesting. And it&#8217;s a social experiment that will never get old.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So let&#8217;s take work out of that. And let&#8217;s take also, I think doing this for other people&#8217;s benefit. How do you try to maintain your authentic self to yourself?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
This is probably a difficult part of the navigation. Because being your authentic self, especially if I&#8217;m in an environment that is not receptive to that. But it&#8217;s definitely throttled. Yes, I&#8217;m personable. Yeah, I&#8217;m authentic. Am I my authentic self? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;ve had these conversations in the past, Maurice. When you have even an uptick of 5%, 10% of bringing your authentic self in who you are, we know what comes from that. I knew my background wasn&#8217;t the best. I knew that it wasn&#8217;t picture perfect. But there are a lot of things that I embrace and still do to this day.</p>
<p>It gets to a point where, how do I really have acceptance? How do I mitigate stereotypes when I&#8217;m interacting with people, and how do I put that forward as well? I want people to see past what you see me on the forefront. If you see the suit, you see the armor, you see whatever monetary objects that are on me. Whatever. But when it comes down to it, that&#8217;s not the person that I am upholding. It&#8217;s my armor, and I&#8217;m very particular about it. But I&#8217;m doing it just for myself and myself only. It&#8217;s not to gain acceptance. It&#8217;s not for other people to gain any type of, how do I say this? Acceptance within their environment. It&#8217;s just hey, how do I navigate my sense of self being myself? But how do I also navigate being myself and going along with the current? How do I blend in? Because I have a hard time within society to blend in. At least the physical forefront would be just how I dress, or even my hair, or even being the ambiguity of ethnicity. People are just very curious human beings. They want to know, and a lot of people cannot bite their tongue.</p>
<p>So if I&#8217;m getting a cup of coffee, they&#8217;re going to be like, &#8220;Oh wow. Hey, cool hair.&#8221; Or I&#8217;ll get some sly come in, &#8220;Hey, have you seen that cartoon character?&#8221; And this is all interactions that you honestly don&#8217;t have time for, but they just come to you? &#8220;How long does it take? How long does it take to get ready in the morning?&#8221; And these are basically party tricks. Yeah, they&#8217;re kind of cool.</p>
<p>But this is what people want to know about me. And it&#8217;s very unfortunate because I&#8217;m a lot more than my personified value. Even just, &#8220;Hey, ask me about what I want to do.&#8221; A lot of people don&#8217;t ask me what I do as a professional. You&#8217;re probably the first person in a while that&#8217;s asked me, &#8220;Hey Ube, what do you do as a professional? What do you do?&#8221; As opposed to having that talk track that I have with the clients, but I feel like a puppet sometimes when I go through that vernacular. I have my bullet points. I know what pretty much makes people&#8217;s eyebrows rise and interest. And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh cool. Awesome.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think you&#8217;ve used some very interesting language here. I don&#8217;t know, this is not turned into a therapy session. I promise. I notice this tension between who you are when you&#8217;re just you, just yourself. Nobody else is around. And the Ube Urban that is presented to the world. You mentioned your dress and your hair as armor. And even when I asked about the authentic self, I was like, &#8220;Take work out of it. Take other people out of it.&#8221; And you brought them right back in.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I noticed that kind of tension between you who are, and that you have to be in order to move forward in this hellscape capitalist society, I guess. Would you say that&#8217;s accurate?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yes, it is. It&#8217;s very accurate. And this basically aligns with my identity both professionally. And when to turn it on, when to turn it off. And there&#8217;s a lot of gray area where it&#8217;s just confusing, or a lot of times you&#8217;re just so saturated to be this person that you aren&#8217;t. But you have to play these cards so frequently when you do shapeshift, or you&#8217;re around different friends, or around different networks. You kind of go into this behavior of, &#8220;Okay, cool. Let me just use these cards real quick.&#8221; It&#8217;s productized, it&#8217;s easy, and it works.</p>
<p>And then when you use that in front of the wrong audience, you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wait, hold on. What happened?&#8221; So you start to become a little automated yourself. And I&#8217;m not going to lie, it&#8217;s happened to me and it still happens to me. I have my best friends, they have to pull me out of it. They have to check me. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Hey Ube, I really don&#8217;t care about what your last initiative was. I don&#8217;t care how much you sold that work for. I don&#8217;t care what you bought. Can you stop talking about that?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh my God, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221; And then you basically have to pull your head out of your and just be like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m trying to work on being myself.&#8221; But at the same time, like you&#8217;re saying, you have these tensions. You have these friction points where you&#8217;re playing different personified values, and then you get caught up into being that person.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m an executive leader, I can&#8217;t be the authentic self. That&#8217;s not the currency. But I could be my authentic self around my best friends because that&#8217;s it. But again, you&#8217;re constantly playing different cards. And if you played the wrong card in a different landscape or environment, you might get checked on it. And I typically do with people that are still authentic, and still themselves, and coming back as the grownup Ube, and interfacing with these folks that still embrace that. Yeah. You can definitely guarantee that there there&#8217;s a ton of tension drawing between the lines of bringing full authenticity in your makeup forward, and having that valued. But if it isn&#8217;t valued, those talking points, they just start to be placed in your back pocket. You start to not use them as often. You start to just use basic talk tracks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
May I offer some advice?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yes, absolutely. All the time. Always welcome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think if there&#8217;s any place in this country outside of perhaps San Francisco where you can lean into the various Venn diagram intersections of your identity and use that to your advantage, it&#8217;s here. I mean yes, it&#8217;s the south. I get that it&#8217;s Atlanta. It&#8217;s Georgia I should say. Georgia and Atlanta are two different things. But I feel like if there&#8217;s any place you can make that happen, it would be here outside of San Francisco. Perhaps New York too. I don&#8217;t know. And this is not to say, &#8220;Pick up and move,&#8221; or whatever.</p>
<p>But I would like to see the Ube that leans more into those spots that it sounds like make other people uncomfortable, especially as you&#8217;ve described it. And see how far that gets you. Because I think if anything, with personal branding now, so much is about identity and about the different spaces that you occupy. Whether you are queer, whether you&#8217;re disabled, different race, etc. You can lean into those and find community, and find like-minded people, and opportunities, and things of that nature.</p>
<p>Given where you&#8217;re at now, you are currently free from corporate obligation, which is a fun way of saying you don&#8217;t have a job right now. But given that you&#8217;re outside of that space now, where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing? What do you want the next chapter of your story to be?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s something that I am asking myself during this duration as well. There&#8217;s always topics of shifting into being a mentor, a coach, a leader, an advocate within the space. But that would mean going back into the best and worst practices of my own brand. Let&#8217;s just say I don&#8217;t have the best work ethic when it comes to representing myself, so I need to sometimes steer clear of that.</p>
<p>But from my understanding, I&#8217;m trying to cultivate consistencies in my life. And to be honest, it&#8217;s really hard to answer that question because work. I know it sounds like it&#8217;s priority based on my interactions. Nut on my actual list, it&#8217;s at the bottom of the list. So it&#8217;s hard for me to devote that much time and energy of what the forecasts are. If you asked me a couple moons ago, I&#8217;d be like, &#8220;This is where I want to be in three years. I want to climb this ladder, I want this visibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>But now I&#8217;ve pretty much had my appetite fulfilled in so many different areas, that question of, &#8220;What do you want to do next?&#8221; It becomes much more difficult to process. It&#8217;s almost like grass is greener. What am I revisiting that I&#8217;ve already done to fulfill that void, and how sustainable is that void?</p>
<p>I could go corporate identity, I could do agencies, I could have my own brand. But what are the trade-offs, and do they coincide where my life is now? There&#8217;s a lot of things that come into play rather than, what is the ideal job? &#8220;If you could have any job, what would be your perfect job? It&#8217;s like a behavioral question that you would get from human resources or something.</p>
<p>So coming into that, I still struggle with creating that identity and that appetite for what is to come. To be honest, I&#8217;m seeing what&#8217;s in the market. Because as you know, there&#8217;s new titles, there&#8217;s new formations. And who these new practitioners are and can be, and which ones are the same. Because I&#8217;ve had over 20 different titles, but I do the same type of work. So that&#8217;s also something that&#8217;s very interesting to me as a professional as well. But I know I didn&#8217;t answer your question, Maurice. That&#8217;s all I got as of now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was going to say if you haven&#8217;t thought of what that is because of the time that you&#8217;re at now, give it some thought. Give it some thought. Don&#8217;t think that you have to rush right into slotting into whatever the next position is that you know you could get because of the work that you&#8217;ve done. Really take some time. And sit down with yourself, do the introspection, do the work, and think about where it is you can really be your most optimal self without the armor, without the expectations of other people. Really take some time and think about that.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Onto the next, and searching under different rocks and crevices to hopefully find more talented people to inspire myself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yeah. You&#8217;re not going to find authentic information. But you can get in touch with me either through my website, which would be www.ubeurban.com, basically first and last name. I&#8217;m pretty receptive on all my social channels, but you could also reach out on LinkedIn. Just type in first and last name again, Ube Urban. And drop me a call. Drop me a message if you want to grab some time on my calendar and peel back the layers of the navigation and Ube Urban himself.</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s very difficult to provide that identity forward. Yes, I have that professional and corporate makeup. But you need to have discussions. You need to have the conversation in order to actually understand where my journey is and where it&#8217;s heading.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And hopefully when people listen to this interview, that&#8217;s what they&#8217;ll start to get.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yes. Yes. Thanks again Maurice, for your time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Ube, I just want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I sort of had an idea of where I thought this conversation might go. And certainly as I did my research and I was like, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know all this stuff about Ube,&#8221; and I&#8217;ve met him, and we&#8217;ve talked on panels and stuff. But I will be interested to see what your next move is after you&#8217;ve really like I said&#8230; And this is advising, take it or leave it. But if you take the time to really think about what you want that next move to be like Ube without the armor, etc., I&#8217;d be really interested to see where you go in the future with that.</p>
<p>Because you and I, I would say we&#8217;re probably roughly right around the same age. We&#8217;ve reached this point in our career where we&#8217;ve paid our dues. We&#8217;ve paid our dues, we know our shit. And we&#8217;re at the point where we can start to really carve our own identity and make the path forward with doing what we want to do, and not so much about what the corporate sphere might have in space. Whether that&#8217;s entrepreneurship or what have you. But I feel like the more you lean into that, lean into those uncomfortable parts. I think that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll really start to really grow and shine more. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Ube Urban:</b><br>
Yes. Yes. Thank you. Thanks, Maurice. Really appreciate it.</p>
