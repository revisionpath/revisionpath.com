Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>Gus Granger has been a staple in the Dallas design community for over 20 years. Not only that, his design work has reached international acclaim, earning honors from Adobe, AIGA, Communication Arts, and many other groups. But perhaps Gus&#8217;s biggest honor is his tireless advocacy work helping eliminate barriers for Black designers and empowering them for success in the world.</p>
<p>We caught up and talked about his recent career shift back to entrepreneurship, and he shared what he&#8217;s learned through that transition and how he brings those insights to his current work. Gus also gave some great advice for any designers looking to strike out on their own, spoke a bit about the current state of the design community from his perspective, and discussed some of the moments of joy in his career.</p>
<p>Hopefully this interview inspires you to find a way to help lift others up as you grow!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Hey, my name&#8217;s Gus Granger, I&#8217;m a designer, by that, I&#8217;m an epigraphic design roots, going brand identity messaging, positioning, web, print, really everything that a brand needs to show up and be seen and memorable in the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, we&#8217;re recording this kind of right before the year ends, so I&#8217;m curious to get a sense from you, what was 2022 for you?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yeah, 2022 was a rollercoaster ride, I think we&#8217;ve got, with all things, the personal side is, which is kind of most prominent in having three kids and career changes going on, I&#8217;ve got a daughter that just started college this fall and that was exciting, which means she graduated from high school in the spring and that was exciting. And I had the amazing experience of joining a partnership team at VSA Partners based out of Chicago, which was a dream job of mine when I worked there as a designer in the early 2000s, and I wrapped up my tenure there this summer, wanting to get closer to my design roots and being more hands on, so that was a big change in the summer and getting back to working as Gus Granger design again and just getting into the trenches with clients and designing and having these in-depth conversations and just being able to walk that journey with my clients while doing the work has been really exciting and something that I&#8217;ve missed.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is a lot. Well, congratulations definitely on your daughter going to college.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, it&#8217;s wild, the first few weeks was really difficult and my mom said, she&#8217;s like, &#8220;The first month is the hardest,&#8221; and I was like, I wonder what she&#8217;s doing now, and da da da, but she&#8217;s doing great, she comes home for the holidays pretty soon.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Is she far from Dallas where you&#8217;re at?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Oh, as far as possible, I&#8217;m in Dallas and she&#8217;s in upstate New York at Syracuse University.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yes. She&#8217;s a double major in political science and photography and I think is just tapping into her creative side as well as wanting to change the world and change the systems and make the society better and learning the building blocks of tools and how to make that happen from the inside, so that&#8217;s exciting to see her grow in that regard as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s awesome, that&#8217;s really awesome to hear. So you mentioned with VSA this kind of was a full circle moment for you in a way, you started there many years ago as a designer and then now going back and being a partner, what was that experience like for you?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Oh, it was amazing, going back to&#8230; I&#8217;m having to embrace my kind of elder statesman&#8217;s status, which is terrible, but for one, going through design school in the mid 90s VSA partners was a dream, I think the were shops at that point was in VSA and Pentagram, which really kind of helped set my kind of goals for what I wanted to do in the profession, and when I ultimately ended up working there as a senior designer, we came across some of the just most talented and really interesting projects that I&#8217;d come across in my career at that point, and it was from there that I went off into the wilderness and started my own agency and drew that for me, working by myself on an extra bedroom to a 50 person studio on the 30th floor of building down here in downtown Dallas to selling it to a client and then going in-house and leaving that.</p>
<p>It was definitely an exciting bookend, kind of not just from having worked there before, but also looking up to the work that that studio was doing in just groundbreaking, just design, in depth understanding of clients and delivering business value while just doing just stunning work, getting to go back and join the leadership team there as they kind of enter this new digital era that everyone is getting their bearings with was really a great opportunity and honor and something that I enjoyed a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now you&#8217;re working for yourself as a consultant, has it been kind of a big shift going&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, I guess maybe this is another kind of full circle thing, going back to working for yourself, has it been a bit of a shift?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Oh, for sure, I think that, as I mentioned, going from running a large agency, starting it from scratch, and I always say, every time your team doubles in size, it&#8217;s a different job, so when you go from one person to two person, you&#8217;re like, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, this is completely different from two to four, from four to eight, from eight to 16, I was doing that for about 15 years and it kind of felt like the math isn&#8217;t right here, but it kind of felt like six or seven jobs, working at six or seven different places, but during the last few chapters, so much of my time was focused on just running a business and being so distant from the work that I really, certainly wasn&#8217;t designing, there were times that I may have been wearing an executive creative director hat, but it was more just business operations and payroll and HR and cashflow management and sales and all the things that were not what I was passionate about in the first place, it&#8217;s an essential part of running a large business.</p>
<p>You just missed what you were passionate about in the first place, ultimately, that&#8217;s what led me to we transitioning the agency to in-house situation through that acquisition to our client, Cyxtera, at the time, that was a brand new gigantic global technology company, data center, cybersecurity that had been a client of ours that we&#8217;d been part of naming, building their brand identity from scratch, and that they had been growing so large as a client, just sat down with the CMO and it was like, let&#8217;s look at how this could look if we just took our team and kind of became your in-house group, and then all of us are dedicated, and ultimately, that&#8217;s what we did, and that allowed me to get back to being more hands-on and with the same group of amazing people that I had in the 70kft days, but we were kind of on the other side of the client curtain.</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s fascinating there is that there&#8217;s so many different problem solving challenges that you can confront as a designer, as an art director, as a creative director, as a product architect that would not necessarily be sent to an agency and I&#8217;d never been in-house before, and it&#8217;s just a very different and fascinating ecosystem when you&#8217;re working directly with sales teams, when you&#8217;re working directly with product teams, and the pace of work is very different, the way that you manage work is very different because there aren&#8217;t, &#8220;Budgets,&#8221; for your hours and your team&#8217;s time, and you&#8217;ve got to find different ways to manage capacity and how much time should something take, but it also opens up opportunities to, we&#8217;re designing wayfinding systems for least 60 data centers around the world, to graphics for interior sales displays, to events, to video work that just the sheer volume and depth in the brand experience was really, really, really exciting.</p>
<p>But seeing how our clients would have to socialize that and sell that work and get the information gathered, that all of those things that we missed out on that we weren&#8217;t necessarily as exposed to being on the agency side, just giving a much deeper appreciation for our clients that sometimes we can have fun kind of teasing our clients and being difficult, make the logos bigger, blah, blah, blah, we can&#8217;t get them to sign off on something, yeah, I still have my agency chip on my shoulder of that regard, but it&#8217;s much more empathy, I&#8217;d say doing the two years there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, back when we had you on the show in 2015, the firm that you&#8217;re talking about is 70kft, and I mean, I think it&#8217;s important to&#8230; a couple of things that you mentioned I think are important, first, the thing about every time you kind of double your staff, it&#8217;s a different job, that is so true, it does distance you from the work a bit, and the more that you have to be the CEO running the business, it takes so much time away from actually being hands-on with the work, sometimes you can do it, I mean, depending on the type of business that you have, you&#8217;re able to do it, but it does get a lot harder because you just have to be aware and present about so many other things that have nothing to do with the projects at all that you&#8217;re working on.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Absolutely, and I don&#8217;t say that to scare people off from starting or growing their own design firm or agencies, and there&#8217;s certainly ways that I could have grown the agency differently to keep myself closer to the work in leading it, I think at the time, there was just enough fatigue and wanting to do something different that when that opportunity came up with Cyxtera, it was like, look, here&#8217;s a way for me to continue doing the type of work that I love doing even more of it and being more hands-on, keeping my team together, and then happened to also be a client that we adored and we&#8217;d had done a lot of work with over the years when he was in different companies.</p>
<p>And so there was a lot of just trust and alignment for the business value of great design and what it looks like to advocate for that within groups in a large growing organization, and so that made that change a lot more attractive, so I say all of that, the attractiveness of that moment was like, you know what? This is more interesting than trying to go through a wholesale reset of how I have organized in bringing in different leadership to handle the types of aspects of the job that I didn&#8217;t enjoy so that I could be more hands on, it was just like, you know what? Let&#8217;s go this way because this looks like fun and something fresh and new and it was, and I&#8217;m glad we did it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Because I mean, at the end of the day, you&#8217;re running a business, so especially if you&#8217;re a designer that maybe came up through design school or if you don&#8217;t have that kind of business acumen, you&#8217;re either sort of learning it on the job as the company grows or you have to find some way to, like you said, supplement that with bringing on folks that do know the business end so you can build and scale things out hopefully in a healthy way, and I think certainly you grew 70kft, like you said, the 50 people, I mean, that&#8217;s a testament to not just the work that you&#8217;ve put in on the brand, but also the people and the team that you built around it.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Oh, a hundred percent. I forget who said this first, it actually may have been one of my first bosses through VSA, I think it was Dana Arnette, it talked about so much of growing a great team, it&#8217;s about curating talent, and that my philosophy through this was just trying to find and attract the best and most talented people possible, and then just finding opportunities for them to do their thing and get folks to work well together, and that was the most fun part of that, in creating an environment where they can find just joy in working with each other and pushing each other and finding new and inventive ways to sell our clients&#8217; story, and we had a whole mix of things that we were very much leaned into business to business technology, but we are also working with a lot of startups and some retail work.</p>
<p>And we also reserved a percentage of our time for non-profit work, which ended up being a lot of work for the Dallas Holocaust Museum, which kind of helped us satisfy this more mission-centric priority for the agency, it was from the leadership standpoint on my side and wanting to make sure that we&#8217;re putting our skills to use to benefit society, and that&#8217;s something I still try to do with my own time, but that it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s so much that we are creating that&#8217;s just fleeting, make a website and it might be live for a year or less, the client gets acquired and the identity that you just love just gets wiped away, and then what&#8217;s left? What impact did you make on the world? You helped someone sell a business and that&#8217;s great, you put three more dollars in their pocket.</p>
<p>But I think what we have unique superpowers in capturing people&#8217;s imagination and attention and persuasion through our gifts as artists, as creators, as communicators, and too often those skills are not put to work for the most important communication challenges that are holding the world back today, whether it&#8217;s just racism, just bias in general, climate change, we can just go right on down the list, and that for us to isolate our gifts for corporate interests is a tragedy, and notably, but we&#8217;ve got to eat, we got kids to put through college sometimes, there&#8217;s a whole number of things, and finding the right balance of that is key, but yeah, that&#8217;s part of my soapbox.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I mean, I feel like that&#8217;s been a growing awareness of the industry over the, I don&#8217;t know, I want to say at least over the past three years, but I would even go back as far as maybe &#8217;15, 2016, you&#8217;ve started to see this sort of unfold in different ways, I would say definitely in the 2016 to 2018, 2019, it was more about, I think, civic design and making sure that people were using their skills towards maybe improving government services and understanding the election process and voting and all that sort of stuff, and then certainly with 2020 and a lot of the protests that happened around the murder of George Floyd, then you started to see a more active presence around social justice issues, and I think it&#8217;s definitely going to increase as more, I hate to say, just as more bad shit happens in the world.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s kind of the reality of it, is like as more things happen, we, as designers, are tasked to come up with more solutions that are not just product focused, in a way, it almost feels, almost, I&#8217;ll say, it almost feels a little dismissive to just focus on product as a designer almost, I mean, I think there&#8217;s utility in it, certainly even as you mentioned with doing stuff with Cyxtera, doing things around cybersecurity and things that&#8217;s important, that feeds into product. But I think of the designers of 2011 versus the designers of now, and how the focus back then was so much on product and UX and interfaces and all that sort of stuff, and now it&#8217;s about how do we use our skills to solve the problems that are facing our society and our planet?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s definitely a different mindset today, and I think I totally agree that sadly, something has to really go wrong to get people to wake up or enough people to wake up because even you mentioned things like government services and election design, I got involved with that going back in 2000, there&#8217;s an organization, I was part of AIGA Design for Democracy that came out of the problems around ballot design in Florida in the election between Al Gore and George Bush, that&#8217;s an effort which continues today around how to make sure election systems are better designed to protect the integrity of the vote, and there were many people that were rallying to the cause back then, but there&#8217;s the problems that we can be attacking with our skills are ever present, yeah, it&#8217;s a matter of we could also wear ourselves out trying to do everything, so you have to, I think, in my mind like, all right, pick your space, I&#8217;m like, where can I be the most effective and make a biggest impact?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What is a typical day look like for you now? What does the Gus Granger workday look like?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Gus Granger workday, you know what? I think these days I&#8217;m so much more guarded with for my health, my mental health, and that I talk about joy and wanting to be in a good space, and I&#8217;m like, even though I&#8217;m working from home, I&#8217;m like, I start each day&#8230; I&#8217;ll go to one of my favorite breakfast spots and it&#8217;s my commute and I have carefully curated and found the best chocolate croissant places in the Dallas metroplex area, I will rotate through those locations and I need to start a chocolate croissant blog, but that&#8217;s a whole other podcast, but I say all that, that that&#8217;s my happy spot, and I just know that I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m listening to comedy podcast, I&#8217;m not going to wake up in the morning and to start listening to the grim news of the day because I need to start the day in a positive space.</p>
<p>But from there and I get back and start work back in my pandemic inspired office, which didn&#8217;t exist back in early 2020, but now I&#8217;m so much more comfortable and cozy there, but I&#8217;m working with having a number of different conversations around projects that&#8217;ll come to fruition months from now, working with clients that I&#8217;m in the middle of right now, and it&#8217;s a mix, some of these things are in a design phase and we&#8217;re going through looking at identity explorations or design system explorations, others are in a brand strategy phase, and we might be doing interviews with subject matter experts and other internal contacts to really start figuring out the right ways to differentiate the brand and looking at how to start the conversation in the right place and to elevate the right values and principles that are going to help define that brand at its best because we try to do that before we even start designing anything, before we start writing anything.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ll go through that brand strategy and messaging phase with amazing copywriters that I&#8217;ve been working with for years and we lay that foundation, and so I&#8217;m in different stages of that work. And I&#8217;m about to start a web project next week but what&#8217;s great is that there&#8217;s just enough of it that it&#8217;s not a 9:00 to 5:00 type thing, I can go and have a leisurely breakfast and go and walk four miles and come back and I can start my day at 10:00 and if I feel tired, I can take a nap and wake back up and do some of those things and the next day it&#8217;ll be completely different, that&#8217;s the great part of being the home-based consultant, at least at this moment, talk to me a month from now and you might get a more frazzled version of me, but hopefully I&#8217;m able to keep that at bay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s always, I think, an ebb and a flow with entrepreneurship, some days are going to be better than others, some months, some years, it just sort of ends up happening that way, but it sounds like you found a deliberate way to put joy just into your everyday work life in general.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yeah. And it&#8217;s a lesson that I&#8217;ve taken I think from the more intense days of my myself in the kft experience where they were&#8230; I think from my standpoint, I&#8217;m like, I could go through just joyless months and just trying to hold teams together and dealing with all kinds of just different operational headaches, HR headaches, team conflicts, and when you&#8217;ve got dozens of people working for you, not everybody gets along, and there are times when that the job becomes camp counselor and couples therapists, and it&#8217;s not just for its own sake or it&#8217;s like, look, I&#8217;ve got to get these folks to work together so that we can get this project completed so we can build it on Monday, that&#8217;s an intense part of the experience, and that&#8217;s definitely not something they teach you or even allude to in design school and in talking a bit earlier it was like there&#8217;s so much that gets into&#8230; they&#8217;re designers that are ready to start working for themselves as soon as they know how to design, whether they&#8217;re coming out of a four year program or if they&#8217;re self-taught.</p>
<p>And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Now, I&#8217;m going to start working for myself,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, I am so regularly trying to steer them clear from that, and be like, &#8220;Please don&#8217;t, for your own sanity,&#8221; but there&#8217;s so much that needs to be learned at that point from other people, and go and find a creative director, art director, somebody that&#8217;s going to take you under their wing, whether you can work for them directly or they&#8217;re going to mentor you, that you are going to just make a ton of mistakes, find ways to solve problems that you never even thought of, that you got to kind of go through that for years to really learn how to design at your best, and then once you figure that out, you start working for yourself, it may start being familiar when it&#8217;s just you or when you start collaborating, but it will start growing to a point where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, this is why people go to business school.&#8221;</p>
<p>And you start realizing, all right, do I start reading more business books and all these other things or start hiring for skills that I may not have? Because when you&#8217;ve got a dozen people and you&#8217;re dealing with at least negotiation, and that&#8217;s a different animal these days, because I mean, with remote and hybrid work, it&#8217;s a very different atmosphere than when I was growing my agency, but I think those days I&#8217;m like, you kind of had to have an office in order for a client to take you seriously, and that that&#8217;s like, all right, we&#8217;re looking at commercial real estate, downtown Dallas, seven year lease, but how do I grow? How do I contract? Is that even possible? And looking at business insurance and all kinds of&#8230; it&#8217;s again, stuff that you wouldn&#8217;t even get into at design school, but you may find great relationships from other designers, which I did, that had run studios, to be able to pick their brain and to figure out what things that they did and who did they seek out for consulting.</p>
<p>And you start finding consultants that just specialize in working with design firm principles or marketing firm principles, and that&#8217;s such an important resource that I feel like just gets overlooked a lot, whether we look at our design conferences and our design groups, we&#8217;re talking about how we can be better problem solvers, be better designers, better collaborators, and that&#8217;s all essential and that&#8217;s central to what it is that we do, I think we&#8217;re kind of a naturally entrepreneurial group of folks and want to create our own thing, we enjoy the independence or the autonomy, but the other aspect of it is there&#8217;s a lot that you need to learn that we don&#8217;t talk about enough in design circles that I&#8217;d love to see change in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m laughing only because as you mentioned that I&#8217;m thinking how back when I had my studio, particularly I think in the first four or five years about trying to have an address was so important and to let people know, oh yes, we are a real business, and I remember, I think I got some little tiny office space because I&#8217;m in Atlanta, it was important for me to have an address that was like, &#8220;Peach Tree Street,&#8221; so people know, oh, he&#8217;s official, and I had some little tiny office, I think I got it through Regis probably, the real estate company, got it through Regis, some little tiny office in Midtown that I never went to, but I just wanted to have the address so people knew like, oh, this is official, in the grand scheme of things, did it make a difference? Absolutely not, but in a way sort of like you mentioned, it would&#8217;ve been good to have had some knowledge to know maybe I don&#8217;t have to have this, maybe I don&#8217;t have to waste money trying to do this to prove it to customers I&#8217;m never going to get.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Well, I don&#8217;t know, man, I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;s kind of tough to prove a negative because you think of-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s true-</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
How many folks reached out to you because you had an address during those days where it&#8217;s like, oh, this isn&#8217;t in a PO box or somewhere in the suburbs, but just by seeing that you were there on a Peach Street, no one&#8217;s going to call you and be like, &#8220;I saw that you had an address, let&#8217;s talk about the [inaudible 00:28:58].&#8221; I think it&#8217;s definitely one of those things where I&#8217;m like, I think when I had moved from&#8230; I&#8217;d been working in South Bend, Indiana for some time, my wife was running marketing and PR for Whirlpool Corporation, which was based near there, we were about to have our third kid and we wanted to move closer to friends and family, and we came back to Dallas and the agency was growing at that point and I was like, I&#8217;m going to go ahead and get a space in, I think at that point it was like West End in Dallas, it&#8217;s a historic district, pretty creative space, and I just knew that the clients that I was wanting to work with were going to want to come to an office and see me and see the space.</p>
<p>And frankly, and I think at that point where I was also just thinking about just as a black designer period, that I&#8217;m like, if I&#8217;m constantly trying to meet clients in a Starbucks when I&#8217;m trying to get them to pay me a hundred grand for a website that what we&#8217;re talking about in the 2010s, I think that was a tougher ask at least in the circles that I was moving in then to get where when they could come and be in our conference room and I can bring my director of development to the table, to bring the account manager, to bring the designer and the copywriters and we can put stuff up on the screen.</p>
<p>All of that can happen through Zoom today, but as far as that confidence building, just having an address is one step, I think there&#8217;s absolutely types of work that you need to at that point, I&#8217;m not sure kind of what the equivalent would be if those barriers were just erased, but you just needed to have a space for the types of clients that we were working with, just that they could see and come and realize this is the real shop.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think certainly in the earlier days, I started my business in 2008, some clients or potential clients, they really sort of frowned on, oh, you&#8217;re just doing this from home now everyone works from home, but certainly back then, I felt there was a much stronger bias, especially to try to get larger clients and larger budgets, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not giving you this money if you&#8217;re doing this at home,&#8221; they want, it&#8217;s almost like a social proof of business in some kind of way.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yeah, no, totally.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, you&#8217;ve been a design leader and a business leader for over 20 years now, and you&#8217;ve already kind of shared some thoughts about what you&#8217;d like to see from designers, but what are your thoughts on just the design community today? How do you see things?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny, as I keep looking at, whether it&#8217;s LinkedIn and different discussions that are going on at conferences and events, it&#8217;s like what we mean by design today is different than what we meant by design 10 years ago or even 20 years ago, and that I&#8217;ve come to realize, I&#8217;m like, all right, I&#8217;m kind of a brand and marketing designer where in a way that I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily have carried that label, because even then I&#8217;m like, I will rewind back, I&#8217;m a graphic designer at my core, and I think I even mentioned that early on, and people are like, &#8220;Oh well that&#8217;s an old sounding term,&#8221; but we always have these labels, whether commercial artists, graphic artists, graphic designer, web designer, but in starting at the foundation of graphic designers, the way I was educated and being hyper passionate about conceptual thinking, typography, composition, understanding audience, adventure, discovery, being inventive and creating surprising and effective work, that in my experience design was kind of medium agnostic.</p>
<p>And so I&#8217;ve always had an allergy of, are you a graphic designer or are you a web designer? I&#8217;m like, stop, it&#8217;s all graphic design in my worldview, and I understand there are people that look at them very differently, but I feel like if you&#8217;ve got a masterful command of typography and you can understand a medium, that the world of creating a elegant website can be very similar process to creating an amazing book, but you need to understand what you&#8217;re working with, you need to understand your materials, you need to understand the people who need to collaborate in order to make that happen, not to say that web development&#8217;s the same as working with the printing press, but there are certain rules that you need to know how a book is going to function, what type of experience someone expects when they pick up a hardcover book versus a paperback book to be able to navigate that content elegantly.</p>
<p>And I think if those same muscles are put to place, the digital experience is the same, so I think things have become even more fragmented today, and that there&#8217;s&#8230; because we will say design and what will mean is UX design, which may not involve visual design at all, or just UI design using a component library, which is not the same thing as kind of the more commercial artist view of creating something from scratch that may be a step earlier in the process to be like, who is the person that&#8217;s actually creating that component library and deciding how that brand is going to show up in the product experience, and what is its relationship with the overall brand as a whole? Is there relationship between how the brand shows up in marketing and how it shows up in product?</p>
<p>But those that are kind of working with a preset component library that may be less involved with aesthetic decisions and more about flow and kind of using existing building blocks to create compelling experiences, it&#8217;s a different process entirely than staring at a blank page in the screen and be like, here&#8217;s brand X and here&#8217;s what they&#8217;re trying to solve for in the world, what should it look like? I&#8217;ve come through my view of design, my background of design, the version of design which gets me excited is the blank page, or perhaps it&#8217;s the existing page which is messed up and the client that comes in is like, &#8220;Help me make sense of this or make it better.&#8221;<br>
But there&#8217;s a lot of design work that&#8217;s out there that I hesitate to say it because it almost seems like it would be controversial, it seems to be less creative, which I don&#8217;t understand as much, but which is not to say that it&#8217;s not a matter of problem-solving because I would have debates with one of my creative directors about design as art or not, and we can go back and forth until we&#8217;re blue in the face like, what do we mean by arts? And I&#8217;m like, look, we&#8217;re in a profession and our roots as commercial artists, and that the whole notion of us creating experiences that people want to engage with, that they feel connected with in a way which is an emotional type of experience, whether it&#8217;s bringing them joy or they&#8217;re attracted to it or it&#8217;s bringing them calm peace.</p>
<p>The skills that we bring to the table there are the same innate gifts, in my view and experience, that are at the core of an artist, and whenever I would review portfolios, I&#8217;m like, what can I see in this person&#8217;s aesthetic gifts? I&#8217;m like, how innate are they able to create compelling compositions? And it&#8217;s not just to be like, all right, I&#8217;m just going to go ahead and decide that this app needs to look like a Salvador Dolly thing because this is what inspires me today. But one of my favorite architects today is Zaha Hadid and just Google her work, it&#8217;s insane, these buildings are beautiful and arresting and shocking and very functional, but there&#8217;s a very different thing, you can&#8217;t tell me that there&#8217;s not artistry, or at least the way that I&#8217;m defining art and the way that team or that architect, she&#8217;s no longer with us, viewed designing spaces for her clients.</p>
<p>You can say the same thing to be like, all right, if she&#8217;s going to create a post office as opposed to someone&#8217;s like, &#8220;Look post office, look like a gray box, we&#8217;re going to put some tracked out Futura on the side, it&#8217;s going to be one story, it&#8217;s going to do this and it&#8217;s going to do the job,&#8221; those buildings are going to look completely different, but the cultural impact, the emotional experience of people going into Zaha Hadid post office is night and day to the gray box, and it&#8217;s like that&#8217;s the view of design that I hunger for, I don&#8217;t see as present in the digital space today. I think accessibility and user experience is definitely benefiting it from a bunch of artists anarchists going out there just creating a bunch of chaos, which was exemplified in the flash era, but there was a lot more beauty and discovery, I think, happening in the digital space that was there again, but it&#8217;s a whole other rant.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I completely agree, in terms of the kind of less creative, and I see what you mean about it could be controversial by saying that, but correct me if I&#8217;m wrong here, but I feel like when you say that it&#8217;s sort of like, I don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s less kind of verve, there&#8217;s not that sort of spirit or enthusiasm, you mentioned Zaha Hadid, I&#8217;m thinking also of, and this is probably a bit of a stretch in terms of an analogy, but look at things like AI generated arts and how yes, you can input the right functions or whatever and it spits something out that looks good, but it doesn&#8217;t have that human nuance to it, it doesn&#8217;t have that sort of certain je ne sais quoi that would make it really, I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily even say attractive, because these things do look good, but it just doesn&#8217;t have that something, I&#8217;m not sure what the word for it is, but I know what you mean, I think, when you say that.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yeah, well, or even in the instance of the AI generated art, I&#8217;ve seen some of it, which does have that je ne sais quoi, but it&#8217;s getting the prompt of to be influenced by a human being that created that, it&#8217;s still leveraging human ingenuity, it&#8217;s like a collage, a seamless collage, and that I can just go in there and be like, I want to see the Zaha Hadid Tesla truck, and then it&#8217;ll just spit out and be it&#8217;ll be this amazing thing and that okay, but I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;s still going to have this aesthetic and it&#8217;s going to also be inspired by what seems to be a proto fascist, anyway, I can start getting into it, Elon Musk read, we&#8217;ll back away from the Tesla discussion, technology monsters person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was just trying to maybe extrapolate a little bit on what you were sort of saying, I won&#8217;t say the lack of creativity, but I see what you mean about it possibly being less creative because it&#8217;s about, I don&#8217;t know, the output is just different, you&#8217;ve said before that creating great design is easiest when it&#8217;s infused with joy, so maybe that joy is not necessarily in the final product in the same way that it would be if a human did it, I know that there&#8217;s a lot of conversation around AI generated art, chat GPT and all these sorts of technologies that are mimicking what humans have created by hand, but it&#8217;s a really interesting time for seeing where technology can take design, but back to what I said before about what you mentioned with joy, have there been moments in your design career that have been particularly joyful?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely, absolutely, and I think there are times that I look fondly at the times when we&#8217;ve got just a group of us and we&#8217;re just trying to, it may be my developers and writers and designers and we&#8217;re just at our magnet wall and we&#8217;ve just got layouts up and we&#8217;re just trying to figure out how to solve a particular problem and that there&#8217;s the joy part of it, and it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t mean to just to make it simple, be like, well, just somebody tell a joke and that work is going to get better, there&#8217;s the ability to have fun with people and to challenge each other is all that comes from a foundation of trust and that we&#8217;ve got good relationships with people, that we can now start to critique the work and riff off of each other and cut to the chase and be like, &#8220;You know what? This sucks and here&#8217;s why.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that we can kind of laugh about it like, &#8220;Yeah, yeah, I was trying to do this,&#8221; and da da, or, &#8220;This is amazing and it would be even better if we did this,&#8221; that there&#8217;s this kind of lens of bringing more candor to a conversation when you have a trusted group of collaborators where you can push and play and make it so people aren&#8217;t afraid to bring new ideas to the table because nothing is personal and it can be fun, and coming up, I hadn&#8217;t seen this replicated, nor I didn&#8217;t never really embraced it, but in one of my early jobs before I started my agency was at a studio called Group Barnet here in Dallas, and there was a brainstorm room and there was an entire shelf that was just full of hats, bunch of just silly stupid hats like biking hats and clown hats and policeman hats, ship captain hats.</p>
<p>There weren&#8217;t chairs in there, they were all beanbag chairs, right? And so people would need to sit on these beanbag chairs and oftentimes people would go and put on these silly hats, and it was a culture at the agency of it was family-like, and it was fun, but it was definitely served a business purpose and that it was seeding creativity and openness and not taking each other too seriously, and I think it also just kind of keeps you grounded when you&#8217;ve got a stupid clown hat on your head when you&#8217;re saying, &#8220;What if we did it this way?&#8221; So that&#8217;s the utility of it, and otherwise when we&#8217;re just kind of the opposite and we&#8217;re defensive or protective and we&#8217;re not sharing our work and we just kind of work in isolation and just present something when we feel like it&#8217;s perfect and honed and may not be as open to feedback, it&#8217;s just much more difficult to great work that way, in my mind.</p>
<p>And the opposite, it&#8217;s when you&#8217;re wanting to pursue experimentation that I want to be able to just go over to developers and be like, &#8220;What if we did this way?&#8221; And when the page loaded, all these images just exploded and here&#8217;s why and here&#8217;s why it would make sense, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;That&#8217;s impossible,&#8221; to be like, &#8220;Well, look, here&#8217;s a link which did it,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ugh, that&#8217;s ridiculous, that can&#8217;t happen,&#8221; and they come back 10 minutes and then they figured it out, that&#8217;s the kind of stuff that has happened throughout whether my VSA days from the 70kft days to being at Cyxtera, that that&#8217;s the type of atmosphere that I find the most fun and interesting work kind of came out of it.</p>
<p>Just as a closing thought, and we bring that same energy to whether we&#8217;re working on an identity system for a juice bar or helping clients sell cloud computing, to we&#8217;re doing exhibition design for bringing boosting awareness of genocide, which it&#8217;s not to say we&#8217;re not taking it seriously, but this whole notion of building an atmosphere of trust and experimentation so that the team that you&#8217;ve surrounded yourself with, which are hopefully people that are there as your cheerleaders, can be there during critiques or while you&#8217;re working to push and cheer you on, so that&#8217;s that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Something else that you do is you maintain an active presence in social justice efforts through a variety of nonprofits, and you&#8217;ve mentioned that you&#8217;ve focused on eliminating barriers for marginalized designers in the profession and empowering them for success, now, you&#8217;ve kind of spoken a little bit on both of these things earlier, but did you have any sort of more thoughts around either of those?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yeah, and I think that&#8217;s important, and I continue to do work locally with the Dallas Holocaust and Human Rights Museum, which is, I think that was a large relationship that we had in the 70kft days, and we were doing all of their exhibition design and worked on naming and identity work back then, but now I&#8217;m working with them on their marketing committee and on their new facility, and they&#8217;re doing important work here in north Texas to mentoring, whether working with the Adobe Design Circle and helping the scholarships for marginalized designers and mentoring the scholarship designees, other mentoring programs and on continuing relationships with mentees, as I tell all my mentees over the years and I was like, look, you&#8217;ve got me for life if you want me, because I think that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m like, I get the most satisfaction, out of seeing their careers just sore.</p>
<p>But I think when something more tactical and urgent is happening locally that might have gotten involved with political candidates and protest movements, and as I mentioned earlier, it&#8217;s like, look, how can we bring our skills to the table to make sure things are effective? And we kind of worked with a bunch of folks and the local resistance movement back in 2016 to oust the problematic congressman and was bringing my design skills to bear there in a way that made sense, I think we just have to find whatever&#8217;s possible, and I think in as well as within professional associations and mentioned, whether it&#8217;s online groups, whether I try to stay present with black design groups as well, which each had a bit in the past about AIGA and other groups that there&#8217;s just in the design profession period, it&#8217;s important for us to push.</p>
<p>And I try to do that where I think it&#8217;s important that we&#8217;re taking our talents and putting them to use, I&#8217;m like, yes, could I sit down and do a phone bank for my local congressman? Sure, am I going to be more effective by bringing my skills as a designer? Probably, and that I&#8217;m like, what unique skills are you blessed with in this life? What&#8217;s your highest and best use to make that particular cause come to fruition? And so to that part, whether you&#8217;re helping movements, that&#8217;s key, whether you&#8217;re helping talented designers to navigate early career challenges, pitfalls, advice, and I get such satisfaction out of that, and that&#8217;s a high level summary of the stuff that I&#8217;ve been up to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s something that you&#8217;ve let go of that once meant the world to you?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
We&#8217;ve talked a bit about it, but I think it was that agency, I talked a bit about the importance of mental health and how I prioritize starting my day with a ritual that&#8217;s going to kind of make sure that I&#8217;m in a good mood, that starting and growing my own agency was my dream job, that was my dream going back to college, and I did that and I grew it and I was very proud of it, and in the last chapters, I think from there was just enough things that just caught me off guard, clients that let you down, betrayals from people you thought you could trust, that it became such a burden and a drag that I was like, I&#8217;m not happy, and when you look around at all, even looking around at dozens of folks and I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m the only person at this place that cannot quit their job.</p>
<p>Anyone else here can give their two weeks notice except for me, and it&#8217;s definitely the first world problem, right? I&#8217;m like, oh, you&#8217;ve got your own design agency and you&#8217;re sad, that was very much the reality and I realized it was something that in that moment I needed to let go of and I&#8217;m glad I did, and that it&#8217;s definitely something where it&#8217;s a lot of trust where a lot of people can get into, did all this success happen by chance? If I give it up or I&#8217;m going to be able to do it again? It gives you a lot of a key moment of just self-analysis of like, all right, it&#8217;s a giant leap of faith, if I take this change, is this next chapter going to be as rewarding and successful for me? And if I have to do it all over again, can I?</p>
<p>For me, it became important to do that, and that I found a way to make a change with how my team was doing work and to protect their jobs was important for me because I think there had been enough just challenges in the years prior to that that we&#8217;d gone through just things of having a business of that size and going through just firings and layoffs and things where it&#8217;s like business ebbs and flows, it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s just a different animal entirely and it just ate me up and I didn&#8217;t want to go, I just didn&#8217;t want to do anymore, and so letting that go that was probably the answer to that question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does success look like now at this stage of your career?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
I&#8217;m still trying to figure that out, I&#8217;m quite happy working for myself again, there&#8217;s conversations kind of going with really interesting companies that have reached out to me about roles that are a surprisingly compelling fit for my background and passions that I would never have imagined before. But I look at it all, I&#8217;m like, what? One, I&#8217;m like, is it going to bring me joy?</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s key for that joy is knowing that I&#8217;m making some kind of positive impact, that I have space to make a positive impact on the world, that I have the ability to make a positive impact on my family and keep kids in college, one&#8217;s there, I&#8217;ve got two more on the way, to continue to be a good dad and to be a good husband and just to prepare for just a well-balanced life where we can just travel and spend time with friends and family and do what I love. Somewhere in the middle of that is a definition of it, but that&#8217;s very much what I&#8217;m trying to figure out because I spent most of my career focused on that agency, either preparing to start it and grow it from college, and then having done that, I don&#8217;t have that north star anymore, so I&#8217;m trying to figure that out and that&#8217;s kind of exciting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I have to say there is a certain, I don&#8217;t know, exhilaration to not knowing what&#8217;s coming next in a way, there&#8217;s certainly, don&#8217;t get me wrong, stability&#8217;s great, the lore of having a stable paycheck and knowing where the work is coming from is good, but there&#8217;s just something really freeing and exhilarating about just not really knowing what&#8217;s coming up on the horizon, but I don&#8217;t know, to me it&#8217;s very empowering, so I get where you&#8217;re coming from there.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
To that end, where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work would you like to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
In my dream, I was just having a great conversation with this black-owned real estate developer in Portland, and she&#8217;s doing amazing work, and she just started this firm that is just focused on mission-based projects and affordable housing for the black community, and that is their whole focus, and I&#8217;m like, maybe something like that ends up being the goal, and I&#8217;ve mentioned all those things that I would want to have be part of that, but I&#8217;m like, that is kind of the fantasy, right? And that knowing that every aspect of my work life is helping improve society and the black community would be amazing, and if it ends up being a percentage or a portion of my time that&#8217;s going into that, that could be the case too, I think if I can unlock away to kind of have that be the main thing, that would be the fantasy, but in the meantime, I know I&#8217;m going to be heads down working hard, putting these kids through college and hopefully I having some fun along the way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up, where can our audience find out more information about you and your work and everything? Where can they follow you online?</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
GusGranger.com, that is G-U-S-G-R-A-N-G-E-R.com, and that&#8217;s also my handle on the socials, so you can find me on Instagram, we&#8217;ll see if I&#8217;ll continue to be on Twitter, but it&#8217;s the same handle across the board, so you can find me, I&#8217;m pretty easy, if you find another Granger, it might be my dad, but he&#8217;s pretty cool if you want to talk to him.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Gus Granger, thank you so much for coming back on the show, of course, you&#8217;ve been on the show before, but I know we didn&#8217;t talk a lot about kind of, and it was something that we purposely wanted to avoid talking about, but that&#8217;s how we first met, you know what I&#8217;m talking about, I&#8217;m not going to mention it, but-</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I just want to say thank you for being just such a positive influence and role model and mentor and everything, just the work that you&#8217;re doing across design and business, of course, is impressive, but even more so that you&#8217;re really about giving back to the community is something that I certainly look to and I hope a lot of other designers emulate throughout their career, so thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Gus Granger:</b><br>
Well, Maurice, thank you, and I hope you keep this in here, but I want to thank you in the same regard for all the work that you&#8217;re doing, and I know I&#8217;ve been talking to you about this for a while, I&#8217;m like, this podcast is so essential, and I think back to that designer that was in design school that I&#8217;m like, I went through four years and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d been exposed to another black designer other than myself and maybe two others that were in my design program, but the whole notion of being able to be sent a link which has in-depth interviews with now hundreds of black designers, that is amazing, and I&#8217;m so glad that your work has been recognized, whether it&#8217;s with the Steven Heller Award by the Smithsonian, it is impressive and it&#8217;s well deserved and just kudos and I can&#8217;t wait to see what&#8217;s going to come next. Keep doing it.</p>

<p>All it takes is a spark to set off a blaze of creativity, and no one knows that better than our first guest of the year, visual artist Sharon Burton. As a creative coach, her specialty lies in helping people reclaim their creative lives, which I think is a fantastic way to start off 2023.</p>
<p>Sharon talked about her coaching practice <a href="https://www.sparkyourcreative.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Spark Your Creative</a>, described the different courses and services she offers, and spoke on how using joy as resilience is a key part of her work. Sharon also talked about growing up in Philly, working in public health, and shared how her time in Atlanta opened her eyes to her true calling. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a creative spark, then I hope this conversation with Sharon helps you begin this year on the right track! </p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
My name is Sharon Burton, and I consider myself a creative Jill of all trades. I am an artist, visual artist, and I&#8217;m also a poet, and for the last five years, I&#8217;ve been working as a creativity coach, for-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. Everything about me is very much on the creative side. You name it almost, I do it or engage in it or I&#8217;m a patron of it, anything of that nature.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been for you?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting, I&#8217;ve been talking to a few people about that. I think overall, 2022 has been one of the most positive years in the last few years with the pandemic and all that&#8217;s been going on. I think this has been a year that I&#8217;ve been able to really enjoy who I am as a creative person. I&#8217;ve been a part of all of those three things, I&#8217;ve had some positive things that have happened. I&#8217;ve been able to get into some exhibitions back to back, which is not always easy. I had my poetry as being&#8230; was selected to be in a chatbook that includes other poets in this DC, Maryland, Virginia area. So that&#8217;s going to be published soon. I&#8217;ve made tremendous headway in a book that I&#8217;m writing, which we can talk about later. So there&#8217;s been a lot of things that have happened.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s been a year where I was able to focus a little bit more on some things, and I did a lot of spiritual work on abundance early part of the year. And though it didn&#8217;t show up everywhere I wanted it to show up, it did show up, so I can&#8217;t be mad. I have to give things to the universe for allowing me to be able to share my gifts in so many different ways, whether it&#8217;s coaching, whether it&#8217;s doing my own stuff, I&#8217;ve been very, very blessed to have some good things happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s amazing. Were there any particular lessons that you learned this past year? Are there ways that you feel like you&#8217;ve grown and improved?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
One of the biggest things that I&#8217;ve been really focusing on this year is boundaries, because as a creative person, you can find yourself saying yes to a lot of things and wearing yourself out. So being able to set healthy boundaries is probably one of the biggest lessons I&#8217;ve learned this year. I think the other thing is not to&#8230; I don&#8217;t know how to say this, but sometimes you may not feel you&#8217;re getting support for what you do, and to lay back and say, okay, understanding that those that will support you will support you regardless, and those who won&#8217;t won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>And not taking anything seriously, that&#8217;s the other thing. Giving people grace, because one of the major things I think of this time in our nation&#8217;s history and where we are going into 2023 is giving a lot of grace to people. Folks have really just been through it with this whole pandemic, and there&#8217;s a lot of grieving, a lot of grieving, whether it&#8217;s grieving our past way of life, whether it&#8217;s people that have passed through COVID or other things, but I notice people are really dealing with grief and grieving. And I think if you&#8217;re not really grounded as to who you are as a person, this is a tricky time. And sometimes we can get impatient with folks, but if we give people some grace knowing that people are doing the best they can with what they know, I think that&#8217;s the most important thing. So that was the second lesson.</p>
<p>I like this question. No, because I was sitting there thinking the other day, &#8220;Okay, what were some of the major things that I&#8217;ve learned?&#8221; And then I think the third thing is, never too late. Sometimes we think that&#8230; And I work with a lot of people who are interested in engaging their creativity or going back to something that they did creatively when they were younger. I work with a lot of people at middle age. And letting people know that, hey, it doesn&#8217;t matter how long it&#8217;s taken you to get to a certain point, as long as you&#8217;re making strides to that.</p>
<p>Those three things, boundaries, exercising healthy boundaries, exercising grace with people because we&#8217;re reemerging and we&#8217;re trying to get our footing, trying to get back, I think. And I think a lot of people think it&#8217;s just going to be right back to what they used to do and how they did things. And a lot of people, I don&#8217;t think, really realized that this is a new normal, it&#8217;s not&#8230; What you knew and how life was at 2018 is not what it&#8217;s like now. And if you&#8217;re striving for that, you&#8217;re going to be disappointed, but if you&#8217;re open to new opportunities or new ways of doing things, it will be a better situation for you.<br>
But I think also being patient and showing grace to those like our friends and people that we know that are having difficulty and may not realize it, may not realize that they&#8217;re kind of trying to navigate a new world. And that means misunderstandings, that means emotional outbursts, that means a lot of things that&#8230; Maybe we didn&#8217;t know Uncle Joe was that way, he seems so emotional now. And just sort of understanding that Uncle Joe is doing the best he can navigating.</p>
<p>So those, and then the third thing was, yes, it&#8217;s never too late. Yes, it&#8217;s never too late. A lot of things that I felt was too late or I felt I was behind on, I was able to move forward with this year. And I think that people need to know that we can&#8217;t beat ourselves up over what may not have happened at a time that we felt it should have happened. I think we have to trust the universe that those things happen at the time that they&#8217;re supposed to happen. So that&#8217;s how I feel about that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about your coaching business, which is called Spark Your Creative. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Well, Spark Your Creative is about working with people primarily at midlife, those who are over 40, who want to either engage or reclaim their creative life. For example, if you gave up a lot of your creative life because you got married and had kids, or you were kind of shuttled into a different career choice. Those of your listeners that may be in my age group that came up in the &#8217;80s, let&#8217;s say, I graduated from high school in the late &#8217;80s and went to college in the late &#8217;80s, so during that time period, unless you came from a family that was extremely creative, we were not encouraged to go to art school or to engage in these artistic kinds of endeavors that the millennials and Generation Z is being encouraged to do. Now it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh yeah, do it. Do this, do what you want to do.&#8221; But in those days, our parents were about, &#8220;You need to make money.&#8221;</p>
<p>And their viewpoint&#8230; And nothing wrong with that, but that&#8217;s just how it was at that time, it was the starving artist stereotype. &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to make money. You need to go into business.&#8221; And so it was all about business, engineering, healthcare, law, those kinds of activities was really big at that time. And so just like everyone else, I along with a lot of people I know did what we went to school to do to become employable. So that&#8217;s what we did.</p>
<p>And so what I found as I went along is a lot of people were like me that just sort of got derailed from some of their more creative kinds of goals or interests. And I am there to help people kind of develop the confidence and say, &#8220;Okay, it&#8217;s cool. You can do this. You can do this.&#8221; And help them come up with a plan to help them get back on the road to doing whatever it is that they&#8217;re interested in doing creatively. So that might be if they were doing art like visual art, if they were playing an instrument and was interested in going back to that, if they are interested in writing and writing a novel, maybe he&#8217;s always wanted to write a novel, those kinds of things. So it&#8217;s mostly cultural creatives, but I&#8217;m willing to work and have worked with people that, for example, wanted to start a podcast or wanted to put together a portfolio of their creative work. So it can go beyond just coaching and helping them unblock, it can go into some administrative things. That&#8217;s what Spark Your Creative is designed to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does a typical day look like for you, because it sounds like with doing that kind of work, you&#8217;re probably really involved with your clients on a regular basis?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
It depends on the client, and it depends on what&#8217;s going on. If I&#8217;m working on&#8230; For example, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re familiar with The Artist&#8217;s Way by Julia Cameron.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve done several of a course in that book. So sometimes it looks like making sure that people understand what the assignments are and giving them information such as the whole thing with morning pages, writing three long hand pages every morning. Some people, for example, they don&#8217;t know what to write, they&#8217;re just stuck. So it might be providing private portal information and support resources for some of those students or clients or whatever you want to call participants in that course. It might look like sending an email following up on a client session. It might look like doing a call with someone via Zoom or meeting them. And I guess I&#8217;m getting back to meeting in person, so meeting them and talking with them about their creative goals and where they are. It might look like engaging people on social media. It might look like making sure that I get my newsletter out in time. It might look like doing a workshop or promoting a workshop. It&#8217;s all kinds of things, it depends on the day and what&#8217;s going on. So that&#8217;s pretty much it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve mentioned the book that you&#8217;re working on. Are there any sort of other specific projects you&#8217;re doing through Spark Your Creative like workshops or things like that?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Yes. I&#8217;m getting ready to do another Artist&#8217;s Way course, but I&#8217;m going to call it Artist&#8217;s Way Light, because that&#8217;s 12 pages, and that&#8217;s a long time to be in a course. So I&#8217;m going to cut that in half. And I do that with Delray Artisan. So that will most likely be virtual so we can allow for people from different parts of the country to participate. And looking to start that around March of this year. I think the other thing that I will be doing is creating a workshop or a course around my book, which will probably be launched maybe late spring or the fall. We&#8217;re going to see how things go with the book.</p>
<p>And one of the other things I do, I&#8217;m a Yoga Nidra guide, and so I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re familiar with Yoga Nidra, but it&#8217;s basically a meditation style of yoga where you&#8217;re not moving, you&#8217;re just still, and you listen to a person kind of lead you through several levels of consciousness. And it&#8217;s a great tool for people who are creative and need a way to unblock. And so I plan to do more of those. I was doing them around the full moon&#8230; Or not the full moon, the new moon each month, so I may be doing that again or might be doing it more around the solstices. So we&#8217;ll see how that goes. So those are just a few of the things I&#8217;m going to be doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you also have a podcast too, you&#8217;re doing a lot.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Yes, I have a podcast, and that&#8217;s the Spark Your Creative podcast. And the one thing I love about that podcast is that it gives me an opportunity to talk to creatives in real time about a variety of different subjects regarding creativity. And I&#8217;ve done some series&#8217; dealing with everything from creating during uncertain times, particularly in the midst of the pandemic and the social upheaval and trying to help creative stay focused. Filling The Well is one that I did that is focusing on self-care for yourself and staying mentally and physically and emotionally healthy so you can create. But then I also interview people on a variety of different topics that are of interest to creatives, whether it&#8217;s creative anxiety, whether it&#8217;s working with essential oils, whether it&#8217;s working in a creative community, just a variety of different things.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s one of my favorite aspects of my business, and it&#8217;s a wonderful way to outreach to people on topics that they may not hear otherwise. There&#8217;s a lot of, of course, creative podcasts out there, but I like to think that I do it kind of unique. And I try to engage and invite guests that are in the age group of my target population, so they see themselves or hear themselves talking about these different issues.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that sounds great. I&#8217;ll make sure that we include a link to the podcast in the show notes so people can get a chance to check it out.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, when you&#8217;re starting on a project, and it sounds like there&#8217;s a lot of projects that you&#8217;re working on, what does your creative process look like?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
That&#8217;s interesting. I think it really depends on what it is and what&#8217;s driving me and inspiring me at the moment. For my business, a lot of my inspiration comes from the input I get from clients and people that engage in my workshops. So if they talk about something or share a source of frustration or something that they need help with, that helps me to create programs, workshops, the book, that I can provide them as a way of support. And so once I get the idea, it&#8217;s just sort of mapping it out, talking to people. What would be engaging to you, what format, and then go with that. And that might be a podcast, it might be a blog, it might be a workshop, so it depends. And most likely, there&#8217;s probably at least two out of the three that I do. It could end up being a podcast and a blog or a workshop and a podcast or some variation of the three.</p>
<p>So once I get the ideal going, I just map it out and let it flow. Sometimes it can be really quick, like if I do blog topics, I just knock it out in an hour or so. If it&#8217;s a podcast idea, that would take longer because I&#8217;m usually looking for someone that could really be engaging or has a perspective that I think that would be of interest to people, so they would be able to listen and find that person interesting. And by the way, with podcasts, I don&#8217;t do famous people. I mean, if I do, I have interviewed a few popular people in the creativity field, but for the most part, I just try to do everyday people because I want my audience to know that it&#8217;s not about popular people who have resources and all this other stuff that can do these things. I want people that sound like them. &#8220;I&#8217;m balancing taking care of my grandma or my mother and getting these kids into college and&#8230;&#8221; Those kinds of people.</p>
<p>So yes, there are some people that appear on there that if you&#8217;re in the creativity field, but for the most part, my audience is not necessarily following those people. They may not even know who they are. I know them, but they&#8217;re not impressed by that they&#8217;re impressed with the topic. And the podcast that I have with regular people just sharing their truth is the ones I get feedback on the most, so yeah.</p>
<p>Now, as far as my own creative practice with my art, I decided to focus on looking at the &#8217;40s, the &#8217;50s and the &#8217;60s, which wasn&#8217;t that long ago. But those were crazy and very dark. And it could be very dark times with the exception of the &#8217;60s with civil rights really coming into view and things moving and changing. But particularly the &#8217;40s and the &#8217;50s because, and even earlier, because there was so much going on, there was lynchings that were still happening, there was a lot of violence, a lot of miscarrying of justice. And I wanted to find photos where people were smiling, where people were showing joy because it was a reminder to me that despite what I feel is crazy town right now, these people, my ancestors, your ancestors, our relatives, people still found a way to find joy through those dark times. And if they could give us an example about how they used joy as resilience, as a way of resilience, that could kind of inform us.</p>
<p>So I started the series called Joy and Resilience, and it&#8217;s been a blessing because those works have been placed in a lot of different exhibitions. And I&#8217;m still working on it, I&#8217;m still creating work as part of that series. And so when I think of my creative process, the social unrest, all of that, because that was new to your generation and mine, we didn&#8217;t experience all that. I was born in the &#8217;60s, so I wasn&#8217;t conscious when a lot of things were going on. It&#8217;s been my way also of feeling some sort of kinship with my ancestors and with others saying that, &#8220;Okay, we&#8217;ll survive this. We&#8217;ll survive this.&#8221; So that inspired my creative process, and that inspired the photographs that I chose and the kinds of images I wanted to convey with that art.</p>
<p>Poetry has been a little different. It seems like relationships kind of got to that. It was my way of dealing with relationships that went sideways or relationships that I was enjoying. It just seems like whoever I&#8217;m dating&#8230; And not everybody, but certain people I&#8217;ve dated have been the muse for me to share my thoughts in writing. Out of all of the different creative processes, that&#8217;s been the most spontaneous. That&#8217;s like you get on the subway or the metro here, and I take my phone, something will come in my head and I&#8217;ll just write it all out. That&#8217;s how it comes to me for the poetry. So that&#8217;s funny because that has a whole different muse, that has a whole different process, where the others have a little bit more, I don&#8217;t know, research or contemplation to it, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, that makes sense. I mean, I think it&#8217;s really interesting that your different creative practices kind of have these different, I don&#8217;t know, sources of inspiration, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Yeah, and ways of showing up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
But I think it&#8217;s cool, and that makes things so interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s kind of learn more about your origin story. I mean, you&#8217;ve kind of alluded a bit to it just now earlier, but tell me about where you grew up, where you&#8217;re originally from.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Well, I was born in the Philadelphia, but I was raised primarily in Upstate New York, near Syracuse, New York.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Know anything about that part of the country or that part of the state? Which is what they call Central New York, Central Upstate New York. So I went to school and graduated from high school and all that up there. My parents were very encouraging to me with art. I think that your parents have great things and not so great things, but one of the great things about my parents were they created a atmosphere for me to be a creative being. And so I really give them props for that because I hear a lot of people talk about where their parents didn&#8217;t seem to encourage them to create at all, but that was not the case in my household.</p>
<p>And then I went to college in Virginia at St. Paul&#8217;s, and that was sort of the point where I kind of got derailed from the whole art thing. Even though they encouraged that, it was not something&#8230; It was more or less, at least with my dad anyway, that if you&#8217;re going to do college and if I&#8217;m going to pay for it, art thing is nice, but maybe you take that up later. I think you should consider a major that you&#8217;re going to make some money and be able to live. And so I ended up going and getting a business degree in marketing. And then I worked for a while after that. When I was in college, I didn&#8217;t do any art stuff at all. No art. A lot of my peers did not know I was an artist until really in the last 10 years, they didn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Yeah, because of Facebook. They didn&#8217;t know. And a lot of people were shocked about it because I didn&#8217;t do it while I was there. It just&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I think about that sometimes. But anyway, I went to work in the public sector. That was not planned. I was planning to work in the corporate and private sector, but I had opportunities in the public sector, so I did that. Primarily in public health, which was very different than my major. But I had a love of that, particularly social marketing, which was the term before social media, but social marketing. And you probably know a lot about that anyway, about the types of campaigns and stuff that focus on behavior change.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
And so I really liked that. And so after I lived in Richmond, Virginia, for a few years and then decided to get my master&#8217;s, I went to Clark-Atlanta, and I got a job down there too. So I was working and going to school. And I really liked the public sector, so I got my master&#8217;s in public administration there. But that&#8217;s when the whole art thing started coming back. I was working, had graduated and started working for a major government agency down there. And every time&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re based in Atlanta or know Atlanta really well, but at that time they had Atlanta School of the Arts there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
And every time I would come downtown, I lived in the burbs, but when I would come downtown to go somewhere or whatever on 75 South, and right there where 75 and 85 merges, if you&#8217;re coming from the north, if you look on your right, you would&#8217;ve saw the school title. It&#8217;s now Savannah School of Art or part of that. And I used to be like&#8230; I started getting these little&#8230; Kind of little taps in my head, I guess. I don&#8217;t know. It was just like this little voice would say, &#8220;Okay, you need to sign up for some classes over there.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;What?&#8221; And it would always happen.</p>
<p>And it got to the point I wouldn&#8217;t even look at the school, because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this.&#8221; And at that time, I was in my early 30s, so I was like&#8230; Now it&#8217;s nothing, but at that age I felt like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to be the oldest one in the classroom, and what makes me think I&#8217;m an artist? And maybe that was just in my head? How can you call yourself an artist? You haven&#8217;t done this stuff in&#8230; You&#8217;re not an artist, you&#8217;re just going to make a fool out of yourself.&#8221; And it kept me from doing it.</p>
<p>But on a dare, a very good friend of mine at the time when I was&#8230; I think it was the summer before I started working at the agency or before. Anyway, we were working together on a project, and she kind of dared me to volunteer for the National Black Arts Festival. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re familiar with that, but-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Yeah. And that year, it was interesting because it was a lot of stuff going on. I had been working so hard, I didn&#8217;t even realize that that was part of the culture down there. And somehow she brought that to my attention, and I was like, &#8220;Okay, cool.&#8221; We signed up, and I became a docent for one of the exhibitions. Actually, it was a doll exhibition, which was interesting because my sister ended up a taking up creating dolls, which was&#8230; Now that I think of it, that was so wild how that happened. But I also went to&#8230; Clark-Atlanta has a gallery.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm, on Park Street</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Yes. And went there, and they were talking about the exhibition that was there. At the time, it was To Preserve a Legacy, which was artwork from a number of historically black colleges and universities from across the country. I mean, it was just a jaw dropping&#8230; For me, it just changed everything. That&#8217;s all I could say. I learned so much about the art and about these different colleges&#8217; collections. I went through the little docent training over there at Clark-Atlanta and the stuff that they were saying, and they&#8217;re talking about these pieces and these artists. And I went to lectures at Spelman that they had that summer with different artists. I mean, it just blew my mind.</p>
<p>And there was something that was lit inside of me. The following year or two, I ended up moving up here to take a job in Washington DC, and within two years, I think, two or three years, I started taking art classes. One starting off at the Smithsonian and then some of the local art centers in this area, and started showing my work. But yeah, Atlanta was it for me. That whole thing was just&#8230; It was just unexpected. Every time I think about it, a smile comes on my face because I was like&#8230; It was just so much fun, and we were around all these different people, and I was learning so much, and it was just sort of like, &#8220;Wow, all this is going on.&#8221; But that&#8217;s how it happened.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. So as you&#8217;re mentioning all of this, I mean, I live in Atlanta, I live near the AUC, so I know about Spelman, I know about Clark, I know about the church over on Park Street where Clark-Atlanta&#8217;s art department is, even the National Black Arts Festival. I don&#8217;t know if&#8230; Does the name Leatrice Ellzy, does that sound familiar to you?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
She was the executive director. I think she still is the executive director. She was there for a while, at least when I was working with the National Black Arts Festival. I don&#8217;t know if&#8230; It doesn&#8217;t sound like she might have been affiliated with them yet, but I am familiar with the National Black Arts Festival. It still takes place here. I think it still does. But yeah, it&#8217;s so interesting how Atlanta, I guess, I don&#8217;t know, sparked your creativity in a way. You were looking at, seeing the Atlanta College of Art, and then you&#8217;re getting inspired by Spelman and by Clark. I really love to hear that, because I think when people think of HBCUs, they don&#8217;t necessarily think of design and art and creativity and-</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; it sounds like for you it was kind of the opposite, you really kind of got inspired by that.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s interesting because art and creativity apparently was very much a part of a lot of these schools. And it&#8217;s kind of interesting because when I was working with that particular program and learning so much about these different HBCUs and how they had really thriving art programs and there was a few renowned African American artists that were working at these schools, I was like, &#8220;Wow, this is some serious stuff.&#8221; And it&#8217;s not something that, as you said, that&#8217;s really talked that much about, and that was the magic to Preserve a Legacy, that particular exhibition. And I still have the catalog from that show and the poster. And matter of fact, when you first enter my home, that&#8217;s the first thing you see, is that poster.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
And it just sort of gives me a sense of what I&#8217;m doing and why I&#8217;m doing it. And I will also dare say, it&#8217;s interesting, though my college was not represented in that exhibition, art was very much a part of that years ago. Matter of fact, weekend before last, some sorority sisters and I, we all pledged together, we kind of did a reunion weekend. And one of the things that we did was went by a program office that&#8217;s affiliated with the college. The college has closed, but they still are working on a number of different projects down there. And they just reopened a portion of St. Paul&#8217;s. And we went to visit, and it was interesting, there was these old yearbooks that they had around. And you had a chance to read through them. There were some from my era, and I was like, &#8220;Ooh, I guess we&#8217;re archival now.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was some older ones. And there was also some photographs and information about an artist in residence that was at St. Paul&#8217;s, and how this artist was working with the students on a lot of art projects and everything. And I said, &#8220;Wow, this is something&#8230; Art has always been a part of African American culture and a part of the academic or academia.&#8221; And it&#8217;s something that I think, as you said, we don&#8217;t talk about it that much. I think the last time I did see something was&#8230; I was in New Orleans. One of the Historically Black Colleges there had the work of their students at one of the museums downtown. And I thought that was really cool to see that.</p>
<p>And I can&#8217;t remember which school or which museum, but it was good to see that. So I think that&#8217;s something, as you said, I would really like to see. There&#8217;s a lot of emphasis on HBCUs right now, and I really would like to see somebody really revitalize that particular exhibition, maybe put a different twist to it, maybe include a more contemporary artist than what they had in the traveling show back then, because there&#8217;s a lot of younger artists that are in different generations that I think should be showcased, and to let people know that, hey, a lot of art and culture is based at HBCUs. So I think that that&#8217;s definitely something to think about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think that would be fantastic, definitely.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
I would love it. Oh gosh, I would love it, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, you got inspired in Atlanta, you moved up to the DMV, what kind of made you decide to strike out on your own with starting Spark Your Creative?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Well, prior to once I got here, I was involved in another entrepreneurial effort. That one, it actually had two&#8230; Well, the first iteration was Authentic Art Consulting, and then it was Artinista Art Advisory. And both of them were focused more on&#8230; Well, the first one was focused more on working with artists and art locations to put together curated art shows of emerging artists in the DC area. So I was doing a lot of art exhibitions and collaborating with different people on creative activities and showcasing visual art and visual artists in this area. And then I decided I wanted to focus more on the collector, making sure that art education for the collector. So I started the Artinista Art Advisory primarily was to focus on women who wanted to add art to their portfolios as a way of investment.</p>
<p>And so I did those, and then I became&#8230; I guess the word disenchanted with the art world. Well, it&#8217;s funny, I had hurt my back. These things start with weird&#8230; I hurt my back in 2015, and I found myself basically flat on my back trying to heal. And something just told me, &#8220;This is not for me.&#8221; The art world is a little&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re involved with fine art world where you are or know how that world works, but it&#8217;s very&#8230; It can be glamorous, but it can be very cold, and it can be a little cutting too if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing. And I became disenchanted with some of that vibe. And I felt I wanted to continue to work in the field, but I just didn&#8217;t feel like I wanted to do exhibitions anymore or interface with museum people and galleries and&#8230; Yeah, I just didn&#8217;t want to do it anymore.</p>
<p>And it was wearing me down, and I didn&#8217;t think my personality fit that. I&#8217;m more of a touchy-feely girl. I wasn&#8217;t hardcore. I was really into the artists and what their vision was and not necessarily, well, you got to sell this stuff and blah, blah. It just wasn&#8217;t working. And a few things had happened, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think this&#8230;&#8221; And so, I really had been toying with the fact of creativity coaching. And I&#8217;ve known about it, but I just didn&#8217;t&#8230; and kind of looked at it, but never followed through. And so I decided to do it because I was like&#8230; A lot of artists were talking to me about how to do things, and I felt that worked more with my personality than working on that side. So I became certified and started working kind of doing workshops and stuff in that rein, that area, and just enjoyed talking to artists and just enjoyed that whole process. And so it worked out well for me.</p>
<p>And I think that&#8217;s something to say too, when it comes back to it&#8217;s never too late or whatever, if you got to pivot, pivot. I think sometimes people get&#8230; And it was hard because people knew me in one area. Some people were a little resistant to deal with this other area. So rebranding yourself can be tough, but my thing is, do it, do if you need to do it. And I probably will rebrand again. One of the things that I&#8217;m really interested in outside of really dealing with artists and working with them is also working with regular folks and lay folks to deal with some of the stuff that&#8217;s going on where people need a way to express themselves, whether it&#8217;s grief, whether it&#8217;s whatever. And so that&#8217;s probably a new direction that I&#8217;ll be going on in some way in the next two years as well. There&#8217;s always something going on with Sharon Burton. She&#8217;s always thinking about something.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m glad you mentioned this part about pivoting. We had someone on the show a couple of episodes ago, Nikita Pope, who was also talking about the power of pivoting and knowing when you have the opportunity to do so and just going kind of forward with it. I think it takes a lot of confidence to be able to do that. And I think we&#8217;re releasing this episode at the start of the year. It seems like you have a boundless supply of creative confidence, just from what you&#8217;ve talked about so far. For people out there that are listen, what advice would you give them to build their confidence up and help engage their creativity?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
I think one of the things that I try to make sure people understand, that we&#8217;re all creative. And that might sound trite and all that, but it&#8217;s really true. We all have creativity inside us, it&#8217;s whether or not we want to engage that. So my thing is, acknowledge that you are creative no matter what. Even if you can&#8217;t draw a straight line or play an instrument, or, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do&#8230; Get rid of all that, because you are creative. For example, I know people that are great with their makeup. I mean, this is a weird situation, but this is an example. People are artistic with&#8230; Women that put eyeshadow on and eyeliner and all that. You know that&#8217;s a form of artwork?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a form of adornment. And so if you can make your eyes and shade those colors and make everything pop and sing and whatever with your face, you can do art. And people don&#8217;t even think about it, but it shows up in different ways. So the first thing is, acknowledge that you&#8217;re creative. The second thing is, just like they talk about in business, and I&#8217;m not saying art has to be a business, but also think about this, what is your why? A lot of people are saying that now, &#8220;What is your why? Why are you doing this?&#8221; Well, what is it, what is your why? why Are you thinking about doing something creative? Is it just a stress reliever? Is it that, &#8220;Oh, I want to show my work in a gallery, or I want to recite poetry at these spoken word things.&#8221; Or is just, &#8220;I just want to share it with my family?&#8221; Be clear on what your why is.</p>
<p>And I say that because some people, when it comes to creative kinds of endeavors, you automatically find yourself comparing yourself to other people. And when you compare yourself to other people, that tells me that you&#8217;re lost on what your why is. Because if you&#8217;re doing this for you or you&#8217;re doing this to fulfill a dream that you have, it&#8217;s not about all these other people. But if you find yourself getting frustrated because, oh, she just posted that on Instagram and that&#8217;s way better than mine, and I ain&#8217;t going to show that, was that your why?</p>
<p>Were you going to be competing against these people, or do you saw yourself that? Or were you saying, &#8220;I want to share my art with the world. I want to make people happy.&#8221; If you&#8217;re not clear on your why, you can get derailed very easily. And yes, there&#8217;s always going to be somebody better than you, whether it&#8217;s music, poetry, dance, you name it, graphic design. There&#8217;s always going to be somebody better than you. But is that your goal to do this? Is it for joy? Is it because you want to exercise creative freedom or whatever? Be clear on that because that&#8217;s going to be your North Star when things don&#8217;t go so well.</p>
<p>And then I think the other thing is to find a community or a group of people that are doing what you&#8217;re interested in doing, and get involved with them. That could be an art group, it could be a music group, it could be a poetry group. And make sure that they&#8217;re supportive of you. You don&#8217;t want something that&#8217;s like people are just way advanced and you&#8217;re coming in as a beginner, but you want a group that maybe takes people at different levels that provide workshops and professional development and support for you. That&#8217;s something that I really recommend. I wish I could have done that a little earlier than what I did.</p>
<p>I think the other thing is just to go ahead and try and just find ways to carve out time in your schedule, whether it&#8217;s daily or weekly, to get it done. Now, a lot of people say, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t have time.&#8221; Yeah, you do have time. You have time when you&#8217;re scrolling your social media, you have time when you&#8217;re doing all these other things. It&#8217;s putting it on your calendar and making it a priority just like anything else in finding ways to do that. So those are my tips.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Those are some good tips. I like that. I think it is important to kind of really&#8230; It&#8217;s funny you say, &#8220;What is your why?&#8221; I know in business, I think they call that your USP, your unique selling proposition or something like that. But finding out the why behind why you&#8217;re doing what you want to do is important, because that really is going to fuel you when perhaps it&#8217;s not taking off in the way that you want to. Maybe it&#8217;s not becoming an instant success or you&#8217;re not instantly getting some sort of a claim for it, but if you have an underlying reason and a passion behind why you&#8217;re doing it, that&#8217;s what will fuel you.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Definitely. And again, instead of&#8230; Because it&#8217;s just when you don&#8217;t have a why, you get derailed. One person says something about your art, and then you ain&#8217;t doing it no more. &#8220;I&#8217;m not an art&#8230;&#8221; You have to be clear on what your why is and let that be your guide. And a note on that, we have critics and we have people that provide healthy advice. And you&#8217;re going to get judged putting your stuff out there, whether it&#8217;s poetry, writing, music, if you&#8217;re into performance, you&#8217;re putting yourself out there, and it takes a certain amount of bravery to do it. I have gotten to the point I don&#8217;t care what people think.</p>
<p>And I guess maybe I&#8217;ve also developed a style that has improved over time. But what gets me is that when I get into a juried show, that means somebody has picked my work and they think it&#8217;s good enough to be a part of this show. And that, to me, is important. Whether it sells or not doesn&#8217;t matter to me. My thing, it&#8217;s being shown. I am contributing to the world with my art. Someone sees it, and that&#8217;s important to me. If I sell it, that&#8217;s just a piece of cake, that&#8217;s icing on the cake. But if I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t let it bother me because eventually I do sell it, or I give it as a gift, or it ends up being donated somewhere. It gets a home. I&#8217;m also lucky that I don&#8217;t rely on my art to live. Maybe I would be a little different if that was the case, but I&#8217;m blessed to be able to create, I&#8217;m blessed to be able to take a theme and interpret that and put that out there for people. That&#8217;s good for me.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s my why. My why is about providing beauty, about sharing my gift to the world. Whether you see it as a gift or not, I don&#8217;t care. But it&#8217;s taken me a while. Because I used to feel some kind of way about my art, but I also know I&#8217;ve improved. And that&#8217;s the other thing too, if you feel that you&#8217;re not at the level you want to be, you can always take classes in anything. And now it&#8217;s even&#8230; So if you don&#8217;t find something near you, you can take something virtually. It&#8217;s not like it used to be where&#8230; Well, nobody&#8217;s doing violin lessons in this area. Well, get online, see if somebody&#8217;s doing it on Zoom or something. There&#8217;s a lot of more opportunities than there used to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah, absolutely. You mentioned earlier that you&#8217;re in the process of writing a book. Is the book going to be about this kind of thing, about inspiring people to pursue their creative dreams?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Most definitely. This is a book of affirmations and creativity tips for creatives at midlife. And it actually deals with a lot of common things that creatives deal with, whether it&#8217;s dealing with certain blocks, naysayers, people that talk about them or they&#8217;re not encouraging of their creative life. And then it has affirmations. And I also encourage you to create your own affirmation. So it&#8217;s not just, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m just going to use the affirmation that she puts in there.&#8221; No, I have some journaling exercises where I ask you, &#8220;Take a look at, okay, if it was a naysayer, where did you hear that before? Who was the first person that said something crazy about your art or your creative endeavor?&#8221; And then one thing that people don&#8217;t pay attention to, let&#8217;s say on Facebook or something like that, people post things and there&#8217;s always somebody that says something positive about what you post, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
But we don&#8217;t pay attention to that. We don&#8217;t, we get caught up in this person over here that says something negative. And so my thing is, go on your page, go on wherever you are, and last time&#8230; Even if you emailed it to somebody and they said something, let&#8217;s write down what those folks said, because those are the people that are in your corner, and those are the people that are talking to you in a positive way and encouraging you. And those are the types of messages you need to hear. So that&#8217;s an example of that. And then I challenge people to write their own affirmations based on those messages that they can see and they can put up in their studio or whatever, and wherever in the house that reminds them that they are worthy and that they are a creative and what they&#8217;re doing is positive and good. So that&#8217;s what the book is about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now? I mean, I feel like you&#8217;re kind of in this renaissance period almost with all these creative things that you&#8217;re working on.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a very good question, Maurice. I think I&#8217;m at a place where I can show up the way that I want to. It&#8217;s taken me a long time to do that. When I was in my 20s and 30s, I was not comfortable showing up as a poet or as an artist. I didn&#8217;t even think I was really an artist. I just thought, &#8220;Well, that must have been something I like to do, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m an artist.&#8221; Yeah, no, I was an artist. I am an artist. I like the fact that I can do poetry, I can do art, two things that I truly love. And even writing, this has been probably&#8230; Writing this book has been probably one of my most challenging things I&#8217;ve ever done. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever written a book, but it is no joke, really.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not. I&#8217;m working on my book now, actually.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s no joke.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
It is no joke, okay. And procrastination and all this stuff that goes&#8230; I probably go through now, maybe because this is new, this is where my creative confidence is not as strong maybe as it is in those other areas, but it&#8217;s also new and it&#8217;s also different. But I think the thing I do like now, if something, not that I&#8217;m wishing anything to happen, nor am I bringing that energy in, but if something were to happen to me, I think I can say I am at a point in my life where I&#8217;m not afraid of my self-expression, whether people like it or not. And I think to get here, it took a long time because it took a lot of courage, it took a lot of work on myself and self-awareness, period, to be able to express myself in two ways that I love.</p>
<p>Even though I did visual art first, I did write a lot as a teenager. As a pre-teen and teenager, I wrote a lot of&#8230; They were actually song lyrics. They were music in my head, and I would just write the words to them. But poetry, that&#8217;s what it is really. And so I was doing both since I was very young. And to return to it and to return to it and the way that I&#8217;ve had, which is beyond my expectation or my dreams, to me, is awesome. It is just awesome to be in exhibitions, to have my poetry in a chatbook with some other poets that I admire and have that published, without me contributing any money. Hello. All of that. It&#8217;s magic. It&#8217;s just beautiful to me. I feel really humbled that the universe has allowed me to do that.</p>
<p>And a lot of people, they get my age and they&#8217;ve never done any of those things. And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to let people know that you can do that. I&#8217;m nothing special, except that I had the time and a little bit of the resources to make some things happen. And some things I just fell into. Like the poetry book, I fell into that group. I didn&#8217;t even know when I joined them. I didn&#8217;t know they were trying to put together a book. I just was in there and nobody said nothing. We just talked, and next thing I know, they said, &#8220;All right, we&#8217;re going to get the book together.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What book?&#8221; So I think sometimes you&#8217;re just in the right place at the right time with the right people. And it&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m not trying to be at Art Basel in Miami or at the art fairs in New York. If that happened, that&#8217;s beautiful, but that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m doing all this for. I&#8217;m doing it for me. It&#8217;s doing it to share my love to the world. And to be able to do that in two things I love, oh, not many people can say that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
I&#8217;m blowing my own mind right now talking about it Because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t even thought about that question/&#8221; Well, that&#8217;s serious. That&#8217;s a serious question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, to that-</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
A lot of people can&#8217;t say anything about that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, to that end, where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing? What sort of new work do you want to be doing, that kind of thing?</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
Well, I think what I&#8217;d like to do is, of course, continue with both the poetry and the visual art. With my business, I&#8217;d like to expand that to be more therapeutic for people because we&#8217;ve just gone through so much right now. And no matter who you are, what your color is or your background, we all have survived a very major upheaval in time. Sometimes, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s enough support for people. There&#8217;s not enough therapy, and some people aren&#8217;t comfortable with traditional kinds of things. And I think I want to be in a position to help people work through their self, to open themselves to self-expression in a different way.</p>
<p>I have a very good friend of mine who&#8217;s been through a lot. I feel he has problems expressing himself and processing a lot that has happened to him. And I think if he were to do something creative, I think he would find a way to express himself and lift that load without feeling too vulnerable. And I think a lot of people are like that. Some people are in denial that they&#8217;re not happy or that they&#8217;re not able to&#8230;</p>
<p>I know another friend who&#8217;s&#8230; She&#8217;s very stoic and kind of comes off as if, well, these things happen and blah, blah blah. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;But you just lost your mother, and we&#8217;re going through COOVID, and all this other stuff.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like she acts like she didn&#8217;t lose her mom or any&#8230; I mean, she&#8217;s upset about it, but you can tell she just pushes and pushes, but she&#8217;s not expressing herself, she&#8217;s not letting it out. And that causes conflict with people. And people will say, &#8220;Well, so-and-so is a B and blah, blah, blah.&#8221; Well, they may not really be that way, they&#8217;re just not expressing themselves about the grief and the hurt and the trauma that they&#8217;ve experienced over here. And they may be using you as a punching bag because that&#8217;s the only thing that they can do. That&#8217;s the only thing they feel comfortable doing.</p>
<p>So I think a lot of people could use art in a way because when you express yourselves artistically, sometimes, yeah, you&#8217;re vulnerable, but it&#8217;s a different kind of vulnerability than you saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m drowning over here. I need help.&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Sharon Burton:</b><br>
I think particularly my generation, we don&#8217;t do a lot to take care of our mental health, as we should. I think we&#8217;re learning to from the younger generation and getting a clue, but I think men and women need a lot of help. They need to work through their grief, they need to work through their anger. And a lot has happened, even before COVID and all that. But I always tell people, COVID brought out everybody&#8217;s inner child, and whatever you were dealing with as a child, COVID came right on out when people were told, &#8220;You stay in, and wear a mask, and stay six feet away from people.&#8221; People fought it, they fought that.</p>
<p>And then those that didn&#8217;t fight it, now that we&#8217;re coming out of it, it&#8217;s coming back, the pent up stuff. And if you&#8217;re not aware of what was going on with you as a kid&#8230; I&#8217;m not a therapist or anything, so please. But we have to be aware of ourselves, we have to be aware of our triggers are. And I think that art is one way that you can get it out without harming other people. It&#8217;s a good way. So I see myself doing more on a little more therapeutic side. I really want to do expressive art and work with people on that. I think that that&#8217;s needed, and I think that&#8217;s going to be needed for some time now, so yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>

<p>We&#8217;re wrapping up 2022 by sitting down with the immensely talented Shakeil Greeley. I love that his portfolio consists of all kinds of creative projects, including fine art and writing. Who says design has to be all about visuals?</p>
<p>Shakeil and I started off talking about his work as an art director at Splice, as well as his new role at Spring Health. He also talked about growing up between Portland and Philly, studying at the University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s Visual Studies program, and then landing at GQ doing digital art direction and editorial strategy. Shakeil also spoke about the <a href="https://imaginaryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Imaginary School</a> and the <a href="https://www.aroko.coop/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">&Agrave;r&ograve;ko Cooperative</a> (formerly Design to Divest), and shared how both projects are important to him in terms of community building.</p>
<p>There are so many opportunities to use design to make the world a better place, and I&#8217;m glad that there are designers like Shakeil Greeley who are using their skills to make that happen.</p>
<p>From all of us here at Revision Path, thank you for all your support this year. Next year marks our 10th anniversary, so stick around for what&#8217;s coming up in 2023!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Hey there. My name is Shakeil Greeley. I am a creative director and designer based in Brooklyn, New York. And I use design, strategy, and art to create more equitable, open, and imaginative worlds.</p>
<p>So in my day job, I&#8217;m an art director at a music company called Splice. Although I&#8217;m soon to be moving on to a new role as creative director of a mental healthcare company. In addition to that, I&#8217;m on the leadership teams of two organizations in particular. √Är√≤ko Cooperative, which is a Black owned design cooperative. And The Imaginary School, which is an online learning community and platform.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, that&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
It is. I stay very busy, and that&#8217;s not including any of the freelance work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, how was 2022 for you?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
2022 was frankly not the best year. I think it was a lot of time to just kind of process a lot of things that had gone on. Obviously, 2020 was very hectic for many reasons, as was 2021. And I think 2022, I definitely felt a lot of the emotional burnout from just the large existential events that were happening in the pandemic, and racial uprisings, and geopolitical developments, and such.</p>
<p>But also from just working a lot over the last 10 years basically. I&#8217;m one of those people who always has multiple side projects running and I think I&#8217;ve probably had three or four large side projects running at all times since I was a junior in college. And I think that really caught up to me after a while coming into this year. So it&#8217;s been a year of just rest, and reflection, and de-stressing, and unplugging that has definitely been productive. But I&#8217;m really looking forward to the things that are going to come in the next year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of that, is there anything from this year that you want to carry over into the next year?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I think one of the biggest things is my work with √Är√≤ko, because that has been an ongoing project for a number of years now, and we&#8217;re really getting to a spot where I think going into next year we&#8217;re going to be able to have folks working on that project for the first time. So all of the work we&#8217;ve been doing to kind of reposition because we were formally known as Design to Divest. So coming up with a mew name, new brand direction, and new strategy, all of that work has been really fruitful. And I&#8217;m really excited for that stuff to carry on into the new year, in particular in my kind of design practice and work practice.</p>
<p>But on a more personal note, I think just continuing to be reflective and really take time for myself. Those are two things that I&#8217;m really prioritizing the next year to not overwhelm myself with work, and just maintain a nice steady output while giving myself plenty of time to just relax and enjoy the fruits of my labor a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I heard that from a lot of people this year that I&#8217;ve had on the show that this year has kind of been a bit of almost a rebuilding year in some ways. And I think it&#8217;s because 2020 for a lot of us was just very hectic, aside from the racial reckoning, and the protest, and things that happened during the year. But just the pandemic on top of that with also not being able to travel and congregate and stuff. 2020 was really stressful for a lot of people. 2021, I think we were trying to emerge from it. And now this year, especially with boosters and with mandates becoming lax and things of that nature, we&#8217;re just trying to get back to some semblance of normalcy. Which I think for a lot of people this year that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s been. It&#8217;s been about trying to find ways to move forward when take the lessons that we&#8217;ve learned from the past couple of years on how to live in a more equitable kind of holistic sort of way.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Definitely. Yeah, I definitely feel that. So much has happened, and even heard in a couple of your recent interviews folks talking about the influx of things like clients, and new projects, and all of that after 2020. I know even on our end, we&#8217;re really having time to take stock and be like, &#8220;Okay, what are the kind of clients we actually really want to be taking on, and what are the kind of principles we want to be adhering to when we accept new projects?&#8221; And even for my own personal work I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Okay, I have limited time. I have limited energy, and I have a very specific set of goals I&#8217;m looking to accomplish in the world. What are the actual side projects I should be working on and doing at any given time?&#8221; And the conclusion has been maybe only one instead of the suite that I had been operating with previously.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now I know you mentioned that you are about to leave Splice. But you&#8217;ve served there as art director roughly for about what the past four years or so now. Talk to me about your work there.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So Splice has been a really interesting journey. I joined in February of 2019 and worked primarily on all their editorial and content marketing channels. So that includes the Splice blog, that includes Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, Reels. I also assist on things like video thumbnails and video ideas, and also focus onto things like content planning and content strategy. In addition to that, obviously there&#8217;s a whole art direction side. So that includes doing art direction for brand photo shoots where we are going to go cast 10 musicians from around New York City and shoot them in their own spaces and places, to shooting more kind of advertising focused shoots with sets, and set designers, and things that are a little more formalized.</p>
<p>So my work has really spanned a lot of different stuff in my time at Splice. I even was interviewing artists at one point for the blog, and I&#8217;ve worked with the product team on implementing stuff on the marketplace. So it&#8217;s a wide range of projects. And I think the core thing that&#8217;s interesting that ties it all together is Splice for those who don&#8217;t know is a music technology company. And Splice&#8217;s core offering is a marketplace of samples. So we&#8217;re really a creator-forward and creator-first company, which makes it fun as a creator myself to make work for people who have a creative eye, and have things like taste and know what they think is cool, and what they&#8217;re interested in. And might be working on their own album covers, or music videos, or social media strategies for themselves. So yeah, it&#8217;s been a really interesting journey and I&#8217;m excited to talk more about some of the individual specific pieces.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean it sounds like you were doing a lot outside of Art direction. I mean it sounds like it&#8217;s art direction, it&#8217;s creative strategy, it&#8217;s content strategy. It&#8217;s kind of a lot wrapped up under one title.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Definitely. And I think that&#8217;s part of the startup lifestyle. There&#8217;s always more to be done. And I think that also is tied into our team structure across both the creative organization, but also the content marketing team I&#8217;ve been working with. Where everyone&#8217;s very collaborative and very open to new ideas, which kind of led all of us to flex onto different stuff. So I worked with content strategists who were also making beats and were writers. And I&#8217;ve worked with writers who come up with their own content ideas and whole video franchises and things of that nature. So a lot of things going on, and a small amount of people working on them across the organization. But a really creative team, which is fun always.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me more about the team. What did that look like? You mentioned content strategist doing a lot also.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So the way our team is set up is my creative director, Meg V√°zquez is at the head of the brand organization. And then there&#8217;s kind of a flat structure that sits underneath her. So I am art direction. So that includes all content marketing basically, as well as these larger special projects. We have three designers on the team who all have their own areas of expertise, one of whom focuses on motion graphics and kind of brand design. One of them is a really strong brand owner and ensures that the Splice brand across services from employee merchandise to landing pages all feel consistent. And then there&#8217;s a designer who focuses primarily on growth marketing, and in addition to that we also have a copywriter.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s kind of a core creative team. In addition to that, there are two folks who work primarily on video. And then our sister team is the content marketing team in a lot of ways, where we work really closely with folks who do social media strategy for things like Twitter and TikTok. We have some folks who are really specific into one person runs the blog and is the editor energy for the blog. Someone is really specialized in music education and looking at how we can create different curriculums for people to learn music. I think it&#8217;s about eight or so people on each of those teams. And we support initiatives from across the rest of the organization as many content marketing and creative groups do. So we&#8217;ll take in work from things that we obviously generate on our own in our own editorial initiatives. But we also work with other teams around the company to tell the public and tell Splice users about new features, new pack releases, and just new projects that we&#8217;re working on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the most challenging part about working at Splice?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
This is an interesting question. Because I think there&#8217;s two things that are challenging. One of them is a palindrome almost if you will, of a challenge. But I think the first one is just that it is a startup still, and Splice is still figuring out just where it&#8217;s going to go and what it&#8217;s going to be in the future. And that&#8217;s always something that can be difficult for any organization, especially in the creative side. Because you&#8217;re having to deal with new projects coming up, or things getting deprioritized, or new initiatives getting spun up, and potential for wider company directions to change. So just being really adaptable. That&#8217;s been a challenge that I think I&#8217;ve personally grown from, and I know several people that have also really grown from that as well. But it&#8217;s never easy to have to change what you&#8217;re working on and change your focus with that level of frequency.</p>
<p>And I think the other thing that&#8217;s challenging about Splice but is also I think my favorite part about working at Splice is it&#8217;s a music company first and foremost, and people tend to be very passionate about music. And so naturally, we have a lot of people on staff who are super passionate about music making. Whether they are avid listeners or concept goers, or musicians themselves. And that means you have a lot of buy-in from folks and a lot of personal attachment to the work. And that&#8217;s great, but it can also cause friction at times when people are so personally invested in the work that they&#8217;re doing. So it&#8217;s a challenge, but I think it&#8217;s one that when we can unlock, it and when we can solve it, and when we can really work together in cool ways, it&#8217;s a huge benefit and makes working there really pleasurable. But it&#8217;s kind of a push and pull always there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I have to say, even as you&#8217;re describing it being the startup and then also being something that is really for music lovers and people who love music because it&#8217;s a music company, I would love something like that. I would love to work at a place that&#8217;s passionate about music, but then it&#8217;s also tech oriented, and design oriented. How big is Splice actually? Rough count.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I think somewhere between 200 and 250 if I&#8217;m not mistaken right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, that&#8217;s not too bad. I&#8217;ve mostly worked at startups that have been in that 50 to 60 person range, and that&#8217;s when stuff really starts getting really thorny. Because the old stalwarts that have been there like yourself that have been there for multiple years, and then you&#8217;ve got newer hires that expect a culture that&#8217;s another way. And you&#8217;re trying to do all this together in this kind of fast-paced environment. So for me, it sounds like something I&#8217;d be interested in, but that&#8217;s because I really like music. I was a musician myself for a lot of years. But especially during the past few years we&#8217;ve had, I could see how that could take its toll.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
And I think like I said, it&#8217;s a great problem to have where you have people who are really passionate about the work. But again, I think that that super deep level of passion and emotional investment when tied together with the trappings of a startup and things shifting. And priorities being not in flux all the time, but they do change naturally. I think it can just be a little difficult to make sure that everyone&#8217;s on the same page about where we&#8217;re all going.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s a challenge. But I think if you&#8217;re kind of ready to accept that ambiguity and really be open to flexing and taking on all these different things that you can really learn from and grow from, it&#8217;s an environment that I know I&#8217;ve learned and gained a lot from.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say has been the most rewarding part of working there?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I&#8217;m a real fan of my creative director, Meg V√°zquez. We worked together at GQ as well. And being able to work under her and really see what a good creative director looks like in action has been such a pleasure and an honor. And I think all the lessons I&#8217;ve learned from her and just how to manage a team, and empower people, and solve problems, and ensure creative integrity and all these things are a lot of lessons I know I&#8217;m going to be taking with me for the rest of my career. That&#8217;s been a real pleasure to work with her. And then also it just extends into the rest of the people that I&#8217;ve been able to work with. I think the people at Splice have just been such a pleasure, and we&#8217;ve been able to do some really cool stuff.</p>
<p>One of my close colleagues who&#8217;s a content strategist, his name&#8217;s Ken Herman, he&#8217;s Japanese American. Important context because we were both basically the leads on all social media at the time in 2020. Him being the strategist, me being the designer. And obviously, Splice is a music company. But we are also an American music company, which means that if you&#8217;re reading between the lines, we are a Black music company, whether the staffing reflects that or not. We are a music company that primarily prophets in Black created genres.</p>
<p>So Ken and I were like, &#8220;I think we need to make this a little clearer for everyone here and particular for all of our audience.&#8221; And not that our audience was pushing back on that idea a lot, but we really wanted to make it clear where Splice stood on these issues, and make it clear that we understood the responsibility we had.</p>
<p>So we got to come together and work on a series called As Told By that actually went and became Webby nominated. It was just a small social franchise where we took a specific social issue, whether it was something like the Iran-Contra scandal, or Rockefeller Laws, and went through and found a bunch of textual evidence of all kinds of hip hop artists kind of talking about these issues in their music. And really making an effort to not just&#8230; I think there&#8217;s a misconception for a lot of probably non-Black folks, but Black folks as well around what &#8216;conscious&#8217; rap can be. And folks like Jim Jones talk about the Rockefeller laws. It&#8217;s not just bound by those kind of genre constraints.</p>
<p>So having someone in my team that was super down to work on a project like that, and just do it together, and collaborate on the story, and the design. That kind of working environment I think is a great example of why I love working at Splice and love the people at Splice so much. Just really passionate, really intelligent, and really just down to collaborate and get into the weeds and work really closely together on stuff that they may not know front to back, but are really down to learn and figure it out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That sounds really dope. Actually taking a look at the series now. You covered stuff like the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, the crack epidemic, the Rockefeller drug laws, United States of America versus Billie Holiday, assassination of Fred Hampton, the Iran-Contra affair, the war on drugs. And it&#8217;s all through the lyrics of musicians. Yeah, this is really cool. I have to check this out. This is really cool.</p>
<p>So I want to learn more about your background. I mean, of course we&#8217;re hearing about the creative work, and we&#8217;ll get into what you&#8217;re doing with √Är√≤ko Cooperative and The Imaginary School. But let&#8217;s start with your origin story.</p>
<p>On your website you mentioned that you&#8217;re born in Seattle, but you said you grew up between Portland and Philly, which feels like two wide ends of a spectrum in terms of culture. Portland, Oregon, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah, so I think a lot of my upbringing is a key theme being between different cultures. Because I&#8217;m biracial. My dad, he&#8217;s a white guy from the Pacific Northwest. And my mom grew up in Jamaica until she was about 18.</p>
<p>So they met in the Pacific Northwest and moved to Seattle. So I was born there, lived there for a couple of years. And then we moved to Portland, Oregon and lived a couple of years there. They split up, and then my mom moved to Philadelphia where my grandfather was living with his second wife and a lot of her family. So even over there, that&#8217;s Black Jamaicans, but also Black American side. And then I would spend basically my school time in Philadelphia. And then any vacation time, I would go spend with my dad in Portland. And it&#8217;s two really different places to be sure. Philadelphia, one of the Blackest big cities in America. And Portland, one of the whitest big cities in America.</p>
<p>I just learned a lot. I&#8217;m one of those kids who&#8217;s been drawing my whole life. I&#8217;ve always been interested in art. I think when I first realized that jobs were a thing you had to have, I either wanted to make comic books, or test video games. And I think making comic books or graphic design, not really that different. But those have always been interested of mine.</p>
<p>So I learned a lot from A, being around both really family at the end of the day because my grandmother on my mom&#8217;s side, she&#8217;s a prolific quilter. I&#8217;ve learned a lot about just color and pattern from her. My grandma on my dad&#8217;s side, she is just a broad crafts woman. She loves to do collage, and watercolors, and all this stuff. But neither of them ever did any of this professionally, just purely as hobbies.</p>
<p>And my mom, she&#8217;s a doctor. She&#8217;s an anesthesiologist. And she never really did any of this stuff but has always been really interested in clothing, and home d√©cor, and design. And then my dad is kind of an IT worker. He does all kinds of different IT stuff, but he is also a very passionate DJ. And I think my first kind of real introduction to design was meeting one of my dad&#8217;s friends who was making his mixtape cover art. And he was like, &#8220;Yeah, this is the designer who&#8217;s making my mixtape cover art.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I got introduced to the field really young, but didn&#8217;t really think it was something I would do full-time until much, much later. I spent a lot of time just as any kid does in my age group watching things like Toonami. Part of my upbringing in Portland actually was going to a Japanese magnet school, which is another really key piece of my story. So half the day was taught in English, and half the day was taught in Japanese. And this was right around the big Japan and anime boom of the &#8217;90s. So it was like kids in my second grade class were coming to school with Pokemon cards, and no one had ever seen them before. And the next year, Pokemon, the cartoon went up on WB. And obviously the rest is history.</p>
<p>So Japanese culture and video games, anime, things like that entered into my lexicon really early, and have been a really big source of inspiration since then. So my whole upbringing has just been a real hodgepodge mix of getting introduced to Japanese culture really early, being super interested in mixtape culture, dance hall culture, hip hop culture from a really young age, especially for my dad. And just holding records, and meeting his friends who made flyers, and helping him burn CDs, and things of that nature.</p>
<p>And then I think especially as I went to high school, I really got more into English, and drama, and history, and just writing more so. And I think that whole side of me that&#8217;s more analytical, and research focused, and all about communication merged with my early interests in Japanese culture, and dance hall culture, and all of these things to lead me into at least my adult design career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, that&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
A lot of pieces.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The Japanese magnet school in particular really interests me. I mean one, because you&#8217;re learning about just a different culture. Both language and the Japanese culture. But then to get it at such a young age, especially at the time when in America, Japanese animation was really starting to pop off. Wow, that must have been a wild time as a kid to be a part of that.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
It was really interesting. And the older I get and the more I look back on it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wow.&#8221; It was a public school too. And that&#8217;s a common thing in Portland. There&#8217;s a lot of magnet schools. Looking back on it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Geez, what an insanely foundational and formative experience that was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because I had lots of friends who had older brothers who were into hacking, and modding their PCs, and importing game consoles, and all of these things that I think are super mainstream now. But I didn&#8217;t really understand at the time just how lucky I was to kind of get a front row seat to a lot of this stuff, right as it was coming out because people were going to Japan with their families for the holidays, and bringing stuff back. It was fascinating. It was a very fascinating experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So it sounds like overall growing up you really were exposed to a lot of creative things. And then eventually you went to the University of Pennsylvania, and you studied there as part of their visual studies program. Tell me about that time. What was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So I got to thank my mom for even finding that program in the first place, because I was really kind of torn between how do I do creative stuff and make money. I think the eternal question of any kid whose parents don&#8217;t know what the design industry is. And I didn&#8217;t either at the time. So I was really debating do I do marketing and just do a business program, or do I go to an ad school or advertising school? Or do I go to just a full-on art school and do that? And my mom found this program, which is an amazing program that is basically a hybrid between several different disciplines. Those disciplines being biology, and psychology of sight, and seeing. So how do your rods and cones work? How do images get processed in the brain? These really foundational, biological things are practice.</p>
<p>Our practice, so obviously taking practical art classes like draft design, or painting, or sculpture, things of that nature. And then psychology and philosophy. So really looking at the thinking behind perception, and vision, and the real kind of heady stuff.</p>
<p>And you kind of choose one to focus in. So you take a majority of your classes in a specific area. I focused in fine art practice, specifically design. And then you just get this really interesting and well-rounded experience I think for an academic experience in particular, where you&#8217;re getting to learn a lot of different things that are all tightly related to each other, but are very different formally. I think each person, if you were to just focus on one of those things, that&#8217;s a whole field in and of itself. But we were having a really interesting time learning about the anatomy of your eye, and then having to go into a fine arts class and actually figure out a way to translate that into something visual. Or taking a historical image, and creating a sculpture that reflects the character of the image, as well as communicates the initial meaning.</p>
<p>So it was a really interesting education. And especially as someone who didn&#8217;t take any formal art classes in high school or anything like that, it was pretty wild to be dropped into the real deep end of design, and design theory, and all of these things right as I started school. But it provided me, especially someone with a lot of different interests and someone who is pretty flexible I think, a ton of freedom to just do what I wanted to do and learn about things that I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And I was basically able to do two thesis projects at the end of my time there, just from the fact that I was able to come to the program early. I finished my requirements early. I got a good sense of the things I was interested in, and got to take some graduate classes in my final semester. So it was a really, really great time. Academically. So yeah, very interesting program that I recommend to anyone who&#8217;s really interested in the whole ecosystem of visual image making as a whole entity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now, does Penn still have that program?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
It does, yeah. I believe the head of the program, his name is Ian Verstegen. He was my senior thesis advisor. So shout out to you, Ian.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean that sounds like a really great program. Especially like you said, you have all these different interests. And visual studies may sort of help you find a way to channel that into something.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. And I think the key thing it really taught me was to never make something without thinking about it first. Especially when it comes to design in particular. And always kind of have a thought of what you want something to do or what it needs to accomplish, or the response you wanted to elicit in someone, before you go into actually making the thing. That was a big thing I learned from that program.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you graduated from there in 2015. And one of your first jobs out of college, you were working for GQ Magazine. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So just sung the praises of this program. But it sounds complicated. And two prospective people who wanted to hire, they also I think thought it was complicated, because I could not find a job for a pretty long time. But I was really lucky enough to find this opportunity at GQ Magazine.</p>
<p>So if this was about seven months after I graduated, and I found this opportunity. And it was a web producer job. So it&#8217;s not a design title, not a designer, not a creative anything. It was just kind of a go between for all things within the website. At that time I was still living at home. I was doing some light freelance work, but I was like, &#8220;No, I want to move to New York. I want to get my career started. I&#8217;m going to go and take this job, and I&#8217;m going to go meet the art director first day, and tell them that I want to be a designer, and we&#8217;ll see how it goes from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I was at GQ for three years, three years total. And in that three years, I had four different titles. So I started as web producer, then became a visual designer. Then I was a visual editor. Then I was an art director and manager. And I worked on a bunch of different stuff while I was there. So in my first year, I was hand transcribing stories from old magazines so they could be published on the website. And helping my boss, who was the editor of the website, do her expenses, and keep track of contracts for writers that were doing regular columns and things like that. And I just kind of kept my head down and just kept working on these things, and kept bothering people to give me more stuff to do. So eventually, I started making some small illustrations for e-commerce stories, and then able to do some more big illustrations.</p>
<p>And I think a big moment for me when I was in that first year is I got to make a piece of art for the editor and the chief&#8230; The editor&#8217;s letter? Yeah, the editor&#8217;s letter. And it was about, I think this was in 2016. So it was in the throes of the election and all this stuff.</p>
<p>And it was a piece about Barack Obama, and I just cut together a found image of his bust that I think had maybe been 3D printed by the Smithsonian or something, and Abe Lincoln&#8217;s statue. And that piece went super viral. Definitely the copy was great, but I do think the image had a lot to do with it. And that was kind of a turning point where people really started like, &#8220;This kid knows what he is doing. He knows how to make a brief. He knows how to think through the stuff. We could use him on the design side.&#8221;</p>
<p>So after that, I kind of really started pushing into more of the design world. Eventually they were able to make some space for me over there. And then I spent the latter half of my time at GQ working on Snapchat Discover, which for again, those who don&#8217;t know is, I mean I think it still is active. But it was a bit huge initiative that Snapchat was doing to kind of partner with a lot of legacy publications, and just making moving animated magazines for a younger audience. So I did that for two years, partly as an editor as part of a team. And then I took over the team in my third year.</p>
<p>And in addition to doing a lot of design, illustration, content planning, content strategy, I also got to do a lot of writing at GQ, which is I think pretty unique for a lot of designers. So I had the first interview with Daniel Kaluuya after Out came out with any major publication. And that was a big moment, that was really one I&#8217;m really proud of. And I got to interview a number of musicians like Christian Scott, and [inaudible 00:34:40] and Lil Tracy, and all these people. So it was a really wild ride to be at such a large legacy publication at a time when the money was visibly drying up day by day. So I think it worked for me in the fact that there was not enough staff around, where I was able to just grab stuff and people would just be happy to have someone do it, no matter what their title was. So it really worked out for me in that way. But it was a really interesting time just crashing into that world and having no background in fashion or New York media, and just getting the whole wave washing over me.</p>
<p>But I learned a ton there, met a lot of really interesting people. And really, I think especially going back to my kind of academic background, I taught myself a lot of design stuff even while I was in school. And GQ was the time when I really learned what type design and type setting really meant, and how to really apply that stuff. So I kind of cut my teeth both in the world of multitasking and doing a lot of different stuff at once, but also really getting those hard design skills that I had been lacking in my academic education and self-taught practice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you get a chance to work on any video while you were there?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I did, yeah. I did a number of video projects. I did some design for an Issa Rae video when she was on the Man of the Year issue. And some other stuff with Travis Scott, Kylie Jenner. And I got to do both creating graphics for videos, as well as producing and interviewing people for video too. So I got a whole spectrum of experience in that area.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s some Conde Nast video Style Bible, but all of the videos that I watched out of GQ, Vanity Fair, etc., are so well done. It&#8217;s some of the really good video content. I&#8217;d say even now in this kind of, I don&#8217;t know, short video age when people look at Reels, and TikTok, and stuff like that. GQ is doing some of the best long form, and when I say long form, I&#8217;m thinking, I don&#8217;t know what. 10 minutes or more I guess. But they&#8217;re doing some of the best long form video content out there. It&#8217;s really good stuff.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
And I think actually two of the dudes who I worked with when I was there years ago I think are still there pushing a lot of that stuff forward. So they do some really awesome stuff. And it was a real pleasure to both be able to collaborate with that team, and also just watch them and see how they work. And I think that was something I really just did a lot of at GQ was just watching people, and just seeing how all these people move through the world, and did their work, and how people would just stroll into places they owned it, and were always going to think that they could get access to a certain person or anything. And that was really inspiring to me. I was like, &#8220;Oh wow, I guess I can just go do stuff. If I have GQ in my email, people will just answer my emails back. So I should just try to take advantage of that.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I imagine that helps a lot.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. I still get emails to this day of people asking me to feature their X artist in GQ. But yeah, those days are behind me now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now along with what you just talked about with Splice, with GQ, and everything. You&#8217;re on the leadership teams of two organizations, √Är√≤ko Cooperative and The Imaginary School. Let&#8217;s talk about the √Är√≤ko Cooperative first. Because we&#8217;ve talked about it on the show before. As you mentioned earlier, it used to be known as Design to Divest. And we&#8217;ve had some folks on the show from Design to Divest. We had Michael Collette, we had Azeez, we had Zariah. What was behind the decision to change its name?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m actually super excited to talk about this because Design to Divest was this really impromptu gathering when we really came together initially. [inaudible 00:38:46] who was kind of the seed planter who put up the first Instagram post, even when we all came together for the first time, they were like, &#8220;We could change the name and maybe the logo could look different.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know. I just wanted to get people together. And I think that name and that group made sense for a while. And I think we retained a lot of the folks who kind of joined really early. And that felt good to kind of keep the momentum going.</p>
<p>But especially going into this year as we&#8217;re coming I guess&#8230; Yeah, we&#8217;re over two years old now. We had really started to gel a smaller, specific, dedicated team of folks that was just this core group of eight who had been consistently coming to stuff. The steering committee had had as many as 30 members at certain points.</p>
<p>So after a while and really working together week over week, we kind of gelled down this specific group. And once we kind of landed on that core group, we really started to ask ourselves, what do we actually want to do together? And what do we want to do here? And that led us to thinking about questions of what is the right name? Is Design to Divest, a project within our kind of wider umbrella of things that we like to do? We determined that it was.</p>
<p>So basically where we landed was Design to Divest is the first large scale project completed by √Är√≤ko Cooperative. And √Är√≤ko Cooperative is going to be kind of an umbrella organization for a variety of different initiatives that we&#8217;re going to be doing moving forward. So Design to Divest being one of them. And that sits within our core offerings of things like zines, or merchandise, and publishing. We are also going to be doing some consulting work. So we actually just completed our first client project very recently. So there&#8217;ll be case studies about that probably up on our website by the time this interview is up.</p>
<p>And then we&#8217;re going to be doubling down on a lot of community initiatives. So we&#8217;re going to be doing quarterly events that are for Black designers specifically, that are free. We&#8217;ll probably be doing some more open events for the wider design community that&#8217;ll be paid for. And then we have a Discord server, which is kind of just a little bit more impromptu place for Black designers to congregate.</p>
<p>So we really just took stock of all that stuff and determined let&#8217;s put Design to Divest in its own box that allows all of the work that&#8217;s been done by people who are not active in the group anymore to be really properly archived, and separated, and celebrated. And then gives this new kind of smaller group full license to create what we want this thing to be for ourselves, and really just not be bound by any historical things, or previous projects, or any of that.</p>
<p>And just really go from the ground up, working together to come up with a new name, and new brand, and new direction, and all of that together. So it was really just a chance to celebrate some old work and give ourselves a fresh start looking into the years to come for the rest of the cooperative.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Sounds like it was a massive change than just the name. It really sort of changed a lot with just even the purpose. I mean, not so much the purpose behind why you came together. But how do you keep the group moving forward? What are the new goals and things of that nature? Are there other things that have changed over the years now that you&#8217;ve been doing this?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. I think the biggest honor of my design career so far to build this group with these folks. And we&#8217;ve gone through all kinds of changes, whether it&#8217;s going from using Zoom for our meetings and Slack, to moving to Discord, and using that as a primary surface for all meetings, and events, and planning, and all that stuff. To getting a better sense of what our actual deliverables and our offerings. The offerings we want to actually put out for our clients, and determining that maybe we want to do X thing and this thing, but maybe not this thing even, if we have the capacity and capability to do it.</p>
<p>And I think the biggest change too is we&#8217;ve all gotten paid this year for the first time. That&#8217;s a big change. We&#8217;ve been doing it for free for two years, and we were able to get some clients, and get some funds raised. Everyone was able to get a check this year I think. I&#8217;m excited to see my own tax return from the work that we completed this year.</p>
<p>And I think another big change too has just been getting a lot closer to each other as a group, to where we feel really good about just moving forward on new projects without having to have everyone touching everything at the same time. I think that&#8217;s been a big learning development for us is that we have a really wide set of skills in our core group of now nine. And we can divide and thrive. We don&#8217;t need to have eight people on a certain project. We can just have two people on a project, and they&#8217;re going to run it great. And that means three people over here can go and do something else.</p>
<p>So that process of just figuring out our working norms, and how do we operate as a non-hierarchical design entity, and just really figuring out how we can make this thing sustainable for the long term in a way that feels really good has been a series of ongoing changes for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now let&#8217;s talk about The Imaginary School. The Imaginary School on the website is described as, &#8220;An eye on our present, past, and future.&#8221; Where did the idea to start that come from?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So The Imaginary School I think, at least for me in my own practice. √Är√≤ko is kind of the group activity that I really spent a lot of my time with. And it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re going to be doing consulting and making new projects and all this stuff. And Imaginary School is kind of my personal just personal passion project, which is really about education.</p>
<p>So the actual idea of The Imaginary School started back in college with a couple of my friends who were all a bunch of creative folks as well, and we just kind of came up with the name as an umbrella for any collaborations we were going to do amongst ourselves. And we put out one project, and didn&#8217;t really put out any other formal projects after that. We all continued to stay friends, and we&#8217;ve all worked on different projects and stuff together. But nothing really formalized.</p>
<p>And I really wanted to take that, and revive it, and bring some life back to it in the form of more open collaboration with people all over the world, and different interests, and people that we didn&#8217;t have personal connections to.</p>
<p>So in 2019 actually, I spent a lot of time thinking about what the new iteration of this thing could be. And that was spurned by some conversations I had with another friend who was in grad school and who was continuously being like, &#8220;Hey Shak, you got to read this PDF of Saidiya Hartman,&#8221; who I&#8217;d never heard of at the time. I was like, &#8220;Oh yeah, that&#8217;d be great.&#8221; And then, Hey Shak, you got to check out this great PDF by Fred Moten, and you got to check out this from da, da, da, da.&#8221; And after a while I was like, &#8220;You know Isaac, is there a way we can just share this knowledge more widely? Because there&#8217;s so many of these things that are becoming really foundational to my thinking and design process, and I never would&#8217;ve learned about them had you not shared that PDF with me.&#8221; And we were like, &#8220;Yeah, I think we could figure something out.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we really took the idea of The Imaginary School of that open collaboration, and wanted to figure out a way to just open source it basically and make it accessible to everyone. And also something that other people could replicate.</p>
<p>So right now, it is a two-part kind of operation. We have an arena page, which just houses all kinds of resources from across the internet in fields as disparate as video games, to the environment, to Palestine, to parenting and sexuality and relationships. We just have a ton of different information that&#8217;s just kind of crowdsourced and crowd collected. And then there&#8217;s a Discord server which is attached to it where someone can go and find someone to chat about with if they have questions about a particular topic or they found something really interesting and just are looking for someone to chat to.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s this two-pronged approach. And it&#8217;s pretty chill, for lack of a better word. I don&#8217;t spend a ton of time trying to curate stuff and push for engagement on it. I just really want it to be something that&#8217;s easy for people to get into and use as they please. But that&#8217;s an ongoing project for me. And I&#8217;m always looking for new ways to grow it and activate it. So I&#8217;ll be doing probably more of that into the new year as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I see on the website you have some of these discussions that you mentioned. Does doing The Imaginary School and √Är√≤ko Cooperative, do they share similar goals? Do you see there being some overlap between those two?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Definitely. I think any project that I work on ideally shares some goals. And I think in those two projects, just that idea of having a more open and equitable kind of design world is a big one for me. I mean, the most popular channel of our Imaginary School channels is one that is specifically decentering whiteness in design.</p>
<p>So I think there&#8217;s a lot of overlap in the goals of those two projects. I think √Är√≤ko is a bit doing it a bit more active way, whereas Imaginary School is more passive and just trying to get people information so they can reach conclusions and do their projects on their own. But definitely a lot of overlap in the long-term goals of both of those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In recent years, what would you say the biggest lesson is that you&#8217;ve learned about yourself?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I think the biggest lesson I have learned about myself in recent years is that I do not have the energy that I thought I had, is the biggest one. I think even when I was younger and would work all day, and commute, and then come home and work for five or six hours at night into the wee hours of the morning on freelance projects or side stuff, I think I was kidding myself that I could keep that going for as long as I did.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s really the biggest thing is that for me to do my best work and especially do my best work with other people, I need time to unplug, and de-stress, and just not think about design or any of the large issues that are constantly weighing on my head. I need time to just decompress and really give myself time to recover in between really digging into these projects.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think the older we get, our energy levels in some ways kind of naturally wane. But I definitely get what you mean about that, it&#8217;s more about what you put your energy towards, I think also.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think when you&#8217;re younger, there&#8217;s a lot of stuff that you try to do all the things because you have the time, and the capacity, and the space to do all of that. And then as you get older, you just become just more intentional about what it is that you actually want to put your energy towards, what you want to put your name on. That sort of thing, what you want to be affiliated with. It&#8217;s less about doing all the things, and more about trying to do the right things for you.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yep. I completely agree. And as someone who had a traditional education in a lot of ways but didn&#8217;t have a traditional design education, I spent a lot of my twenties&#8230; I turn 30 next year. I spent a lot of my twenties just saying yes to anything I could get my hands on, because I felt like I needed to prove my skills. And also I wanted to develop my skills. And that got very old after a while, especially when you&#8217;re still dealing with commitments that are maybe multiple years old or something like this from when you were younger and a different person.</p>
<p>So yeah, definitely something as I move on is going to be just probably saying no to almost everything. And really allowing myself to just focus on the things that I think are going to make the most impact for myself and for the world. So √Är√≤ko and Imaginary School are two big ones.</p>
<p>I also would love to have a little time to just do stuff for fun. Again, I think I spent a lot of my last 10 years of my design career doing projects for people and with people and always serving as that creative liaison, or designer, or creative director or whatever. But it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve done something that was just for me. And I&#8217;d love to get back to the ideas I had when I was a kid of making a comic book. So hopefully that&#8217;s the next actual personal project I do I complete in some indeterminable amount of time, maybe in the next five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me about the comic book. Because that&#8217;s an idea that I&#8217;ve had for a very long time. I&#8217;ve always wanted to do some type of a comic book, or a graphic novel, or something. I&#8217;ve sort of done print design at different times throughout my career. But I&#8217;d say roughly within the past year and a half or so, I actually started working with printers. Because I was working at a company, and we made a print magazine. So I got to really see behind the scenes with paper types and all that stuff.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s a lot less expensive than I thought it was. I think at the time that I was doing it also, there was just this massive paper shortage. Because I would think with masks and with just all the other stuff happening with the pandemic and things like that, everything was in a shortage. There were supply chain issues and stuff. But it&#8217;s actually a lot cheaper to print say 100 copies of a comic book if you just want to test it out. Lot cheaper than you think, or a lot cheaper than I thought at least. I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not a lot of money at all. I could do that.&#8221; I just now need to write it, maybe find somebody to draw it color, and get all that sort of stuff</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I mentioned earlier I&#8217;m hugely influenced by video games, manga, anime, all that stuff. So this also ties into my last thing about taking more time and rest and all that. I&#8217;ve just been trying to a lot more time just playing video games and reading comic books over the last couple years. Because basically in the end of 2019, I was just so burned out and just had totally ran myself dry. And I realized, &#8220;When was the last time I just played a video game for two hours?&#8221; And it had been basically since my senior year of college. So I was like, &#8220;All right, let me take some more time to do these fun things.&#8221; And so I&#8217;ve been reading a lot more comic books and all that.</p>
<p>And the idea I have, and I&#8217;m happy to share this with you right now, is basically make it a traditional kind of battle anime style, where everyone has a superpower, and they fight a big villain, and there&#8217;s big fight scenes and all that stuff. But have it all be based around a community organization that helps their local community by day, and fights the US government&#8217;s secret agents by night. And all of that happens in their dreams. So it&#8217;s all kind of about astral projection. I think it allows for a lot of fun ideas to roam free. With the core idea of this is a group that&#8217;s been fighting the government for years, and this government agency has been suppressing social unrest in people&#8217;s dreams for hundreds of years or something like that. So that&#8217;s the loose idea that I&#8217;m working with, and I really do want to put it to paper sometime soon, because I think it&#8217;s certainly something I would be really happy to read at the very least.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I like that. I like that a lot. That&#8217;s a really good idea. Who are some of the mentors, or colleagues, or people that have helped you get to this point in your career?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
I think there&#8217;s one person in particular who is absolutely the most influential. And I mentioned her already, but Meg V√°zquez. She&#8217;s just been so huge for me, I think, and really getting that serious design education. So she&#8217;s my boss at GQ. So we worked together at GQ for two years. We&#8217;ve worked together at Splice for almost four years. And Meg was a part of the Hillary for America design team. So she cut her teeth on all that stuff. And she&#8217;s just been a huge figure for me in just in terms of just getting to know design better, and knowing how to operate, and how to just do design in a professional setting. So really, really could not have done it without her.</p>
<p>And then in addition to her, Charles Hall is another one who&#8217;s really important for me in terms of my creative growth and expression. And he was a TA of mine at Penn in the graduate seminar I mentioned early in our interview. And he&#8217;s an amazing designer, creative director in his own write. He wrote Michael Jordan&#8217;s retirement letter, and just has an amazing way with words and communication. And we&#8217;ve worked on a couple projects together. And he&#8217;s taught me a ton about the industry, and really pushed me as a designer to I think embrace my experiences a lot, and really lean on the things that I know better than other people. So those folks are super crucial.</p>
<p>But I also have to give a really big shout out to just my whole √Är√≤ko Cooperative team. I&#8217;ve learned so much from working with those people. And it&#8217;s hard to put into words I think the amount of knowledge we&#8217;ve been able to build just amongst ourselves in the last couple years. And I think I&#8217;ve learned as much from that group in two and a half years than I have in my four years of Ivy League education. So those folks are all really foundational for me, and I could not have gotten to where I am or done any of this stuff where I&#8217;m at now without the help of the Meg, Charles, and my √Är√≤ko squad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you want to change in 2023?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
In 2023, I want to just be really deliberate and intentional with how I&#8217;m spending my time. I want to be spending my time when I have to be working and making money, doing something that is directly making people&#8217;s lives better. So I&#8217;m excited about joining this mental health company to do that.</p>
<p>And then also in my time out of the office, I want to make sure that anytime I&#8217;m spending doing additional work, it&#8217;s stuff that&#8217;s really important to me and really is serving me in the world. And then just having plenty of time to just relax. So really just making sure that I&#8217;m not spreading myself too thin. In fact, doing the opposite and giving myself a lot of time to just learn, and read, and mess with this comic book, and just chill out a little bit. I think I&#8217;ve earned it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to still be doing? What kind of new work do you want to do? Anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. I think in the next five years, I would ideally be working full-time for myself or in collaboration with some of the folks I&#8217;ve mentioned before. I&#8217;m really excited about this new gig, and I have no idea where that&#8217;s going to take me. But I really have the long term goal of being able to run my my own studio, either by myself or in collaboration with other folks. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m really hoping for is getting the chance to just do that, and have a lot more freedom to go and just build the things that I think the world needs to have out in the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work and everything, your projects you mentioned? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Yeah. So the best place to find me is just at my website. It&#8217;s shakeil.com. S-H-A-K-E-I-L.com. You&#8217;re going to find everything there. I&#8217;m really active on Arena, so if you&#8217;re looking for a little bit more of a social atmosphere, you can find me at Arena/shakeilgreeley. And then for √Är√≤ko, you can find us at aroko.coop. So A-R-O-K-O.coop. And that&#8217;s a great place to go and get a full sense of what we&#8217;re working on. We have a really large project, which is our design manifesto that&#8217;ll be coming out probably by the time this interview airs. So definitely go check that out. You&#8217;re going to get some really interesting stuff, I&#8217;ll tell you that much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well Shakeil Greeley, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I feel like this interview was a great way to kind of close out the year. One, I think just to hear about the great things that you&#8217;re doing around something that we&#8217;ve mentioned on the show over the past two years, which is Design to Divest, that&#8217;s now the √Är√≤ko Cooperative. But seeing how you are working with something like that and then taking that to move forward into a bigger, grander future, I think that&#8217;s something that we all of course want to see, but something that we all need as well. And I&#8217;m just glad you were able to come on the show, and share your story. And I&#8217;m really excited to see what you do next. So thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Shakeil Greeley:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me, Maurice. It&#8217;s been such a pleasure and a real honor to be on the show. It&#8217;s an amazing way for me to close my ear up.</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Hi, my name is Lauren Brown, and I&#8217;m currently an illustrator and art director working at Wizards of the Coast.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has this year been going for you?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been a very interesting year, because it&#8217;s been a year of a lot of change. I think that I have probably had the most tumultuous year that I&#8217;ve had. No, I guess I can&#8217;t really say most tumultuous because the pandemic did just happen. But this year, it&#8217;s very tricky because I just moved back to Atlanta from Austin, Texas, and lost a job that I really believed in the day before I moved down. And then got another dream job. So it&#8217;s been a big year of ups, and downs, and a lot of a big journey, so to speak. But it&#8217;s also been a really good year because I&#8217;ve learned a ton and I&#8217;ve been able to do a lot. So it&#8217;s been a roller coaster a bit, but in a good way</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like it. I think this has been a kind of rebuilding year for a lot of folks, especially I don&#8217;t want to say coming out of the pandemic, but certainly as we are now more normalized to just the way the world is now. People are starting to get back into some sort of a familiar rhythm. So it sounds like that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve been trying to do also.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been trying to do. But I&#8217;ve been disrupted from really reestablishing myself. Because during the pandemic, I&#8217;ve really been in my head a lot doing a lot of internal work and doing a lot of self-centering and growing. I also got diagnosed with ADHD in 2021, so it was also a lot of coping and coming to terms with that. And working from home and having that pandemic environment exacerbated that. But from that, I learned a lot about how to master myself and learning how to be in better control of my own inclinations and my own tendencies.</p>
<p>And so I&#8217;ve been growing a lot over that course of the pandemic. Because weirdly, 2020 was a good year for me. Even though obviously stress wise and world wise it was awful. But because I&#8217;m an introvert and because I was able to be internal, I was able to do a lot of work towards my personal growth and my career that I think I may not have been able to do if not for that crazy, awful year. And a lot of it was the product of a lot of horrible things like the protests and all that. But that&#8217;s when people started to really take notice of Black creators and really wanted to elevate them. And so therefore, I had a good year because of that, even though it&#8217;s like a double-edged sword, obviously. Yeah, it&#8217;s weird to say always.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I&#8217;ve heard that from people too with the events that happened during the summer with folks protesting and with companies trying to I guess come to some level of recognition of what people of color, particularly what Black people are going through in both professional and personal capacities. I know a lot of people got an influx of work, so I completely understand that.</p>
<p>Now you sort of alluded to this. You have a really long history as an art director and an illustrator. But I want to start with where you&#8217;re at now. You mentioned you&#8217;re at Wizards of the Coast. Can you tell me a little bit about the work you&#8217;re doing there?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Yes. I just started at Wizards of the Coast in October, late October. So I am the art director on Magic: The Gathering on the marketing side of things. So that means that I get to work on trailers and online content, and art direction with commissioning artists as well for key art. It&#8217;s a really exciting opportunity because it&#8217;s a chance to work with amazing artists all across the industry, and also impact the fantastic trailers that Magic does. And I&#8217;ve also been a huge Wizards fan for probably about over 12 years now. I started playing Match at the Gathering with my best friend, and then I started playing D&#038;D eight years ago while working at Floyd County Productions, which I&#8217;ll talk about later.</p>
<p>But both of those games have really changed my life in terms of just making more friends, being more social, and just giving a very enriching, inspiring experience. So it feels really good to be able to work at a company that has directly influenced my life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. How is the work going so far?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Right now I&#8217;m just onboarding. So I think you&#8217;ll probably hear a lot of people say this. When you first start at a studio, you have to learn how the systems work and you have to learn how the communication styles are. All of the acronyms, all the people that you&#8217;re going to be working with. So I haven&#8217;t really gotten to dive deep into things yet just because I&#8217;ve been doing onboarding for the past few weeks. But I&#8217;m really excited to see the work that I&#8217;m going to eventually start on and which project I&#8217;m really going to be able to impact. Obviously, whatever project I work on won&#8217;t come out for a little bit. But I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing that first trailer that comes out that I&#8217;ve gotten to have a hand in, and see people react to it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, of course people know of Magic: The Gathering as a card game. Of course it&#8217;s expanded to more than that. But is it different doing art direction for a card game versus say like a video game?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Absolutely. Because when you&#8217;re working on a game that already has mechanics and already has such a big following, and also for the fact that it&#8217;s a physical card game, there are a lot more considerations of various different teams that you have to collaborate with and communicate with when you&#8217;re doing video games. Because you&#8217;re handling technology, and you&#8217;re handling a player experience and how the player is going to engage with the art in a completely different context.</p>
<p>Obviously there&#8217;s similar considerations. It&#8217;s very parallel to a card game, because you have to still consider how the player is going to look at the card, how they&#8217;re going to interact with it. How they&#8217;re going to feel when they experience it and what the story they get out of it is. But in a video game, that story is much more immersive. So you really have to think about a video game on a moment to moment basis, and how the player is going to interact with these different objects throughout space, rather than just a physical card that you hold in your hand. But with a card game, you have to figure out how to think about the whole set as a cohesive unit, and as a whole story. So it&#8217;s a different way to think about stories and a different way to think about how the art is going to impact that experience.</p>
<p>But I think from my purview being on the marketing side of things, most of that figuring out is already done. And I have to figure out how the audiences are going to engage with it once it&#8217;s out into the world. It&#8217;s a completely different sphere I think, of art direction than video game art direction is. So the differences are pretty glaring, but I really enjoyed both so far. I enjoy seeing how players interact with the content that we create, and I get to see that one in both aspects. And that&#8217;s really rewarding for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So it sounds like some of that art direction also includes I guess some play testing also, right?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Absolutely. On the wizard side, I won&#8217;t be play testing anything because again, I&#8217;m not working on the core game. However, in video games, there&#8217;s a lot of play testing that needs to be done to make sure that everything that we are creating is coming across as intended for the players. There&#8217;s a whole team dedicated to play testing. They&#8217;re the QA team, quality assurance. And they&#8217;re the ones who really make sure that they&#8217;re catching all the bugs and catching all the errors that we might have, or anything that shouldn&#8217;t be as intended. But the team is also required to play test the games to make sure that everything that we have created is coming across as intended.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my job to make sure that the art is reading as it should be, that nothing is going to be difficult to understand from first read. Is the main character blending into the background? Are these elements standing out? Will the player understand that they have to go through the store? Is that door bright enough or apparent enough?</p>
<p>Things like that are things that video game art directors have to think about, as well as just generally managing the team and making sure that everybody has a clear vision to aim towards. It&#8217;s a really collaborative experience with your full team, because you&#8217;re talking to everybody who&#8217;s making that game. Engineers, designers, producers, tech artists. You have to make sure that all the pieces are coming together. Because again, it&#8217;s a massive collaboration. And you want to make sure that everybody understands what everybody else is doing, so that everything is going to come together as a whole. Cause that&#8217;s very, very important. There&#8217;s a lot of things that can go wrong in video game development.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds a lot like, and maybe this is maybe an abstraction, but it kind of sounds a lot like production work in that you&#8217;re really kind of herding a lot of cats almost.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Absolutely. And usually, you want to be able to trust your team to make sure that they know what they&#8217;re doing. And hopefully you have hired them because they have skills in these areas. Obviously there&#8217;s going to be more junior artists or more junior people who need training and need to learn more. But everybody has something to bring to the table in game development. There shouldn&#8217;t be anybody who is sitting idle and not able to contribute to a certain part of the project. And so really, you have to trust that your team can do what they&#8217;re setting out to do.</p>
<p>But I really enjoy being more of a guide as an art director rather than a straightforward manager. I like to be a mentor, and really sit with my artists and work with them on growing their skills. And making sure that they&#8217;re excited about what we&#8217;re working on, and make sure that they have buy-in about what we&#8217;re working on. So a lot of the decisions that can be made are made without the input of everybody who&#8217;s working on the team, and you can feel like you lose your agency. And so as an art director, I like to make sure that everybody knows what&#8217;s going on. Even if they can say something and maybe it doesn&#8217;t work for the game, but at least they have the chance to speak and be able to contribute to that.</p>
<p>But I really enjoy that collaboration because it teaches me a lot. Especially working with different teams like engineers and design, because they all have different perspectives of what to bring to a game. And I&#8217;m a longtime gamer. And so being able to contribute actively to the process of making a game is really rewarding because you get to see why all these decisions are made. When I see players complaining about a certain aspect of other games that I am a fan of, I just have to shake my head because I generally know why those decisions were made, and why they had to be the way they were. A lot of the requests are things that are completely unreasonable. So being a part of that process is really illuminating, and was eyeopening for me when I first joined the game industry back in 2016.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you kind of have to think about the whole experience. You&#8217;re thinking about it from the player&#8217;s end, you&#8217;re thinking about it of course from your end as the art director. And you&#8217;re really taking all of these considerations into account at every step of the process.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Absolutely. Because again, there&#8217;s a lot of moving parts to a video game. So when you&#8217;re art directing, you can&#8217;t just say, &#8220;I just want it this way, and that&#8217;s it.&#8221; It&#8217;s like no, you have to really consider how that art is going to follow the game play, how it&#8217;s going to follow the story. How it&#8217;s going to work with whatever the engineers can actually code into the game. There&#8217;s a lot of art that you can create that&#8217;s not going to be feasible to fit into the game engine even, or be able to run on certain devices. Because I worked in mobile when I first started my career in gaming, and there&#8217;s a lot of considerations that you have to take for what a phone can handle versus what a console can handle. So you really have to be careful as an artist to not overload the engine so that people can actually play the game.</p>
<p>But you also have to make sure that if you&#8217;re working under a license product, does the art look like the license product? Because the licenser will tell you if it doesn&#8217;t. And you have to be very careful about that. You have to be very careful about trying to put your own point of view in where a specific style has already been established. Because a lot of artists can have the tendency to do that, especially when they&#8217;re more junior.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of considerations to take in art direction. But ultimately, it&#8217;s a lot more technical than working in a field, like say animation would be. And so you have to learn a lot more about what engine requirements there are if you&#8217;re working in Unity or Unreal, what implementation looks like. There is so much to consider. But it&#8217;s been a really fun experience and I&#8217;m already starting to miss it a little bit working on video games proper, even though I haven&#8217;t really gotten to dive deep into my side of things yet at Wizards. But I&#8217;m looking forward to that too. But I think I&#8217;ll always want to make video games.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now will you have an opportunity to also contribute artwork as well?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
I think I might be able to contribute artwork, actually. I don&#8217;t want to say too much, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that I will have an opportunity to be able to do that. Which I&#8217;m really excited about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you mentioned having to consider all of these different parts. And it actually is reminding me of the last job that I had. I was working for a tech startup, but one of the projects they had was that they wanted to make a print magazine.</p>
<p>And I had never made a print magazine before, but I was like, &#8220;I could do this. I&#8217;ve done enough kind of creative-ish projects to get a sense of what this is.&#8221; And I&#8217;m not saying that making a magazine is like making a video game, but I think very much the overall sort of creative direction of putting something together from start to finish, so it can be a singular experience is kind of the same.</p>
<p>With the magazine, I was considering not just the articles that we were publishing, but what&#8217;s the order? What&#8217;s the journey that I want the reader to take from cover to cover? What do we want to have for illustrations? Do we want to have these full page illustrations that mirror the article? Do we want to have maybe a center spread or something like that? So all these considerations, not to mention the size of the magazine, the paper, all of that coming into the experience.</p>
<p>I really think a lot of people do not understand just how much goes into art direction and creative direction in terms of crafting an experience. Cause because just get it at the end and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;This is it. They don&#8217;t consider everything that has to have been done to get to that point.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
And because that process again, is so involved and collaborative. Like I said, there&#8217;s so many things that can go wrong. And people don&#8217;t understand the sheer amount of content that they will never see, because there&#8217;s so much that I&#8217;ve worked on animation and in gaming that has never seen the light of day, because there&#8217;s so many things during the process that can just mess up the works. And the machinery will fail in terms of just the process of what it takes to make a game. And then that project will never get picked up again.</p>
<p>And so the fact that anything is out is a miracle to me, because I&#8217;m pretty sure that people see about probably 1% of all the content that actually has been made behind the scenes. There&#8217;s just really so much. But being able to see it start to finish becomes all that more rewarding, because it&#8217;s so hard to create.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s smaller snippets that you can make too. Anybody can make a game. And sometimes what we would do when I was working at EA and Zynga is that we would do game jams, which you would break up into smaller teams over a very limited course of days. I think the shortest game jams I&#8217;ve worked on was actually one day, but usually it&#8217;s about two or three.</p>
<p>And just five of us who would work together for a few years would come together and make a video game that was playable. It was a requirement that it was a playable game. And I think those experiences out of everything was the most rewarding to me because it was a really focused vision, and it had to be from the beginning because we had so little time to make it. And I was so proud of those little projects, because it was that full collaboration that happened in such a condensed amount of time. And so you really got to see the process from start to finish within that course. And you got to concept it together. You got to brainstorm. You got to come up with our style, and what that&#8217;s going to look like, and how the game is going to play and be coded, and what the experience is going to be like, what the core loop is. And you come up with all that in such a short space.</p>
<p>And then coming out of probably not sleeping for a little bit or staying at work late, and then you get to see people experience your game that quickly is so rewarding and so special. Because you get to see it and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Wow, we had a nugget of an idea and we really made it happen. It actually came to life.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s usually how I feel at the end of any big project, not just with gaming, but in animation, and illustration, and personal projects. I always feel that sense of accomplishment in a sense of, &#8220;Yeah, we made something. We had an idea and it happened.&#8221; Because again, people have no idea how often it just doesn&#8217;t happen or it just ends up as a work in progress. So it&#8217;s really special to be able to play any game. So I want people to appreciate that experience a little bit more because it&#8217;s so hard to make one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that the most difficult part? The fact that you could do all this work and then it just not even be released or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
It&#8217;s not the most difficult because it&#8217;s not up to me whether or not a game is released. But it is the most heartbreaking experience when something that you&#8217;ve worked on really hard or worked really hard doesn&#8217;t see the light of day. This happened in animation as well. There&#8217;s been several projects where I&#8217;ve worked on that I never got to really show anybody. And that was really sad because a lot of us believed in those projects. Same with gaming too. I&#8217;ve worked on at least I think three different games that never got made. And so it was a really heartbreaking experience. But we could also see the writing on the wall very often where we&#8217;re like, &#8220;We don&#8217;t know if those things are going to get made because there&#8217;s too many miscommunications and things that are not really working that we thought was going to work.&#8221; And after a while, there&#8217;s money that&#8217;s spent on these things. And so you have to consider how much the company is willing to invest in this idea that may not pan out, that may not be profitable. And again, it&#8217;s not up to us. It&#8217;s up to the company ultimately.</p>
<p>So I think that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s special to be able to make a game jam because that one is up to the team who&#8217;s making it. And so the fact that the team can come together and agree that this is going to be good enough to create is something that&#8217;s very special.<br>
I think the hardest parts of game development is honestly the starting of it. The pre-production. Because it&#8217;s funny because it&#8217;s also the most fun. Most of the games that I&#8217;ve worked on have actually been live service mobile games. The Simpsons Tapped Out, Harry Potter: Puzzles &#038; Spells, and Words with Friends. And those games had already had a preset cadence with which they were releasing, which is very fun and comforting because you kind of generally know what the player&#8217;s going to expect and you can add new things to it. But the process has been already established.</p>
<p>But when a game is just starting, you have to establish the full process, how the production is going to run, what engine you&#8217;re going to use, what art style you&#8217;re going to use, which is really hard. What the game design is going to be, which is also very hard, and how the code base is going to be set up.</p>
<p>And so building the game initially is difficult because you need to make sure that you can maintain that game, or whatever you&#8217;ve committed to in the beginning can be scalable. Because if it&#8217;s not scalable and you&#8217;re trying to add more things to it, things are going to break really quickly. And it&#8217;s going to be really difficult to update, and edit your game, and add more things to it, and have it be playable on all these different engines. So there&#8217;s so much that has to go into when you&#8217;re first starting the game in pre-production or I guess in prototyping, because you&#8217;re throwing a bunch of stuff at a wall and you&#8217;re just hoping things stick. A game jam condenses this because you don&#8217;t have enough time to consider and mull over the details, and you don&#8217;t have the time to noodle over whatever could be. You just have to decide on something and make it happen.</p>
<p>But when you&#8217;re working on a full game, I mean it&#8217;s your playground, but it&#8217;s also difficult that it&#8217;s your playground. Again, that brainstorming collaboration comes into key. Because people can have buy-in, but they also can say, &#8220;Well that&#8217;s cool, but what if this?&#8221; [inaudible 00:22:24] last forever and ever. And you could end up not making anything because you&#8217;ve done what if this too many times.</p>
<p>So getting people to agree on a vision is really, really difficult. Especially when you have time to disagree. And so that&#8217;s really I think the hardest part for me. But it&#8217;s the most fun because you get to be the most creative. And if all the roles are correct and if people have their wheelhouses that they&#8217;re entrusted to, that can go really smoothly. I&#8217;ve had it go really not smoothly too. So it just really depends on what kind of team you&#8217;re working with and how much everybody trusts each other. It&#8217;s really an exercise in trust I think as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I 100% agree with that. Just to go back to the example I talked about earlier with the magazine, the company sort of had an idea like, &#8220;We want to start a magazine.&#8221; But they didn&#8217;t know what they wanted to call it, what they wanted it to look like. They&#8217;re just like, &#8220;We want to start a magazine and we want to publish it in four months.&#8221; It&#8217;s like okay, so I&#8217;m building it from the ground up, like Khadijah on living single. I&#8217;m trying to build flavor.</p>
<p>And even the initial ideas we had for, it kept changing in that pre-production process to the point where it took us longer to eventually get the first issue out because there were like, &#8220;Well, we want the cover to be this, and we want to do this.&#8221;</p>
<p>And all this sort of stuff. And even getting the internal buy-in from people to write for the magazine, because initially they&#8217;re like, &#8220;We want community members to write.&#8221; And then they switched it and said, &#8220;We want employees to write.&#8221; And employees were like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not in my job description to write articles.&#8221; And it during the holidays and someone would write an article and then say, &#8220;I&#8217;m taking the rest of the month off for Christmas.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What? I need my edits. Where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
But I think that&#8217;s the whole thing too with understanding what your roles are supposed to be on the project. It was something I had mentioned because when that happens, when people were like, &#8220;But you can do this, right?&#8221; That&#8217;s when things can really start to get a little bit&#8230; Again, depends on the team that you&#8217;re working with. But if people were like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not in my job description. Why am I doing this?&#8221; Then it&#8217;s going to be really hard to make something that&#8217;s cohesive because all the lines are blurred. If you are not expecting that to already be the process. If you are to come into a studio with the idea that you&#8217;re going to probably wear a lot of hats, that&#8217;s probably fine. You&#8217;re more of a generalist. But if you&#8217;re not inclined to doing various different things, that&#8217;s going to be really difficult to get adjusted to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yes. Oh yes. And even most of the team that we had for the first issue, we kind of changed it up for the second issue. And I felt like okay, we&#8217;re getting on a really good rhythm with this. I&#8217;m excited about the third issue. We were in production getting it ready. And then they laid off the entire team and it&#8217;s like&#8230;</p>
<p>So to that point about working really hard on something, I was working hard on the third issue of the magazine and they laid us off. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, is the third issue even going to happen?&#8221; And the company&#8217;s like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; So disheartening would that happens. They claim that they&#8217;re going to release it maybe by the time that this interview goes out. They said that they&#8217;ll release it in December. I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re going to do that.</p>
<p>But also this has happened, and I don&#8217;t know if you maybe feel like this too, but sometimes you just have to take the L. I&#8217;m just sort of like, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s above me. I can&#8217;t do anything about it. Oh well.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
No, I have a lot of experience in that. Because a lot of those decisions that were made, we don&#8217;t have any control over as a development team. So we had to take the L a lot and not by choice.</p>
<p>I think an essential part of the creative process though sometimes is learning how to take that L. Because you can hammer it away at something and sometimes it&#8217;s really not meant to work. And I think the difference between if it&#8217;s meant to work or if it&#8217;s not meant to work is the amount of effort that you&#8217;re willing to put into it and the amount of effort that you have the budget to put into it, if the project is dependent on budget. But I think anything can be made. It&#8217;s just if it actually gets finished or not. But any art is not finished. You just say, &#8220;I&#8217;m done.&#8221; There&#8217;s no such thing as finished. You can work on anything for an infinite amount of time. But when you say, &#8220;I&#8217;m done,&#8221; that&#8217;s when the project is finished.</p>
<p>And so it&#8217;s just like people have to learn when walk away from something, and sometimes the effort is futile, and you have to accept that, and move on to something that is better. Because what you do is you take that learning that you got from that last project and you apply to something that could work.</p>
<p>And so taking the L is not always a bad thing, but it is a heartbreaking place you consider all the time that you put into it, and you consider that somebody could have seen this and enjoyed it. But ultimately, you take that experience to go to the next thing and hopefully that next thing can get made. Sometimes it never gets made and that&#8217;s really frustrating too, but it&#8217;s all a part of the process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true. Very true. Let&#8217;s kind of switch gears here a little bit and learn more about you. I know that you&#8217;re here in Atlanta, but did you grow up here?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
No, I actually grew up in New Jersey. I was from a little town in South Jersey called Willingboro, New Jersey, where there was not really much going for it in terms of culture, or art, or anything. Yeah, that&#8217;s where I grew up. It was essentially right outside of Philadelphia where most of my family is. But yeah, my hometown is in Willingboro, New Jersey.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Were you exposed to a lot of design and artwork as a kid?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Actually, yes. So my dad used to be a fashion designer. He&#8217;s always been an electrical engineer for 35 years, but on the side he did fashion design. And I would sit with him as he was picking out his ties, and I would help color coordinate his ties because he was colorblind, which is pretty funny. And I was always really good with color.</p>
<p>But he also designed a lot of dresses, and he did fashion shows for people around the neighborhood and in Philadelphia. And I think that&#8217;s essentially how my mom and dad had met was because he used to be in that fashion industry in Philly. And so I would help him design some of his outfits too. And really getting to see him doing that process of drawing something, and then creating it, and bringing it to life was really inspiring for me.</p>
<p>But I had the inclination to draw ever since I could hold a pencil really. I was unstoppable. I&#8217;d draw on everything. The walls, on homework, just anything I could get my hands on. Because I had a very, very creative imagination. And I always had stories in my head, and I just desperately wanted to get them out. And watching cartoons, anime, Sailor Moon, Pokemon, all these ways that stories could come out was super inspiring for me. And I just wanted to make my own things that made me feel the way that those things make me feel. But my creativity was highly encouraged at home because my dad was creative. And my mom understood what it was like to be creative, even though she wasn&#8217;t a creative. My parents kind of made an effort to make sure that my talent was cultivated, and they enrolled me in art classes, and made sure that I wasn&#8217;t really tamped down.</p>
<p>Because I was a weird child. I was real weird. I grew up in a predominantly Black neighborhood, and I was very, very different than everybody else. And no one really understood me. Which was fine by me because I found my little corners to draw on. And I found a best friend when I was seven years old, who was also really creative. And so me and her would just spend all our time together just making crazy stories and characters, and bringing a lot of our stuff to life. So it was a very inspiring kind of childhood even though it wasn&#8217;t a very inspiring town or culture to grow up around, just because no one really understood what we were doing. But we forged on forward regardless of that fact. So that was really cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now eventually, you ended up going to college and studying illustration and animation first at Montclair State University. And then from there, you went to Savannah College of Art and Design. What was your time like at those schools?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Oh man, it was unlike anything I had ever experienced before. Because when I went to high school, it was a vocational school where they had career majors. And I was in the advertising, art, and design career major. So I really got to work with other artists then and start to dive into what it was like to kind of work as a professional, do a graphic design and doing illustration.</p>
<p>But at Montclair, I feel like that&#8217;s where I really started to understand myself as a person. Because for the first time, really for the first time, people started to accept my weirdness for what it was. Just this creative, artistic child. I guess not child anymore, but this person who just wanted to express themselves. And I was surrounded by all these people who really wanted to express themselves, and was fully accepted for that. Not just accepted, but appreciated for that. And I made some really amazing lifelong friends at Montclair. And I actually went to Montclair with my best friend, that same friend who I met when I was seven.</p>
<p>I really got to explore a lot of different areas in art, sculpture, and ceramics, and painting. I didn&#8217;t do photography, but a little bit of photography and graphic design. And got to see what all these different areas in art had to offer and be very tactile with art. Because I was doing digital for a lot of the time in high school. And so that was a really great learning experience.</p>
<p>But the problem was, is that I was really interested in animation. The aforementioned shows that I used to love to watch. I thought I always thought I was going to be an animator in some regard, but Montclair didn&#8217;t really have an animation program flushed out yet because they just started their animation curriculum. And so when I went there, I was hoping that I could learn about animation and that was kind of opposite from the case. So I ended up rerouting my course and going full into illustration instead.</p>
<p>And so when I was a senior in college, SCAD, Savannah College of Art Design had come to North Jersey to do a kind of seminar about what the school entailed, and they gave me a brochure. And when I read that brochure, I saw that they had all these different majors like sequential art, which was comic books and illustration. And animation and game design. And they were like, &#8220;As a part of our sequential art program, you get to go to Japan for two weeks and you get to learn about the studios that are in Japan.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Well, this is everything I wanted to do in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I remember that there was a London trip that I could have gone to that I chose not to because I wanted to work on my portfolio to apply and get into SCAD. And so I spent those full two weeks just heads down and making art for that because I really, really wanted to get in. And so after I graduated that next year, I applied for SCAD and got into their grad program for illustration. And that was a really crazy experience as well. Yeah, I really wanted to go for that because I think that even though Montclair gave me so much in terms of personal growth, I really wanted that professional side of things too, because I was starting to get more focused in terms of what I wanted to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I would imagine it was probably just a different city environment too. Montclair State University of New Jersey is going to be a lot different than Savannah College of Art and Design. You went to the Atlanta campus, right?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
No, I actually went to Savannah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, you went to Savannah campus. Okay. So I would imagine even just the creative community around you was different because it inspired you in different ways.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
So Montclair was interesting, because everybody was really talented there. But I felt like I was very on par with the high ceiling of talent. I was like, &#8220;Okay, I can run with most of these people. This feels good.&#8221; There was some people who were above and beyond for sure. But I still felt like a fairly big fish in a medium pond. I know it sounds cocky to say, but that&#8217;s really how it was. And I think a lot of us felt that way. When I went to SCAD, I was a really little fish in a really big pond, and was surrounded by incredible talent. And all of my friends were just rock stars, and people who could make some amazing things like crazy illustrators. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think SCAD told you anything because you were naturally this gifted. There&#8217;s no way anybody could have given you this. You&#8217;re amazing.&#8221; And animators who I was like, &#8220;They&#8217;re destined to work at Disney and Pixar. They&#8217;re just crazy good.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so the fact that I was suddenly surrounded by a high ceiling of talent, a space high ceiling of talent. It was both really inspiring and really intimidating. I actually kind of went through a little bit of an artistic crisis when I went to SCAD because I started to try to make work that was everybody else that was in the illustration curriculum. And I didn&#8217;t really have a well-developed personal voice when I was at SCAD because I kind of rerouted myself to try to fit into the mold, fit into what I thought people had expected of me.</p>
<p>But when I went over to animation, my first year, I was solely really in the illustration department and really just learned from all my peers there and my friends there. But two of my really good friend, my best friends came to SCAD the year after I joined scad. And so they were animation majors and I hung out in a mission building a lot more. Which the ammunition building is a renovated coffin factory with no windows, which is really funny. It&#8217;s also open 24 hours, sorry SCAD Savannah.</p>
<p>But it was an environment where we all were really heads down and worked really hard on our projects. And it was the first time that I really got to experience collaboration at school as well, because illustration is a very independently focused type of field.<br>
Animation relies on a team. And not every student opted to do this, but some students built teams of up to 60 people that were full scale productions. They had actual producers. They had storyboard artists, and layout artists, and background artists, animators, compositors, 3D modelers. They had everything. And they ran it just like you would when you were in the industry, which I would find out later.</p>
<p>But when I would go into animation and work on my illustrated projects, people would come recruit me. They were like, &#8220;We like the work you&#8217;re doing? Come work on my film. You want to do character design for my film?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Yeah, sure. That sounds like fun.&#8221; And I got to meet a lot of people that way, but I also got to learn a lot about how the industry actually ran and how it functioned. And so I feel like that experience out of anything, because it wasn&#8217;t even a class I was taking. It was just extra stuff that I was doing outside of my classes. That taught me the most I think about what it looked like to actually work as a professional in the field.</p>
<p>And then I also did the Japan trip that was aforementioned in that brochure. I went to that Japan trip, and that was amazing too. So I got to meet a lot of friends, I got to go to Japan, I got to see animation studios up close. And that was just a really incredible experience. So SCAD gave me a lot. It&#8217;s also a very expensive school, so I can&#8217;t recommend it to everybody. But it really taught me a lot about what it looked like to work in the field. But also just that networking that I got from SCAD in particular was very, very valuable. Because a lot of those people cropped up in the future, and still are lifelong friends today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. And I&#8217;ve heard that SCAD has a really robust alumni program too, just in terms of not just the people who went there of course as alumni, but getting in touch for other opportunities and things like that. I&#8217;ve heard SCAD is really good about that.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Oh yeah, they&#8217;re really good about it. But I haven&#8217;t even tapped into the surface of those alumni programs yet. I have done their alumni Gaming Fest and Animation Fest, and I&#8217;ve done the alumni panels on that and talked about my experiences as a professional to the students.</p>
<p>And I actually had applied to teach SCAD. And this summer, I mentioned at the start of the episode that I had just went back to Atlanta. I had lost my job. And I knew that even before I had lost my job, I wanted to go teach eventually at SCAD Atlanta. It&#8217;s funny because they actually got back to me right after I got hired at Wizards so it was too late. I was like, &#8220;No, you got me just too late.&#8221; But yeah, that environment is like nothing else like that. Very creative, just very focused. And it reminds me why I love art so much, just being around students and being around all that creativity.</p>
<p>I felt the happiest at SCAD because really when you&#8217;re a student, you&#8217;re in a bubble. And you&#8217;re in a bubble of all this creativity and all this positivity. And so as an alumni, I do want to tap back into that, and find those resources, and meet my fellow alumni who are tapping into those programs too. But yeah, ultimately I also want to go back and teach, because you can take classes too, and I just want to learn more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you mentioned that part of the SCAD experience in terms of how they set up working on projects and things like that was very similar to how it was in the industry. So once you graduated from SCAD and you got out there in the field, you were working for Floyd County Productions. That was sort of right after SCAD?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Yes. So after I graduated SCAD, I opt to stay in the city because I didn&#8217;t want to go back to New Jersey. I love my family a lot, and they&#8217;re awesome people. But the environment of Jersey is not a creative environment at all. And I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I want to go back to Jersey where I&#8217;m leaving all these people and all this creativity. I want to really build my portfolio and cultivate my professional appearance, and what I&#8217;m going to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I stayed in the city at Savannah, which is an awesome city by the way. Everybody should visit it. And really got to hang out with my friends and develop my portfolio. And I started to post on various different freelance websites and got a few small freelance projects as well. But because I had put my portfolio on all these websites, I was also noticed by a background director at Floyd County Productions, which is a studio that makes Archer in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p>The manager had reached out to me and she said that, &#8220;Hey, I saw your work on freelance.com. I really like what you do. We would like you to take an art test for us and I want to see if you would be good to work as a background artist here.&#8221; And I was just like, &#8220;What?&#8221; My mind was blown. Because I didn&#8217;t know what I was going to do after I graduated. It&#8217;s weird because I didn&#8217;t remember having a bunch of anxiety around it, but I also just did not know what I was going to end up doing. I thought I just needed to develop more skills. But I was really fortunate to be able to get that email.</p>
<p>So she sent me an art test. It was a 24 hours to work on this art test. I took that to mean you do this art test in 24 hours right now. I used all 24 hours at this time too. I made sure that that thing was bomb. And it&#8217;s funny because it was like you had to treat a background like a bomb went off in it. It was already painted and then you had to really mess it up. And so I had a lot of fun doing that. I got critiqued from my friends and made sure that it was looking good, and submitted it. And I was like, &#8220;Okay, I hope I did a good enough job. I hope I did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And also, I was going to have a trip over to Atlanta for Dragon Con. So that still happened to fall around that same time. And so I messaged her all shyly and I was like, &#8220;Hey, I might be in town in two weeks. So is it okay if I visit the studio too?&#8221; I didn&#8217;t want to say it was Dragon Con because I didn&#8217;t know if that was acceptable or not. And she messaged me back and she was like, &#8220;You&#8217;re going for Dragon Con. Yeah sure, absolutely. You can come to the studio.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was such a little baby. It was really funny to think about me around that time because I just did not know. Because as soon as I walked into that studio environment when I got to visit, I was like, &#8220;This looks like just all of my classmates. This feels like college again.&#8221; Because everybody had toys on their desk, and everybody was really cool. And everybody was again, creative.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re a student, you think that professionals are this different breed of people. You think that they&#8217;re on this elevated, very buttoned up on this pedestal. And we&#8217;re really not. We&#8217;re so not. We&#8217;re not corporate, we&#8217;re artists. And it&#8217;s just like working with artists that you would work with as a student. We&#8217;re all creative and we&#8217;re all nerdy. We all have our own interests that we nerd out about and geek out about, and we get really obsessed about certain things. And so everybody really had that just laid back, chill kind of personality. And so it was very easy to get along with everybody because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m out of my element actually at all. This feels like SCAD.&#8221; And so I ended up getting hired after that trip two weeks later. And packed all my stuff, moved over to Atlanta, and found that the animation production cycle was exactly like how it was on films that I worked on at SCAD, where everybody had their different roles, there were different departments. It was a really collaborative environment there as well. And you had your team. That&#8217;s how I got over to Floyd County.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean it sounds fun. Even the environment that you mentioned, like working with all those artists and creatives is fun. I&#8217;ve mostly been a creative at tech startups. Not fun. They&#8217;re not fun. I mean if you want to nerd out about code or whatever, which I don&#8217;t really care about. But I remember I worked at one startup, and we would have our weekly all hands. And I mean these nerds would just go in on code for two hours straight. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I have work to do.&#8221; And they&#8217;re excited about it talking about containers and frameworks and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I have work to do.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m still looking to for that working with creatives experience like that, because it sounds like it would be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>When you look back at your experiences with studios though, I would imagine it probably wasn&#8217;t all fun. I mean after Floyd County Productions, you worked for four years at EA Mobile. You worked for two years at Zynga. What were those experiences like?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, I can get into those. But first I just want to address something too. It was definitely fun to be able to work in that creative environment with a bunch of creative peers, but it&#8217;s still work and you still have to show up and do the work. So after a while you&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Oh man, I&#8217;ve been working on the same background for two weeks now. I just really want to move on.&#8221;</p>
<p>And also the hours can be a lot because you&#8217;re in animation. You&#8217;re in a strict production cycle, especially for TV. And so sometimes, I think I&#8217;d worked once up to 80 hours one week. So it can be crazy. Yeah, I know. So that part&#8217;s not fun. It was my first experience becoming a lead, and a manager, and a director. Because I was promoted to background director shortly before I had left Floyd. I really wanted to protect my team from a lot of the brunt of that work, of the editing and of the long hours. And so I took on a lot of that myself with my lead. And that was a lot.</p>
<p>Then also after a season ends, you go on hiatus, which is basically laid off for about two or three months, which can happen in a lot of animation studios. And so you had to understand how to fend for yourself too during that time. And so it was really fun to work in an environment like that, but it can also be very stressful. And so that&#8217;s something to consider as well. I don&#8217;t want to sugarcoat what it&#8217;s like to work in animation, because there&#8217;s definitely drawbacks to certain studios and certain environments. Other studios that have union, you don&#8217;t have to deal with that as much. But I&#8217;ve never worked under a union studio before, so I can&#8217;t speak to that as well. But it&#8217;s just something to look out for and something that people have to determine whether or not they want to go into.</p>
<p>I felt like I could handle it because I was young. I can&#8217;t handle that now. I&#8217;m too old for that. I really can&#8217;t. But back then I had the stamina to deal with it, but there was also burnout. And so I was kind of thankful for hiatus because it was an opportunity to really recharge my batteries and do personal work as well. Because when I was working full-time, I couldn&#8217;t really dedicate that much time to personal work. So there&#8217;s definitely a lot of give and take.</p>
<p>I will say I do miss the people and I miss the kind of work that I did. Because when I went over to EA, it was my first time going into game development. I decided to leave animation just because I was ready to explore something new. My friend told me, he went over to EA a year prior and he told me how the environment was, and what they were working on, and that I would be a good fit.<br>
And so when I interviewed there, I realized that the experience was very parallel to what I was already doing in animation. And so I was like, &#8220;Okay, I think maybe I don&#8217;t fill all the qualifications for this, but I fit most of them. And I might as well go for it anyway.&#8221; And ended up getting hired at EA.</p>
<p>So I left Atlanta, which I was really sad about. I was not ready to leave Atlanta. I loved the city, and that&#8217;s why I came back. I realized that I&#8217;d fallen in love with it right before I left. So I was like, &#8220;Oh no.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I went over to Austin and Austin is also really cool, but it was a lot of change as well. I went over to EA, which was so much more of a corporate environment. Because EA is a huge studio and it has a lot of systems in place, and process in place, and a lot of very clear defined roles, and clear defined things that you&#8217;re supposed to do. And you can&#8217;t say everything that you used to say in a very informal environment like an animation, and you have to make sure that you&#8217;re careful about following all the rules. And so it was an interesting adjustment. It was a bit of a culture shock at first, but I found that I could roll with that as well.</p>
<p>Also, the people that I worked with too. Again, really awesome people. Gaming nerds, which I am also a gaming nerd. But like you were saying about your tech startup, it&#8217;s a lot more technical. And so there were a lot of things at first that really went over my head. I didn&#8217;t know what Scrum was. I was like, &#8220;What is agile? What is code base? What is all this stuff?&#8221; Working in an engine for the first time, and understanding that you had to make art a certain way to fit into the engine, and you had to optimize stuff. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What is all this integration?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What does all this mean? I don&#8217;t know what any of this means.&#8221; But I learned all of that probably within the course of three months. And just letting you know, even what I learned is different from game to game. So a lot of that experience can translate and a lot of it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I was really determined to do a good job at EA and to really work hard because I was a senior and lead environment artist. And so I had people to manage as well. And so I was learning a lot, and they were teaching me a lot about the process as well. But I really loved working with my fellow artists and my team.</p>
<p>And the games that we were working on, I can&#8217;t talk about the first game that we worked on, but we started working on The Simpsons Tapped Out shortly after, which was a live service mobile game that had been out for a while. And so being able to meet the people who had made the game and then understanding what it took to make a live service and talking to a licensor for the first time. That was just a lot of new learning experiences.</p>
<p>But it was also the first time where I really started to see the disparity of the industry, and the fact that it wasn&#8217;t very diverse. I started to really feel that in the city of Austin in general, and my environment reflected that. And I was working in Atlanta. So before, it was a very diverse place. And now I was like, &#8220;I feel at times, very isolated.&#8221; And I wanted to work to change that.</p>
<p>So I think at EA is really where I started to develop my professional voice as well as my sense for advocacy, and really started to want to actively work to make change in the game industry. Because I wanted to see more people who look like me, doing what I was doing.</p>
<p>Because I felt very fortunate, but I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m that special. I feel like everybody can do what I&#8217;m doing if they really work towards it, and they really go for it. I feel like again, I&#8217;ve been fortunate to be able to get these opportunities and to be able to make these friends. But I wanted to start teaching people how to get to where I was.</p>
<p>So what EA has are things called employee resource groups where there&#8217;re groups to advocate for a certain underrepresented group of people. So there was a pride one, there was a Latin one, there was a Black one. And there was a disabilities one as well. There wasn&#8217;t an Austin chapter of the Black ERG. And so I started it with a few coworkers. And we made a Black EA Team Austin, BEAT Austin, and started to do advocacy work around the city, around the industry. And that&#8217;s when I really started to do mentorships and started to do work like this where I actively did panels at Dragon Con and other conventions, and started to really talk about my experiences and be visible as one of the people who was a leader in the industry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How did that experience go?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
It was really interesting. Because at first, I felt very shy. I said this story on a SCAD panel, but I feel like I started my end career very quiet because I was a Black woman, and now I&#8217;m leading it loud because I&#8217;m a Black woman. Because I really had the sense that people didn&#8217;t quite know how to handle me. One of my managers had told me that he felt intimidated by me. And I feel like I&#8217;m the opposite of an intimidating person. I&#8217;m a very huggy, affectionate, just dorky person. And the fact that he felt intimidated by me, I was like, &#8220;It&#8217;s probably because I&#8217;m Black.&#8221;</p>
<p>But also, if I am going to have somebody feel intimidated by me and he expects me to be intimidating, then I&#8217;m just going to be intimidating and ask all the questions that I really want to ask, and start saying the things that maybe I wouldn&#8217;t have said if I was feeling a little shyer. Because with that intimidation, I was like, &#8220;He must respect me a little bit too. So maybe I can just say some things.&#8221; And in a professional way always, of course. But maybe I can start to speak my mind a little bit more and start to talk about the things that I&#8217;m observing. And I started to do that. And it was actually well received.</p>
<p>And so that experience was really enlightening for me because I was like, &#8220;I actually have a voice now.&#8221; At Floyd, I was a young creative. I just started, so I didn&#8217;t really want to express myself. I didn&#8217;t really want to be a contrarian, because I was just afraid of what people would say. I just didn&#8217;t have the confidence yet. I started to build the confidence at EA and started to really start to call people out and, &#8220;Hey, why are we not thinking about these things? Why are we not thinking about what this Black character is doing or saying, or the fact that we&#8217;re even having Black characters in this game?&#8221;</p>
<p>The designer that I started doing the ERG with, we used to do a Valentine&#8217;s event for Tapped Out every February. And he was like, &#8220;This time we should do a Black history event.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;We should do a Black history event. Let&#8217;s do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so things like that are things that I would&#8217;ve never thought to advocate for when I was working in animation. And I really started to advocate for it and started to really gain my identity too as a Black creative, when I started in the game industry. And it felt very empowering. And I really felt like I could really use my voice, because there were so few people who looked like me. There were no other Black female game developers at the time I was working at EA. And also when I moved on to Zynga four years later, there was still no other Black female game devs except for, I think there was the VP art director, which was really cool to see a woman like that in management and leadership. But that was the first time I had really seen someone like that. And it shouldn&#8217;t have taken that long. It shouldn&#8217;t have taken five years for me to see that. So I really wanted to work to change it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, good on you for really stepping into that. Stepping into that sort of, I guess vacancy that you saw. And being an advocate not just for yourself, but for other Black people, Black women particularly in the industry.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
It wasn&#8217;t easy because I also had to deal with people not understanding why things were important, not understanding why I prioritized the stuff. I didn&#8217;t let it get in the way of my workload. But we actually started to advocate at EA for all of our advocacy work and all of the things that we were doing to actually count towards our year end reviews and performance, and to be an actual positive mark. And so it actually became a company mandate. Through all of our being vocal, it became a company mandate for ERG work to be considered as a part of our performance review. And so it encouraged more people to join ERGs, and more people to advocate. And I think that it ultimately funneled up to become something really positive.</p>
<p>And so it worked in spite of any pushback that I got and any misunderstanding that it received, because then the company started to really back it. And that was really, really rewarding. So I feel really grateful to have a voice that was respected and had been a part of that change. But I still want to continue to do that in my work at Wizards as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What gives you purpose to keep doing the work that you do? What is it that keeps you empowered and motivated?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
I think when I was talking to a student at an event that I was doing, this was when I was still at EA. I was talking to him and he was like, &#8220;These are the things that I&#8217;m interested in, but I don&#8217;t know if I even fit in the game industry or where I could go.&#8221; And he was like, &#8220;I really like engineering, but I also like doing art.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I told him, I was like, &#8220;Hey you know, there&#8217;s a whole field just for you called tech art, where you get to be an engineer for artists.&#8221; And to see his eyes light up in that moment was the takeaway for me, because I got to help somebody realize that there&#8217;s space for them in the industry, and that there&#8217;s somewhere that they can fit. And so something that I love to do is to see, and mentor people, and give them reviews and give them advice. And then see them sometime later, actually break into the industry and do the job that they always wanted to do.</p>
<p>So being an influence for people to go for something that they would not have previously thought they could go for is such a rewarding experience for me to be able to give somebody that, because I feel like I&#8217;ve been really fortunate in the people who have supported me, and my parents being a support for me, but also my friends standing by me and advocating for me, recommending me to these things. I wanted to be able to provide that helping hand for other people. I wanted to be able to give back. And so that&#8217;s what really keeps me motivated is to be able to give back and see it really come to fruition.</p>
<p>But I also really want to make a more diverse game industry. I grew up playing games where very few people in those games look like me. And the more people we have behind the scenes making these games, the more diverse it&#8217;s going to get, and the more inclusive it&#8217;s going to become. And then the more accessible games will be for people who look like me. And so maybe we won&#8217;t think of it as an impossibility once we start to see faces to these games, and see people on the stage talking about what their experiences were making these games. And I think eventually, we will start to see that more and more. We&#8217;re already seeing it more and more.<br>
So if I can get at least one Black person in the industry, or one Black woman in the industry, or somebody who didn&#8217;t believe in themselves to believe in themselves to do it, then I&#8217;ll have succeeded at my job. And I think it&#8217;s already happened a few times, so I feel like I&#8217;ve succeeded at my job. But I want to keep that going. Because I really believe that paying it forward is really our step to a better future in gaming, but just in the world in general. So I want to be a part of that change.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And speaking of paying it forward, I have to bring this up that you&#8217;re also a podcaster as well. You have a show called Painted in Color. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Yeah. So we started Painted in Color in 2020. And previously, I kind of always wanted to start some kind of YouTube show or podcast, but I was always too afraid to do it or I was like, &#8220;What could I say that anybody would even listen to?&#8221; But after doing all that advocacy work in the game industry, I realized that I do have a point of view that people don&#8217;t get to hear that much. And so I really wanted to take the opportunity to share that.</p>
<p>Around the time we started Painted in Color, this is in 2020 right after the protests were happening. And people started to really take notice for the first time, some for the first time that Black game devs, or Black animators, or Black creatives in the industry were really not getting their dues. Started to really reach out with different opportunities. But I found myself both feeling pleased at this, but also frustrated that it took this long. And there was also a show that I was on, like a podcast. I&#8217;m not going to mention them by name, but they had run for six years, and I was only the third Black person on the show. Yeah, I know right?</p>
<p>And they interview people all the time. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why did it take this long?&#8221; I actually called them out on the show about this too. It was live, so they couldn&#8217;t do anything about it. It was something that really needed to be called out. But I really thought about that and took it to heart. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why was it that I was only the third Black person on the show?&#8221; There are so many Black creatives out there, and so many people who have great stories, and people who are highly talented, who haven&#8217;t really gotten a platform to share it.</p>
<p>And so when all these things were happening, we had a female fantastic art group about fantasy art. Somebody was talking about, &#8220;We want shows that are really uplifting, like women, and minorities, and creatives.&#8221; And I commented in that post saying that I really wanted to start something like that. And one of my friends who I had met at a convention had also commented on that post saying that she wanted to start something like that. Until she reached out to me on Facebook and said, &#8220;Hey, I saw that you commented that you wanted to start a show. Do you want to start a show together?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Heck yes I want to start a show together. That sounds awesome.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we started it with Esther Wu, Mia Araujo, and ended up pulling Eric Wilkerson, who&#8217;s also a fantasy artist, amazing painter, into our show. But we wanted to make a show that was dedicated to uplifting underrepresented artists in the industry. And we wanted to tell their stories, and interview them, and really get them to talk about the true experiences of what it was like to be an artist. We didn&#8217;t want to run it like a typical art podcast where people tell you, &#8220;You have to do this to succeed. You have to be like this.&#8221; Because it often comes from a white male perspective, and that&#8217;s not everybody&#8217;s perspective. And people can also feel very down on themselves when they can&#8217;t do all the things that people are prescribing them.</p>
<p>So we wanted to talk about all of our nuanced perspectives, and we ended up talking about a lot of mental health aspects as well. Because we were all going through it. Obviously it was the pandemic. It was a really hard time mental health wise for each of us and everybody. And it kind of ended up becoming that too organically, even though that wasn&#8217;t a part of the goal. But I&#8217;m happy that it became a part of the show, because it really showed a perspective from professionals that were still struggling in some kind of way. So we wanted to talk about our struggles and talk about how we were working to gain better mindsets around those struggles, and better perspectives around it. And a lot of the artists that came on our show also talked about those perspectives as well. And we got to hear about so many different journeys, and it was so inspiring to be able to get their sensibility and how they learn and grow. And so we started in 2020 at LightBox Expo Virtual. We had a panel discussion about what it was like to be a creative in the industry as an underrepresented group.</p>
<p>And we kept going from there. So we air biweekly on Mondays. We&#8217;ve been doing it for two years now. We&#8217;re about to air an interview soon with somebody amazing named Michael Uwandi, who started something similar, 9B Collective, which is a creative group over in LA that employs underrepresented artists and Black artists who work in the film industry, which is really awesome. We got a chance to really start to exercise that voice and grow our presence over time. And it&#8217;s been really, really fun and rewarding, and super inspiring. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m currently continuing to do now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;ve definitely checked out the podcast, and I&#8217;ll make sure that we put a link to it also in the show notes. I know 100% that feeling of being on a show that has not had a lot of Black guests, and you ask them. And then there&#8217;s all this hemming and hawing and, &#8220;Well, we tried.&#8221; Yeah. Okay, sure.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
A lot of the excuses too from recruiters as well and from shows is, &#8220;We don&#8217;t know where to find them. It doesn&#8217;t seem like there&#8217;s that many of them.&#8221; There are a myriad of us. We are everywhere. It&#8217;s really sad what&#8217;s going on with Twitter right now, because Twitter was actually how a lot of places had found me to interview me. I didn&#8217;t an article with Apple on the App Store. And so when people opened the app store, they saw my face. And that was because of Twitter, because there&#8217;s hashtags called drawing while Black, Black and gaming, I am POC and play. All these hashtags that really elevate the presence of underrepresented artists and minorities in the industry. And I hope that we don&#8217;t lose that platform because that was a really big presence for us. And so it&#8217;s a shame that has happened, because it was proof that we were out there. And we were present in droves, and a lot of really amazing talent too.</p>
<p>And so that excuse was really invalid. It was just because companies and people didn&#8217;t want to put the effort forward to look in different spaces than they were used to looking. If your spaces are only netting a certain kind of artist, then you probably need to change up the spaces that you&#8217;re looking in.</p>
<p>So I really want to emphasize that a lot in the show and as well as all the panels that I do, because I really do think it&#8217;s a matter of effort. There&#8217;s a lot of excuses that go around about it, and people, they&#8217;re not used to making that effort.<br>
And we&#8217;ve had to make that effort for years. We&#8217;ve had to code switch, we&#8217;ve had to be twice as good, four times as good in order to get into the industry. So if people don&#8217;t want to make that effort, it&#8217;s time to start now. Because we&#8217;ve been doing that for a long time, and we know what it&#8217;s like to go above and beyond constantly. So we would like to be met halfway a little bit please.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Listen, I did a whole presentation called Where Are the Black Designers in 2015. Because so many companies were asking me that. They had found out about the show, and they would be like, &#8220;Where are you finding all these people?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;On LinkedIn, on Twitter. I&#8217;m just reaching out and talking to them. Are you not doing the same things? My melanin doesn&#8217;t grant me any special search powers. I don&#8217;t have Black spidey sense or whatever. I&#8217;m just talking to people. Are you not talking to people?&#8221; And they&#8217;re not. They&#8217;re not putting forth even the baseline amount of effort.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
The minimum amount of effort. Yeah, and my LinkedIn started to also get very diverse because I just started to follow more people who were talking about these things. And that&#8217;s really what you have to do. When you follow people who discuss these issues, people who are in the industry will respond and comment. It&#8217;s very easy, in fact, to find these people. Just follow a few DEI experts on LinkedIn to start with if people are listening to this and wondering how. Follow people like Crystle Johnson who talks about DEI issues in the industry all the time. And people will comment and say like, &#8220;Hey, this is what my experiences are.&#8221; People share their stories in these LinkedIn posts. And so that&#8217;s a great way to start finding more Black talent and Black creatives. Or maybe make a post yourself and be like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m doing a search for Black creatives. I just want people to comment and see who I find.&#8221; I&#8217;ve just done that on Twitter as well.</p>
<p>I do several times a year when these hashtags start to go around. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hey, drop your portfolio in the comments. I would love to be able to follow these artists, and be able to follow you, and see what you&#8217;re creating.&#8221; So there&#8217;s so many different ways, like the hashtags I dropped earlier, so many different ways to find Black creatives or just creatives of color, diverse talent, underrepresented artists, people with disabilities. Any group that you&#8217;re looking for, you will find them. We are around, and we talk about these things all the time. So it really, really isn&#8217;t that hard. You just have to know where to look. You just have to do some research, find places to look. And then you&#8217;ll start to open up your dashboards and broaden them. And you&#8217;ll learn something along the way too. So please do that. Cannot tell you how many times I&#8217;ve had to tell people this, too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What have you learned along the way from the podcast? What has it taught you?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
I can&#8217;t even go into all the things that it&#8217;s taught me. But I think one of the most important things that it&#8217;s taught me to be curious. Always be curious about learning something new, and growing, and being self-aware of who you are, and what it is like to work in your own mind, and how to work with yourself to be the best you.</p>
<p>Because again, a lot of shows will talk about, &#8220;Here&#8217;s what you have to do to be successful.&#8221; But if being successful means that you have to get up in the morning every day at 8:00 AM and you know you&#8217;re not a morning person, you&#8217;re not going to do that. You&#8217;re forcing yourself to do something that you hate doing. So what do you do instead? If you&#8217;re a night owl, then maybe do the bulk of your work at night where you know that your brain is awake during, and that you work with your own body. You know you get bored about working out? Then maybe switch up your routine every now and again. The fact that you&#8217;ve fallen off of a routine is not a failure. You just need something new to mix it up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same way with any kind of aspect. Know yourself and work with yourself to be your definition of success, because success means something different for every single person. You can&#8217;t follow one set prescription of success. And so work with yourself the way you need to in order to get to your brand of success. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve learned about the show the most, because every single person who&#8217;s started to do the things that really make them happy has followed not the rules of society, but their own rules of how they best function and what makes them happy. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve taken away the most from the show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How have you worked to stay your authentic self throughout your career? I get this very strong sense of one, I think determination. But also, it&#8217;s coming from a very earnest place. It&#8217;s not grand-standing or anything like that. It&#8217;s coming from a real, genuine place. How have you worked to keep that authenticity?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
I learned not to compromise myself anymore. Not just in my art, but just personally as well. If there is something that I feel very strongly about, I know automatically that it is not for me, or it is for me. And I pursue it, or I reject it however I need to. But I&#8217;ve learned that the person who I am will attract the people who I want in my life. And compromising myself and being inauthentic is going to bring around the wrong people that I don&#8217;t want to be involved with.</p>
<p>And even though I&#8217;m an introvert, I thrive around people who understand me. And in order to be understood, I have to share myself. And I have to really share who I am as a person, not just a veneer of myself. And so I think that&#8217;s what keeps me authentic, because being authentic just makes me happier. And sharing my point of view makes me really understand who I am. even more.<br>
So I have a little anecdote. There was a convention called Gen Con that it was a prestigious convention. And they had amazing fantasy artists that had been in the industry for 20, 30 years. And I got in somehow. Somehow.</p>
<p>And I was so intimidated by this convention. I was just like, &#8220;Oh my God, I don&#8217;t have art that looks like anybody else&#8217;s. What am I going to do? I don&#8217;t know what to create.&#8221; And I psyched myself out so hard that I didn&#8217;t make any new work for this con, and I was meant to sell my artwork there.</p>
<p>And the last few weeks before this convention had started, I was like, &#8220;Oh my God, I haven&#8217;t made anything. What do I do?&#8221; And I was like okay. I had a moment with myself. I was like, &#8220;I got in not because of what other artists looked like, but because what my art looked like. They accepted me for me. So why would I not make anything that looks like me? Why would I want to make anything that looks like anybody else&#8217;s, if they asked me to be in the show for what my portfolio looked like?&#8221;<br>
And so what I ended up doing was making the most self-indulgent piece ever, which was the Mushroom Queen piece that&#8217;s on my website if anybody wants to look at it. But it was just fully 100% my authentic viewpoint. And I was like okay. I went to the show. I set it up. I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen, but it&#8217;s going to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that was by far my best show that I had ever done. I&#8217;d been doing conventions for about 10 years at this point, and it was the most successful, the most positive experience ever. And that piece that I made was the most sold print. I sold out of that print. And it went to show me that being authentic is really what is going to get me that far. Because people are there for my voice, and so my voice I will give them. And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m authentic. That&#8217;s why I try to be authentic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project or something that you&#8217;d love to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s so many things that I want to do. I am ADHD, and so I want to bounce around between many different things. But what I&#8217;ve always wanted to do is make a video game, and an animated pitch, and a comic, and a graphic novel, and an art book, and a tarot card deck. So I have so many different dream projects.</p>
<p>Because I think the thing about dream projects is that once you&#8217;re done, you have to find a new dream. And so I have several dreams, and I want to pursue each of them one by one. And so the tarot deck is coming first. I&#8217;m going to be making a deck called the Avant Garden, which it&#8217;s a part of the Mushroom Queen series and the Rose Queen that I&#8217;ve made. They&#8217;re all different plant queens that have their own gardens. And I want to make a full deck based off of those, that project.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I want to do first. I would really love to make a small game with a small team. But something that is meaningful, and special, and beautiful. And many different stories I have in my head. So I want to just work towards each of these different goals as I go forward in my journey as an artist. But I have several dream projects that that I want to work on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? I feel like there&#8217;s this sort of wellspring of creativity that you could really just dive into.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s so much that wants to get out of my head, and I really just think it&#8217;s in the doing. But with the podcast Painted in Color, I really want to create it as a community in the future, and start to do live events, and start to have art retreats, and create classes around the podcast so that it&#8217;s an actual active learning experience for students. Where a lot of the people who are on the show can mentor and we can mentor as well. And really create something that is a positive environment that starts to cultivate talent of color and underrepresented talent for the industry.</p>
<p>I also would love to eventually start my own studio. I would like to say at Wizards for a good while, but eventually my old hermit plan is to start my own studio and to draw together a bunch of wonderful people who I&#8217;ve worked with in the past who I know are amazing and are good people. And start to create products that really inspire and uplift the next generation of gamers or animators in the industry. So that&#8217;s where I start to see myself. But in the next five years, I really want to make my podcast a really good, strong network, and a strong presence in the industry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work, your artwork and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ve tried to make it as easy as possible. So I have a Linktree. Everywhere online is LAB illustration. Labillustration, that&#8217;s my initials, Lauren Brown. And so labillustration on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Patreon, Etsy. I have an Etsy store. Everywhere you can find me, it&#8217;s labillustration. I have a Linktree to make that easier. So it&#8217;s linktr.ee/labillustration. That&#8217;s where you can find all of my links.</p>
<p>Painted in Color is on YouTube currently. We&#8217;re looking to expand it soon, but right now it&#8217;s only on YouTube. And that is youtube.com/c/paintedincolor. And so that&#8217;s where our channel is. And so that&#8217;s mainly where you can find me. So I hope that you do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hope people do too. Sounds good. Lauren Brown, thank you so, so much for coming on the show. Thank you for just really sharing your story of being a Black woman in illustration, in art direction, and sort of giving I think a really good behind the scenes look at what it looks like to not just be in this industry, but also to be an advocate for underrepresented voices in the industry. I mean, you&#8217;re doing that not just in the media you&#8217;re making, but also with your podcast. I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing what you do in the next five years. I&#8217;m definitely going to keep an eye out. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Lauren Brown:</b><br>
Thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate this, Maurice.</p>

<p>December is a good time to take stock and think about how to approach the new year ahead. And for this week&#8217;s guest, Lawrence Humphrey, this year was about striking out on his own and starting <a href="https://www.pearl.us.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Pearl</a>, a peer-based leadership consulting platform where he serves as CEO.</p>
<p>We began by talking about the origin story of Pearl, and Lawrence walked me through the platform and spoke on how collaboration is a big part of how he makes everything work. He also shared how he started out as an engineer, talked about how his tenure at IBM inspired him to found <a href="https://tcdb.webflow.io/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Tech Can [Do] Better</a>, and gave recognition to those who have helped him achieve the success he has today. According to Lawrence, the best outcomes are a result of bringing diverse people together &#8212; a great message that we can all take to heart!</p>

All right, so tell us who you are and what you do?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Hi, yeah, so I&#8217;m Lawrence Humphrey. I&#8217;m founder, CEO of Pearl, and I as a very new startup, very stereotypically, I do everything from setting the strategy, building the team, to executing against the strategy, executing it against myself, to taken out the trash and cleaning up the floor, so to speak. So very much the stereotypical start-up journey right now. But yeah, I do it all. It&#8217;s been really exciting. As a nosy person, I love being able to stick my nose in everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going so far? I feel like the second half of this year has been plagued by news about tech layoffs and things like that. How have you been holding up?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, this has been a very, let&#8217;s say, uncomfortable year, but not, obviously there are the greater, as you mentioned, societal forces making people uncomfortable, the job uncertainty. I am one of the people that quit my job this year to go full-time with Pearl. So my discomfort is more for from, and I get discomfort and excitement for having taken that leap. And I mean this is my first rodeo, so to speak. So I&#8217;m excited, and it&#8217;s very much, and I don&#8217;t have kids, but I have so much optimism for this kid and I&#8217;d want to make sure I raise them in order to be, I want it to be successful. So that&#8217;s been a super fulfilling journey and definitely a venture into uncharted territory for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, anytime you step out there and do your own thing for the first time, it is equal parts like exhilarating and terrifying. You have so much freedom, but you also really want to make sure that it actually succeeds.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
And I&#8217;ve been telling people that both the highs and lows are much more, they have a higher magnitude. I feel the highs more. I mean, because they&#8217;re my doing, this is because of direct output from my input, which the same could be said for the lows. So I&#8217;m getting used to the swings and trying to approach them with more equanimity, so not get necessarily as whipped around by them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, going into next year into 2023, do you have any kind of big resolutions or goals that you want to accomplish?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I mean, the big one and very practically is to be working on Pearl and that&#8217;s like the low-hanging fruit. Ideally, and I haven&#8217;t quantified this yet, I haven&#8217;t actually run the projections, but I would like for there to be a healthy amount of organic collaboration instead of me, let&#8217;s say heavy handedly really, really guiding people&#8217;s hand using the platform. Ideally we would have some early evangelists and the early adopters, just really giving us good data, using it, driving value from it. Beyond that, I mean I&#8217;m very shortsighted right now with just making sure that the business is set up for success long term and doing what, and I haven&#8217;t done my 2023 strategic planning yet. That&#8217;s going to be the next few weeks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s talk more about Pearl, which I see here is described as &#8220;a platform that makes finding actionable hiring solutions from vetted and diverse leaders easy.&#8221; Tell me more about it.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
So this is born from, and it&#8217;s kind of without getting into the full origin story, maybe we&#8217;ll get there. The observations that I&#8217;ve seen, are we have no shortage of collaboration tools, a lot of which come to mind, let&#8217;s say the Slacks, the Teams, even HBR articles to get thought leadership.</p>
<p>But there is a shortage of solutions that A, get us out of our own echo chambers into finding, I mean really practically, let&#8217;s say what do women think about hiring? Where are women hiring, et cetera. And also the follow-up to that is a lot of it is quote unquote like thought leadership and not the boots on the ground practical work, the practical instructions and recipes that these users or these leaders have used in order to drive results.</p>
<p>And I see these both working together in this very pernicious cycle of we continue to reinvent the wheel, we&#8217;re slower in terms of delivering outcomes, we deliver worse outcomes. People feel like worse leaders because they&#8217;re not getting connected to the work that in most cases already exist from the leaders that have done it. So that&#8217;s the opportunity that I see with Pearl. And we&#8217;re starting with a problem that all leaders have or will face hiring. So this is where we&#8217;re at the first step of our journey in proving out our value prop. So without getting into the origin story, that&#8217;s what Pearl is here to solve.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, look, get into the origin story. Where did the ideas sort of come from?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
So for that, it starts two years ago and the name of that org was Tech Can [Do] Better. And the week after George Floyd was murdered, I was still working at IBM and I noticed how my company at the time and the tech industry, and not just the tech industry, but that&#8217;s just where I live and breathe. They threw their hands up and they were bemused about what could be done to drive racial equity and what ways are we perpetuating it, how could this happen? And I got really frustrated at the confusion and how frantic the industry was knowing that I&#8217;d been on the inside with some of my coworkers, predominantly other black tech employees, advocating for what racial equity looked like within our company. And it felt like at the time we just got pats on the head. And Tech Can [Do] Better was my response to basically remove any obstacle that a tech company could have, like I don&#8217;t know what to do, where to go.</p>
<p>And I co-authored essentially a white paper with other black and brown folks from across the industry to outline very actionable steps about how to drive racial equity, whether you were an executive middle manager, independent contributor, anywhere in between, this is how you can get started with racial equity. And I think we hosted a dozen community calls, had people representing 50 companies from across the industry to help get each other unstuck. And that was when I realized that there was a demand and let&#8217;s say an overlooked opportunity and unsolved pain point for having very actionable perspective from black and brown perspectives, but even more broadly, it just exposed a lot of collaboration hiccups and we weren&#8217;t making it easy to get the answers we need. So it started there. And the other half of the story, I&#8217;ve been a leader with Pearl for almost two years, or a little over two years now.</p>
<p>And I find myself reinventing the wheel every day. And I mean hiring is just one of them. And I wrote the white paper for what diverse hiring looks like, and I assembled all of these diverse hiring sources and I still have trouble doing it. So even for me, very selfishly, I&#8217;m creating this tool to hopefully mitigate reinventing the wheel over and over again for all of these what I perceive to be mostly solved problems. I have to imagine hiring in any capacity is roughly 80% solved. And it&#8217;s just a matter of getting that answer and putting my own little Lawrence Humphrey customization on it, or Maurice, you customize it that last 20%, but I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of starting from 20% and then building out 80%, which is an abject waste of time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I see. I mean it&#8217;s interesting because you know mentioned that this sort of came out from the summer of 2020 and a lot of companies certainly had those pledges to quote unquote &#8220;do better&#8221; in whatever way that meant for them in terms of diversity and inclusion. And it feels like now two plus years out from it that some of those promises have kind of started to wane a little bit. Is Pearl kind of a way to hold companies like this accountable?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I will agree that I&#8217;ve seen the demand and let&#8217;s say the attention wane, and I wouldn&#8217;t say Pearl is a way to hold them accountable. I think Tech Can [Do] Better was more that than Pearl is. One of my philosophies is I think that as a designer, my design background here is if users will do whatever is easiest in most cases or whatever the system sets them up to do, and Pearl is an aim to make doing the right thing easier, I&#8217;d venture to say in my learnings with Tech Can [Do] Better, there are no shortage of people who want to be practicing racial equity at work, showing up in a more human way, building diverse teams, fostering inclusive collaboration.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just that they don&#8217;t have the tools, and let&#8217;s say the literal practical tools like the software and let&#8217;s say the soft skills tools to actually do those things. So Pearl is trying to make doing the right thing easier and less about accountability, pointing fingers, et cetera, et cetera. It&#8217;s assuming positive intent, and connecting people that want to be doing the right thing but not, might not know where to start.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m looking at the website now. I see you&#8217;ve got a great diverse team of advisors behind you. What does a regular day look like for you working on Pearl?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Being so early, and I&#8217;m sure it changes at some point, but every day looks really different and to the extent that I have any sort of consistency in my routine, it&#8217;s more location based. I love going to coffee shops, so I&#8217;ll go in the AM to the coffee shop to do my heads down, deep thinking work where I will do everything from craft social media, marketing outreach, to working on the product itself, to planning out what features need to be added, prioritizing from feedback that I heard in user interviews, what releases need to happen and when. And then in the afternoon, usually I have my calls either with my team, with potential customer discovery interviews, with my advisors, and that&#8217;s usually when I do my more, let&#8217;s say, not heads down work, but by and large the shape of each day from the outside might look similar. But what I&#8217;m doing is very different day to day. I mean, I can&#8217;t say I take many podcast calls right now, so already [inaudible 00:14:09] quite the variety that I&#8217;m getting right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, you got to get the word out about what you&#8217;re doing, so you have to do a little bit of press here and there.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, no, I 100% agree. And I had a release last Monday where I opened up Pearl to close family friends, I mean the social media, the people within my first, second degree connections. And I was joking that I feel like I need to go on tour now. I dropped my little EP and I&#8217;m shopping it around and seeing how it lands, getting people to listen to it, getting them to download my mix tape and all that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So let&#8217;s say that I&#8217;m a company or I&#8217;m a leader of a company that&#8217;s interested in Pearl, what does the onboarding process look like?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, so right now, and I guess it&#8217;s worth backing up and just talking through Pearl is a B2B and B2C, you can think of a GitHub or even a FigMore or Slack or something like that. So there are two avenues for which you can get engaged and I know you were talking about that B2B version. For that you can reach out to us and pilot with us and you can do that from our website. But the onboarding looks like an opening call where we can do some intros. I can tell you, I mean maybe if you are listening to this, I won&#8217;t have to tell you as much about Pearl, but we do some discovery to hear which pain points are you most struggling with. The few use cases that I identified are basically we&#8217;re helpful in smoothing out the transition between either people joining or leaving your team.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s say you are getting rid of some folks, which is timely, whether they&#8217;re either leaving or they got laid off, that work doesn&#8217;t just evaporate, it usually gets reallocated somewhere between the team. And it&#8217;s about helping them codify that work such that whomever is picking it up, it minimizes the time between zero to 60 and getting up to speed.</p>
<p>And then whenever they backfill that person, minimizing the friction of getting them caught up to speed. So that&#8217;s one use case. We&#8217;re also useful in kicking off projects that have multiple stakeholders either within or outside the company that require frequent and high-touch collaboration. So a couple of use cases that we talk out on that call and then fleshing out what success looks like at the end of a two to four-week sprint, it&#8217;s very much responding in the in-person just live in the meeting for where we can add the most value. Like I said, it&#8217;s more important to me to add value and see how folks are using Pearl, and it&#8217;s about figuring out where that sweet spot is between what problems they&#8217;re having and what I see Pearl being poised to solve.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the most challenging parts about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Oh, boy. I think that this might be, I&#8217;m just going to think out loud here and I might have to, I might discover the answer, so just more talking it out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Because this is my first rodeo, I feel like I have a strong intuitive sense for what I feel like needs to be done at any given time. At the same time, I&#8217;m grappling with the fact that practically and in reality, because I&#8217;ve not done this, I cannot fully trust my intuition for what should be done. And for that I have advisors and knowing when to pull them in, and I usually bounce ideas off of them, but it is just truly the, I&#8217;m meandering, like I said, into this uncharted territory with very little visibility of what&#8217;s in front of me. And it&#8217;s just navigating the ambiguity in a way that it makes me feel like I can confidently chart the course and bring other people in.</p>
<p>Luckily, I&#8217;ve had great advisors and because I don&#8217;t have a team of 100, I don&#8217;t really have to justify my decisions to many people. But sometimes it&#8217;s just like the day-to-day, I have no clue if this is going to work and I just try something, and if it doesn&#8217;t work, and I don&#8217;t mean no one likes failing, but it&#8217;s just I&#8217;m getting used to things not going according to plan more so than they do go according to plan. The self-management, I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the right way to say it, but just that keeping my own, keeping the wind in my own sails. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the way to say it now, I&#8217;ll probably think of a more eloquent way to say it as soon as we [inaudible 00:18:45]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But to keep that but to keep that motivation going essentially, right?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, and just like it is the age old, all right, &#8220;I tried six things, none of them went according to plan,&#8221; and you know have that day you get off a call where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;That did not go like I wanted it to go,&#8221; and at the same time tomorrow I&#8217;m going to get up and do it all over again. You got to keep pushing through. But yeah, that motivation&#8217;s huge.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I don&#8217;t know, as you were describing that, it sort of reminded me of that old Donald Rumsfeld quote about how there&#8217;s &#8220;known knowns&#8221; and there&#8217;s &#8220;unknown unknowns.&#8221; And it sounds like certainly I think with venturing into a start-up of something like this where you&#8217;re trying to, you don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know, so even as you&#8217;re trying to build this product and build this company, there are other things down the line that you may encounter that you don&#8217;t really have an idea of. But that&#8217;s why you&#8217;ve got advisors to hopefully kind of help you out and to give you that foresight.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Exactly, and I mean it&#8217;s not an unknown phenomenon. There is, it always doesn&#8217;t work right before it does. And that&#8217;s what keeping me going. And I read another quote and I think it was, and this might be exposing one of my little guilty pleasures here, but there is this book called &#8220;Tiny Beautiful Things.&#8221; Cheryl Strayed, is this amazing writer, and I think she said in one of her books that &#8220;You just have to show up and do the work.&#8221; Like miners don&#8217;t show up and self-doubt like, &#8220;Oh I&#8217;m not a great miner, I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m not good at this. What should I do about it?&#8221; They just show up and dig, and I just tell myself literally I have it written down. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;show up and dig.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I like that.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
It doesn&#8217;t really matter how you feel about it. Just do the work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, ultimately what would you see as success with Pearl? Let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, a couple of years down the line, what do you see as being Pearl&#8217;s biggest success?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
A few years out, I would like to have the most actionable stop for workplace or leadership questions period, or challenges period. And those two pain points that I mentioned at the start, I do think they&#8217;re inextricably linked. So very practically, I am a pretty early mid-career professional black leader in a SaaS-based business, SaaS-based startup.</p>
<p>Disproportionately the solutions that you could find on the internet that you could talk to mentors about, all of its skews towards a couple of the majority demographics. So most leaders are white, most leaders are male, most companies are enterprises. These aren&#8217;t as helpful for me with all of those attributes that I mentioned. So if I could create a platform that allows you to find the most actionable solutions by the people who have done the work and are living it, I would consider that a huge win. And speeding up time and quality of outcomes or time to task, time to delivery, quality of outcomes, but also making leaders feel like, okay, I&#8217;m not the only one struggling with this.</p>
<p>There, I can find my little pocket of other similar leaders, and also burst, look outside of my bubble to see, &#8220;Okay, for this challenge I want to know how women are solving it.&#8221; I mean there are just some challenges that certain demographics are more poised at addressing than others.</p>
<p>I mean, rewind to 2020, I don&#8217;t want necessarily to know how let&#8217;s say white folks are solving racial equity in their workplace. I think that most people were looking for what are black and brown folks&#8217; solutions to hiring, to doing or to measuring impact of my product those sorts of things similar to the Me-Too era, men didn&#8217;t have as much of a place in that. That was a woman&#8217;s conversation. So if I can do that, that&#8217;s a huge win.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, we&#8217;ve talked a lot about your work, of course we&#8217;ve learned more about Pearl, but I want to learn more about you, about Lawrence. Tell me about where you grew up?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
So I grew up and Nashville, Tennessee. And it&#8217;s funny because I&#8217;m living in two of the trendiest places in the US right now, but back when I was growing up in Nashville, I was both underaged and it was underdeveloped. So I didn&#8217;t really experience the cool Nashville that a lot of people experience today. But I moved around a lot growing up, landed in Nashville in third grade and was there through graduation, and I was pretty into STEM but didn&#8217;t really know. And I think that this is a through line of my story, I didn&#8217;t really know what I wanted to do for a long time. I had a vague idea of I wanted to create something that impacts a lot of people. And at the time it was the scientist of the time, Nicola Tesla and Leonardo DaVinci and Newton and all these people that create things that change the world.</p>
<p>And then as I went through high school, I had a vague idea of what computer science was because I watched &#8220;The Social Network&#8221; all the time and I was like, this seems dope. Just being able to create stuff from your dorm room that scales, it impacts just millions, tens, hundreds of millions of people. This is awesome. And it just all started as a series of guesses. And I had a friend that we would just dream up these big ideas and he was more the design business guy. I was the tech person. And it wasn&#8217;t until, I mean honestly late college that I realized that okay, entrepreneurship, it is possible even though the path to do that was unclear. But yeah, I think that if I had to reflect on my story, I didn&#8217;t really feel like I had a lot of clear direction for what was possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But you had that interest I guess from early on, like you said, right?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Oh yeah, I had the interest and a lot of it was gained through just guessing. And I guess media, as weird as that is, just like movies. I thought hackers were cool, I thought computer people were cool, people that built, like people in the STEM, I mean STEM always seemed like magic to me. So I was like, &#8220;This is dope.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know, I mean this might not be cool, like conventionally the cool thing to do, but it always felt really just impactful and magical.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I think that&#8217;s really interesting. You know, mentioned the movie, &#8220;The Social Network,&#8221; that was, let&#8217;s see, that came out in 2010?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Like 2010, yeah,.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
2010? So that means you were probably in elementary and middle school in the early to mid-2000s, I&#8217;m guessing?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
So let me walk it back. I was definitely in high school when The Social Network came out because I was [inaudible 00:25:55]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, you were in high school then. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, I was doing my, I think my AP Bio homework. I had &#8220;The Social Network,&#8221; on my laptop and I would just play that movie over and over again, like that one and &#8220;Inception,&#8221; I watched those movies over and over again playing them while I was doing my homework.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s interesting that you mentioned that media was also kind of a thing that motivated you about this, because when I think about a lot of the media that sort of depicted tech during that time, I can go back probably as far as say like 1999 with &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; and then &#8220;Matrix Revolution,&#8221; or I forget what the others were.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Those movies were huge.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I remember even then, that was one of the movies I was watching a ton at the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But also the world wide web really started to, I don&#8217;t want to say mature during that time, but I graduated college in 2003 and I just remember that time from 2003 three to 2010 how there were new innovations in tech and design. It felt like every week there was something new. So progress was being made in such a quick pace that whether you were in it as an actual practitioner or even on the outside of it being the beneficiary of this technology, things were just moving at such a rapid pace. I mean, you think about print magazines, print magazines from 2000 to 2010 took such a sharp decline because of the rise of desktop publishing. And people could write blogs, they could make websites, they could use content management systems. So why would they have a print magazine?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Exactly. And I feel like the people, and obviously, I was mean, I don&#8217;t want to say obviously, but I was pretty young at the time, and I feel like there were beneficiaries of people who just got to create and go very hands on, and they rode that wave of let&#8217;s say digital literacy, and just that scrappy entrepreneurship and the Wild West of the worldwide web that was a mouthful.</p>
<p>But there are people that just made a lot of money and influence and clout and learned a ton, and that compounds. And I still think that there is a lot of opportunity in tech, which is why I&#8217;m so passionate about scaling my knowledge, and especially for black and brown people, underserved people, underrepresented folks, of raising our technical literacy because, I mean this, any sort of privilege it all compounds. So yeah, I just think that that was always so cool.</p>
<p>And I kind of keep going back to magic, like &#8220;Matrix&#8221; was literally just people defying physics and cracking the code. And &#8220;Social Network&#8221; just felt larger than life of how this, these gawky kids created this social network that literally changed the world of tech and connected everyone everywhere all at once. It was crazy. And I think that that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m really passionate about, is just scaling that knowledge, like I said, because it&#8217;s magic and it&#8217;s making a lot of people a lot of money and changing the landscape in ways that are for better and worse for some people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, and I think what it also did is it, I would say not just for black and brown people, but if we look at black and brown folks specifically, also really kind of helped change the mindset of us from being consumers to creators. Because now the tools, whether it&#8217;s the personal computer, or whether it&#8217;s even just learning the languages themselves, had become so easy to access that you could do these things now that you were seeing other folks do, and there weren&#8217;t any sort of real gatekeepers to get a lot of these things done.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking back, you mentioned 2010, CNN had this, they used to do this series on CNN called &#8220;Black in America,&#8221; and they would do &#8220;Black in America Two,&#8221; Black in America Three,&#8221; Black in America, Four.&#8221; And they would be focused on different things. And they had one that was &#8220;Black in America, Four&#8221; that focused on the rise of black folks trying to get into Silicon Valley. They called it the &#8220;New Promised Land,&#8221; and&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Is that like the &#8220;If you build it, they&#8217;ll come,&#8221; mentality?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. And it was so&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:30:11] age.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It was so interesting because I was watching that and not only were these people on there that were my age, Angela Benton and Wayne Sutton, et cetera, but I personally knew these people. I had met them, I had sat down and had dinner with them, and it&#8217;s like now they&#8217;re trying to accomplish these big huge, monumental goals, now. It&#8217;s really hard to capture that feeling or to recapture that feeling I think now maybe, but certainly back then it could have been very easy to really get swept up in the feeling that you could do this too, because you also just saw people that looked like you that were doing it Exactly.</p>
<p>And the tools were available, the opportunity was there. It was just a perfect storm.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
And I feel I very much subscribed to that last point you&#8217;re on, you can&#8217;t be what you can&#8217;t see. And I think especially when I was getting started, I kind of always consider myself a little out of the loop, but I struggle to find just role models that really fit tightly to my trajectory, let&#8217;s say.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been a little too counterculture for my own good. So it&#8217;s never been sufficient for me to just necessarily cut and paste someone else&#8217;s trajectory. But even still like, okay, I want to find someone who is threading the needle between being conventionally successful in business and obviously meeting the needs of the business, while also taking this social responsibility lens, who is also a young black leader who also, it&#8217;s all of these Venn diagrams that I&#8217;ve just struggled to find, and which is why I try to be, and I definitely jump at the opportunity to be something of a role model if I can, through mentorship, through podcasts like these, just to be the person that I wish I had.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now you mentioned going to college, you went to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. What was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I think that it was, if I had to summarize it still me getting closer to what I felt like my fit was, maybe it is for a lot of people and for some people it clicks more than others. But I started in engineering, so my undergrad was in computer science and I realized pretty quickly that I didn&#8217;t feel like I fit there. Cultural reasons, and I mean demographic, I was one of the few black kids in my class, and in some cases one of the only black students in hundred-plus lecture halls, which exacerbated things a little bit.<br>
But even just the culture of it, in my opinion, the egomania of some of engineers, this wasn&#8217;t for me. And also it just didn&#8217;t feel very tactile. I didn&#8217;t feel, it all felt kind of abstract from time to time. But through that, met a lot of designers which began, light bulbs started firing, and so what that world looked like, found web development, which was the sweet spot of, okay, I can be an engineer that can think more about the user, what their needs are, what can add value for them.</p>
<p>And it was honestly through that web development, I rode that out for a while, and found the world of design through an internship at IBM, which you know in my opinion completely, I think everyone has like landmark milestones in their life. And interning at IBM was absolutely one of them, of &#8220;This is what design looks like at scale,&#8221; this is how these multidisciplinary teams collaborate.</p>
<p>It was so eye-opening, and I love the work that was being done there, and I guess I won&#8217;t say moreover, but equally loved the people from very junior to senior designers, Just all incredibly talented people, and with just huge hearts, great character. And that was around my senior year of college that I did that internship. And it was then that I was like, &#8220;Okay,&#8221; I felt like it started to click, that was the first time in my four or whatever years there that I felt like, &#8220;Okay,&#8221; this is the click that I was looking for. And I guess the three years before that where, I mean obviously I did projects here, I did a class there, but it was a lot of meandering, let&#8217;s say in hindsight until I found that click.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So after you graduated, you&#8217;d mentioned this sort of IBM internship and you stayed there for a long time. You were there for almost six years, starting off as an intern and then working your way up to becoming a strategist. When you look back at that time, what do you remember? Are there any sort of specific takeaways?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
So it can kind of be broken down into a couple chapters. So there was my early career internship, then we went through another onboarding, let&#8217;s say experience, they call them &#8220;boot camps.&#8221; That&#8217;s the one phase where it&#8217;s like starry-eyed early career, Lawrence, &#8220;the world is my oyster,&#8221; the same traps that all of these early 20 somethings succumb to. And then I was on a team for around three years. It was basically IBM design for AI, which is the intersection of design AI and basically consulting and facilitation.</p>
<p>But in essence we were creating technical, so how can non-technical teams get started with AI and create compelling, honest in the sense that this is what the technology can actually do implementation with AI. And amazing experience, and maybe one of the best ways that I could have started my career, on that team in terms of the work that I was doing.</p>
<p>And my boss at the time, extremely encouraging and just gave me a long leash. So I mean there was that chapter, and the next chapter was my tenure on the transformation team, which worked on enterprise wide transformation efforts predominantly in hybrid cloud AI and culture.</p>
<p>So the net of it was, I was doing a lot more consultative work, even on my AI team, the IBM design for AI. And that was when I realized that I just loved sitting in the middle and working in cross-disciplinary teams or multi-disciplinary teams, having high visibility projects, working with a lot of different stakeholders with big personalities. Basically translating the technical needs into layman speak into the needs of the business. And the kind of glib and story that I tell about it is I started in engineering, and then realized that designers tell engineers what to do. So I went into design and then in, or designers get told what to do by PMs and the business people. So I went into that lane. So I don&#8217;t know what you can make of that story, but that was how I decided to hop through those roles</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
From designer to engineer, I feel like that&#8217;s a journey of itself.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Engineer to designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Oh, engineer to designer.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah. And even now I feel like both are pretty misunderstood titles. I would say design a little more so than engineering, but a lot of times people think, oh, shapes, colors, make things pop as a designer, which I am not that kind of designer. It was, I mentioned my first boss, and I just think that that was a great place for me to start because he built my, I mean both, he was a design executive, so he practically sharpened my skills as a designer, but really just gave me the confidence to go into rooms with very senior people and feel like my perspective had a place there.</p>
<p>So when I think about leadership, and I&#8217;m really passionate about leadership, there was a lot to be learned from the myriad of actual leaders, like reporting chain leaders, and just some of my mentors and peers. Everyone was just so generous with their perspective. There was a lot to learn in how to lead teams.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now when you started the organization, Tech Can [Do] Better, were you still at IBM or is this after you left?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
It was at IBM. So fun fact, and I recommend this to anyone that can pull this off, I ended up taking two leaves of absence to work on, the first one was Tech Can [Do] Better and work on that full time for three months. And the second one, I took a four-month leave of absence to work on what was Pearl, and I mean we reorged right in the middle of my leave of absence, but to work on that full time. And that second leave of absence was earlier this year when we got accepted into a start-up accelerator.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh wow. So IBM was pretty, it sounds like they were pretty supportive of what you were trying to do?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. And I mean even more specifically, my managers at the time, my leadership, and I mean if you know me, I don&#8217;t, for better or for worse, I think that I&#8217;m pretty obvious with what my intentions are and what my feelings are about, I think. It&#8217;s no secret how passionate I was about this, and how much Tech Can [Do] Better and Pearl meant to me, and I explained it to my managers that I felt like this was a once in a lifetime opportunity for Tech Can [Do] Better.</p>
<p>It was maybe a month or a couple months, I&#8217;m losing track of the time after the George Floyd incident and I was like, &#8220;Okay, the attention&#8217;s waning. I only have so much time before people move on and focus on the next thing. I need to focus on this in order to capitalize in this window.&#8221; And I mean they were receptive to that. And then the second one was, like I mentioned, I got accepted to a startup accelerator and I was like, this is a once in a lifetime thing. And I mean I was like, &#8220;I need to focus on this or I won&#8217;t be able to forgive myself.&#8221; So they were supportive of that. So to their credit, IBM and especially my leaders at the time, I give them nothing but my gratitude for that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Shout out to IBM.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I know, big shout out. And it&#8217;s so easy to just be greedy with talent like that. And I realized that I think I took two leaves of absence, maybe less than a year and a half or something apart I think. So that was, they didn&#8217;t have to do that, shout out to them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has both Tech Can [Do] Better and Pearl kind of been received by the tech community? Have you gotten any sort of valuable feedback to go into either the organization or to the product?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Oh, definitely. I mean, I kind of joked that I accidentally ended up in this leadership role, because when I was starting way back, 2020, when I was starting Tech Can [Do] Better, I would&#8217;ve never predicted that I would be on here right now still talking about it by any means, I mean you always hope so.</p>
<p>But that was unprecedented for me. I&#8217;d never done anything of that scale. And I put out a proposal, I mean I asked some of my usual suspects and some of my closest friends and confidants at the time, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m doing this thing, do you want in? I really could appreciate your help.&#8221; They helped out. I kept asking more people for help. Other people were asking if I needed help, and I was like, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Months later I ended up in Fast Company not knowing how I had got here in the first place.</p>
<p>And it was just overwhelmingly positive and people saying they spun up Tech Can [Do] Better chapters of their company, they gave the proposal to their executive leadership. I mean, it was incredibly surreal for me. I mean, like I said, everything was so novel, and I keep going back to, I have to imagine a lot of that came from just how actionable it was. I get personally really frustrated with all of the noise and just the content generation machine valuing quantity over quality.</p>
<p>And I like to think that a differentiator can just be okay, this is something that takes us beyond that 20%. If I hear another takeaway that&#8217;s like &#8220;Make sure to talk to your team,&#8221; or like, &#8220;Listen, or do your education, it&#8217;s all well intentioned, but it&#8217;s just so ambiguous and doesn&#8217;t help people get started,&#8221; that I have to imagine with Tech Can [Do] Better it was a breath of fresh air because we were going one level deeper, if not like two levels deeper, which informed Pearl.</p>
<p>I mean Pearl is the tech solution that is Tech Can [Do] Better at scale. So driving actionable change from diverse leaders, helping each other get unstuck and unblocked. I mean, it&#8217;s the product that allows that matchmaking to happen. So it is those learnings that I brought even into this new org. But yeah, it&#8217;s a lot of great feedback that, I mean a lot of this has just been listening and responding and reflecting, and doing my best to take in what the signal is, and what can make the product better and more valuable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In recent years, what would you say has been the biggest lesson that you&#8217;ve learned about yourself?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Oh man, I was not expecting that question, but I will say, and I think that just off the cuff there is a very thin line between what is a strength and what is a weakness and vice versa. I think that that&#8217;s the high level what I&#8217;ve learned about myself. And even more practically, and I have friends and advisors call me out about this all the time. I am a very big picture thinker and great, a lot of times people love visionary thinkers, big picture thinkers.</p>
<p>But I am slow and I struggle to get into the details and make it very, very real, and make it maybe in another way like very small so that you can touch it. For me, it has to exist in this universal principles, the big picture, this applies to everyone sort of thing. That&#8217;s like one example, of my what I think is a strength becoming a weakness.</p>
<p>I have other ones too, but it really is such a thin line. And also it&#8217;s just reinforcing to me that in order to change anything, any external thing, it really does start with you. I mean, right now I&#8217;m leading the org. I&#8217;m the first full-time hire, let&#8217;s say, I jumped full-time. But I have to manage my own morale, my own boundaries, my own timeline, my own organization.</p>
<p>And that predicts how well I can manage all of those other things for a team of people or one other person. And let&#8217;s say if I don&#8217;t take the five minutes before the call to get my talking points, it tends to not go well when I bring in whomever I want to bring in. So everything just starts with me. And obviously, I can only control me, but I&#8217;m just front and center every single day, for how my own actions manifest and shape the outcomes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the people that have really helped you get to this point in your career? I mean, no person is an island of course, but I&#8217;m curious who your support system has been throughout all this?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
It is kind of chapter dependent, early career, the people that got me at IBM, Adam Cutler, Greg Story, Phil Gilbert, a huge, Devin O&#8217;Brien. I mean really, either they got me to go into IBM or just really hands-on mentorship, far more than they needed to be for an intern at the time. Huge people. Then just naming names like Brad Neal, one of my co-founders of Tech Can [Do] Better. I mean, honestly, a big brother, if there is one.</p>
<p>He is just such a role model in composure and equanimity. And he and I chat pretty regularly and I always love his perspective. Moses Harris, Jill Soley, one of my advisors, Suresh, Fallon, Wayne, so my advisors now. I mean by and large, I need perspective, and I don&#8217;t do well just working by myself. So even if I&#8217;m not day-to-day working with someone, I&#8217;m always bouncing ideas off of people.</p>
<p>I mean, it might be a little trite or corny to say it, but my mom is such a reliable just, I mean she is my bedrock. I go to her for both practical and emotional support. So I mean, she is just the absolute best. So I mean her as well. I mean, of all the people who are the most reliable through lines, I mean she&#8217;s it. I love her to death.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If there&#8217;s someone out there that&#8217;s listening that kind of wants to follow in your footsteps, what advice would you give them?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I would say, and I was reflecting on this recently, that it&#8217;s not too early to start. I know a lot of people say it&#8217;s not too late to start, but I would say it&#8217;s not ever too early to start. I do think that, I know that a lot of people would say, I&#8217;m young, but I still spent time feeling like I needed permission to do things or I needed the credentials or credibility or I needed something.</p>
<p>I was missing something in order to just do that thing, and I regret it. And I wish that I just had&#8230; I heard it best once, &#8220;the confidence to be imperfect and the courage to be imperfect.&#8221; And I just think that life is short. You just got to do it. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for help. Don&#8217;t be afraid of failing or looking bad. Honestly, you are, by doing your own thing and following your path, you&#8217;re doing what a lot of people don&#8217;t, and I won&#8217;t say can&#8217;t do, but are slow to do it. And just following that fire that exists inside of you and just staying true to whatever that is. So it&#8217;ll be really fulfilling, and it&#8217;ll be a hell of a rollercoaster, but I think that that&#8217;s what makes life worthwhile. If you&#8217;re 80 years old and looking back at your time here that you&#8217;re going to be happy you did that stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything that you haven&#8217;t done yet that you want to do professionally?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I mean, get Tech-, I mean now Pearl to a place where it is I mean, it&#8217;s a mainstay, it&#8217;s a household name. I mean, that&#8217;s the obvious one. I just feel like there&#8217;s a lot of impact I haven&#8217;t yet made that is just ripe for the taking. I have also, I mean on a side note, and this could be a subject of a whole other thing, I have gotten really obsessed with writing comedy, and that is basically filming a show, that is a whole other thing, we don&#8217;t have to get into it here, but I&#8217;ve always&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, let&#8217;s get into it. Let&#8217;s get into it!</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I love the idea of, I mean, just writing a show or a movie or shorts and filming it, and specifically some sort of a comedy. Maybe like Atlanta Meets Nathan For You or something like that, I love stuff like that. But I honestly have no shortage of projects. But that&#8217;s been one of the ones that I haven&#8217;t been able to shake.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, the comedy writing sounds, I like that idea. Would it be something like, I don&#8217;t know for some reason when you said that, &#8220;Abbott Elementary&#8221; immediately came to mind, but would it be some kind of workplace comedy, something like that?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I&#8217;m honestly scared. I have a show that, I mean, I might actually film and every time, I&#8217;ve shopped it to a dozen or so people and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Dude, why aren&#8217;t you making this?&#8221; I&#8217;m honestly scared to give away my game right now. But I have a show, that let&#8217;s say is the style of the show will be more like mockumentary, let&#8217;s say. So it wouldn&#8217;t be a necessarily workplace, but I have maybe the whole first season stubbed out. Definitely, I&#8217;ve talked about it with a friend just shooting the pilot, because I even think I have the pilot mostly stubbed out. It&#8217;s just a matter of doing it. I don&#8217;t know, I just I&#8217;ve always wanted to try my hand at it. I mean, I know I&#8217;m being very vague, but&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no, no, I get it. You don&#8217;t want someone listening to poach your idea. I totally get that.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I feel like I could be over-hyping it. I could be delusional, but this is such a good idea. Maybe someone&#8217;s already done it, but I need to release the pilot before I&#8217;m just out here talking about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look, that could be a good side project. You could work on that in your downtime.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, maybe these holidays when things slow down a little bit, I can get out there and just shoot a crappy pilot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There you go.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
But no, I think that that&#8217;s one of the ones, but I think that realistically, I just want to see Pearl succeed, obviously. And there are some quantitative milestones that I would love to hit. And there are some kind of qualitative things, I guess side missions, if you will, that are in support of that goal. Some of those goals that I would like to hit, I want to create a successful company, IPOs, exits or exits.</p>
<p>Obviously this is a long journey. I want to have a tool that is used by let&#8217;s say tens, hundreds, millions of people, that adds value, that changes the landscape, that spawns competitors, let&#8217;s say collaborative companies that do similar things. I just think that the land of the better collaborative software that focuses in on identity and personal context, because this matters, is pretty underexplored. And I say it&#8217;s to all of our detriment, and I&#8217;m going to see it through given this everything that I have. So to the extent that I have a life&#8217;s purpose, I feel like that&#8217;s my calling in addition to shooting the other show that I mentioned, but.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Well, this is kind of a good, I guess follow-up to that then, where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want your legacy to be?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
I see those as two different questions, but five years, I would hope to have a team and wherever Pearl evolves from this, because obviously it will evolve. I&#8217;ll use Pearl as a shorthand for the mission that I&#8217;m on now. I want to have a strong leadership team, and I mean just both be practically doing good work, but even, I&#8217;ll say equally importantly, to the work that we&#8217;re doing, the value that we&#8217;re driving through our business, be role modeling a way of better leadership.</p>
<p>So I started Pearl because I felt like it would be more impactful to demonstrate through our actions, all of the recommendations and that we were espousing through Tech Can [Do] Better, than it was just to say them and recommend them. So I want the team to just be a team of all-stars who are just devoted to demonstrating a higher degree of leadership and holding ourselves the industry to a higher standard and five years.</p>
<p>I want that to be even stronger than I&#8217;m doing it today with an awesome just all-star group of people, many of whom I&#8217;ve already collaborated with and potentially some who might be listening to this, hopefully we all find each other.<br>
My legacy, I mean, as that&#8217;s a huge question. I do hope that in line with what I was mentioning before, I very much believe in the idea of leaving things better than we found it. And what that looks like for me is I feel like I owe so much to my ancestors, mostly black ancestors, very directly in my lineage. And let&#8217;s say my cousins, aunts, the folks around me who sacrificed a lot to get me here to where I am right now.</p>
<p>And I want to contribute to that chain of progress of making it easier for black and brown folks younger than me who follow me. Making it easier for them to have the opportunities to create widescale change and showing them that it&#8217;s possible, showing them that you don&#8217;t have to conform to someone else&#8217;s trajectory to do that.</p>
<p>You have the freedom to do it the way that is right for you, basically widening what is possible for people to be conventionally successful and what that actually means. And hopefully never sacrificing, I won&#8217;t say hopefully, hopefully this is conveyed through my actions, threading that needle between doing what&#8217;s right for the business and what is just societally responsible, whatever that looks like.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about Pearl, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Yeah, so best starting place for that is our website. So pearl.us.com, and you can find all of our links there to our LinkedIn, to our Instagram, to our app itself. Everything is, that&#8217;s the best place to start for my work. If you want to follow me similarly, you can follow me at lawrencehumphrey.com, so L-A-W-R-E-N-C-E.com. Hopefully, I think this will probably, be shared out in the description, but that also has all of my links and basically anywhere websites are found, you can find those links and find everything else.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Lawrence Humphrey, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I think first of all, just thank you for sharing your story of really kind of building a company. I think it&#8217;s something that we see a lot. I think we have seen a lot over the years, just what does it look like to really step out and try to do your own thing, but I think it&#8217;s really important to also kind of build in public in a way.</p>
<p>And based off what you&#8217;ve kind of been saying, how IBM kind of allows you the time to do this, and now you&#8217;re building it out in public with advisors and such, I think that&#8217;s really important for people to see that they can achieve their own dreams in this way. And of course, what you&#8217;re doing is not only just helping you out as a founder, but also helping out the industry as a whole and hopefully helping generations of people to come, so.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Exactly, and that&#8217;s important to me for exactly the reasons I said before. I want to be really honest about this story too, that it&#8217;s fulfilling, that it&#8217;s hard. The self-doubt is to come and it&#8217;s just that more important to just keep doing it anyway. I have to imagine something. Only good things can come if you just keep doing the work and surrounding yourself with good people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Exactly. Lawrence, thank you so much for coming on the show, man. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Humphrey:</b><br>
Maurice, thank you for hosting. This was a pleasure.</p>
