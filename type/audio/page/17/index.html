Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>Every designer or artist wants to be able to make a living from their work, and this week&#8217;s guest embodies that desire. Generally, Kamar Thomas splits his time between being a design educator at two institutions &#8212; Centennial College and VCAD &#8212; but outside the classroom, he&#8217;s a prolific artist who specializes in vibrant oil paintings filled with deep meaning. He also just finished his first book, <a href="https://kamar-thomas.presale.manuscripts.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><em>The Artist&#8217;s Creative Vision</em></a>, which publishes this winter. Very nice!</p>
<p>Kamar started off talking about his teaching career, which also includes stints in the U.S. and Jamaica, and he talked about getting into art and painting as a kid before attending college at Wesleyan. He also spoke on the themes of the Black figure, masks, and abstraction in his work, his first gallery show this year, and what he ultimately wants to convey in his paintings. For Kamar, you can make art from wherever, and also have a great career!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
My name is Kamar Thomas. I am a fine art painter, primarily an artist. I&#8217;m also a professor at two colleges, Centennial College and Visual College of Art and Design. And lastly, because I have finished a manuscript, I will be an author of a book called The Artist&#8217;s Creative Vision.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Congratulations on the book.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Thank you, thank you. When it comes out, hopefully it does come out, I hope it makes an impact.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It will. I think every person&#8217;s book makes an impact, especially for the person who wrote it.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Especially for the person who wrote it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Book aside, how has the summer been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
The summer has been busy. I fill essentially three roles. I teach and I make and I write. And the summer is my season of making and writing, so I&#8217;ve had an exhibition in the summer. I&#8217;ve been going to museums quite a bit, and I&#8217;ve been just polishing up the manuscript, which is a whole long process in itself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I see on the websites you&#8217;ve got the book here available for pre-order and everything. We&#8217;ll also make sure to put a link to it in the show notes so people can check that out.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Thank you. I&#8217;m very grateful. I need it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What was your inspiration behind it?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
It came from solving my own problem, which was I was a starving artist, and I didn&#8217;t want to be a starving artist anymore so the book is written to, if I can, eradicate that concept, get rid of the idea. And to solve that problem, it&#8217;s&#8230; The real issue is how does one come up with work consistently that people want to buy? Rather than just making and following the muse and blindly following inspiration.<br>
And I sat down and I came up with a system. And by sat down, I mean with trial and error and teaching people and tried a few other method here and picking up things through teaching and applying them to myself. And the system is combine your interests with your biography, with art history, repeat. Eventually someone will buy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds pretty simple.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Sounds pretty simple, just like saving money is simple, but it&#8217;s really difficult. Just like exercise is simple, but it&#8217;s hard.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, I want to get more into your work as an artist, but let&#8217;s talk about your work as a professor first. You mentioned teaching at two universities. You&#8217;re teaching at the Visual College of Art and Design; that&#8217;s in Edmonton, Alberta. And you&#8217;re teaching at Centennial College, which is in Toronto, which is on in Ontario. That&#8217;s east coast, west coast geographically. How do you balance teaching at both of those schools?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Yeah, balance is a strong word. Let&#8217;s just say&#8230; What&#8217;s the word? Manage. Balance supplies. For a season, there is teaching Visual College of Art and Design is online, and their classes are two to three hours long. And I fit them in the schedule where I can. And I teach at Centennial in person; I&#8217;m full-time there. And that schedule is largely immutable. The meetings have to happen, the classes have to happen, and I have to physically be there. And so it&#8217;s just a matter of systematizing and being rather ruthless with what I say yes to and being very hands on with the planning. I spend a significant portion of time just planning just 20 minutes here and there. I think if I added it up over the week, it would be at least an hour and a half just on planning what I&#8217;m going to do with the time that I have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s good that you manage both of them because it sounds like one&#8217;s online, one&#8217;s in person, but then the schedules don&#8217;t seem to really cross over either, so that&#8217;s pretty good.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Yeah. If it&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned from teaching, it&#8217;s systematize. If you repeat anything, figure out the best way to repeat it rather than having to make yourself figure it out each time.<br>
I have a complicated system of things coming into my inbox to moving to a&#8230; I gather up a place, I put them in a folder, and then once a day I go in the folder, I put those into the planner ,and the the next day I get out a physical piece of paper and I write down the things from the planner. And I keep it on my person so I won&#8217;t have to keep checking the planner. And then somewhere on the paper on my person, I have somewhere to put the new stuff coming in so nothing really slips through the cracks. Some things do, but for the most part, 90%, 95% do not.<br>
The same with art; a system that you can go back to, that you can rely on to produce results is much better than inspiration-based or client-based. It&#8217;s more of if you have a method of working, you go, you consult the system. I do this. Let me check art history. What do I have inspired there? Let me draw something from my biography. Go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting, I didn&#8217;t really realize that about teaching myself until I started teaching. Which when I was in college, I would always have professors that would&#8230; They wouldn&#8217;t necessarily repeat themselves, they&#8217;d always just tell you it&#8217;s in the syllabus. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;It&#8217;s in the syllabus. I put it in the syllabus.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. Then when I started teaching, I was like, I get it, because the syllabus is like your system. You put everything in there, and it&#8217;s up to the student whether they read it or not. If they don&#8217;t read it, it&#8217;s not your fault. You put it in the syllabus. They should have read it.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Correct. It not only has everything, it has when everything is going to happen and it has how you expect it to happen and it has the consequences of if they don&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yep. And then the students get mad when they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t read the syllabus.&#8221; Well, that&#8217;s your problem. The syllabus is the key to the system for me, so I get it.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s exactly right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve been a teacher for awhile now. Not just with these two colleges, but you&#8217;ve taught in Canada, you&#8217;ve taught in Jamaica, you&#8217;ve taught in United States. What do you learn from your students? Are there any differences between students in different countries and stuff?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Yeah, there sure are. In Jamaica, the difference in students in Jamaica, I was teaching high school. And the difference really&#8230; Well, what would have made the difference there is finances, it&#8217;s money. A lot of the issues could be solved by a few dollars here and there. The main challenges I was up against was actual art materials, was the space to make the art, was the resources. Once you have the money, those problems are solved.<br>
In the United States, when I became a professor, the problem I faced the most was a problem of agency. And that I loosely define as is this thing for me? The students, a lot of them didn&#8217;t feel like making art was&#8230; Nevermind being possible, it&#8217;s possible, but just for someone else. And so a lot of my teaching was geared towards having students not only believe that it&#8217;s for them, but making projects that reinforce that belief. And there are very few things more encouraging than a few dollars in your bank account.<br>
In Canada, it is the students I teach now, it is a equivalent of a community college. And the students I teach are adults, and they want to be professionals, and they need tangible results. The difference in Canada is students are a little more responsible because they&#8217;re a little school older. But they just need the resources. They need to know when and where what&#8217;s happening. A lot of my job is just finding things for my students to enter, finding outlets for them.<br>
In Jamaica, it is a straight financial barrier. In the US, it is a problem of agency a lot of the time. And in Canada now, it&#8217;s a matter of finding and connecting the students to the resources.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I found when I talked to some educators here in the States that teach at HBCUs, it&#8217;s a combination of those things that you mentioned. If they&#8217;re teaching on HBCUs, it&#8217;s often the lack of funds and resources as well as the agency, depending on what program it is or how many people are in the department and such. It&#8217;s interesting how the problems scale based on not just country, but also just where you&#8217;re teaching and the students that you&#8217;re teaching, the type of students you&#8217;re teaching.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
That&#8217;s correct. The agency is a rather complicated problem because it&#8217;s not an individual problem. You can&#8217;t really solve it by one student, you have to get the whole class to want to do well. And as a result, the individual will do well within that, so you have to set the expectation and then you have tom in a way, make it known that what they&#8217;re doing is hard, and it&#8217;s supposed to be hard, and see if you can get them on board for the difficulty. It&#8217;s a really delicate dance. But the US, that was the problem I faced, and hopefully I rose to the challenge. And I apologize to the students if I have not.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do your students take you up on office hours?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Yes, they do. Because drawing is a bit like singing where it&#8217;s your voice, with drawing it&#8217;s your hand, it feels, and it&#8217;s your art, it&#8217;s what you are trying to say, a lot of the things that I give in class, it feels like I&#8217;m attacking them personally. They take up the office hours to tell me that I shouldn&#8217;t have attacked them personally. And then we have sessions to show them, no, it&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s understanding of the subject matter that we&#8217;re doing is not quite there yet. This is what you&#8217;re doing. You&#8217;re over here. I need you to get to here.<br>
An example of that would be I&#8217;m teaching measuring things, just measuring, and I&#8217;m I say, &#8220;You draw a line, a straight line, a perfectly vertical line and then you measure every other angle from that.&#8221; If I say picture a 90 degree angle, you have that in your head. If you cut that in half, you have a 45 degree angle. If you&#8217;re looking at a line, you can guess what that angle is because you know what 90 is and you know what 45 is. If it&#8217;s below 45, you can say, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s about 30,&#8221; et cetera.<br>
And what students do, they don&#8217;t do that, they just guess. They just put it down, it looks right, and they come to office hours and say, &#8220;Hey, you were picking on me.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;I knew you guessed because you immediately put down something before attempting&#8230; Before I even finished the sentence.&#8221; Yeah, they take up office hours, they get extra time at the beginning.<br>
Now, at the advanced level, when they&#8217;re about to graduate, they want to know if there&#8217;s a gallery showing, which ones I should contact. If there&#8217;s an art festival, how do I get in? What do I do now? I&#8217;m about to be out there. What do I do now? And I have a whole packet for them. I have what&#8217;s the steps that they take. What are the expectations? I break out the spreadsheet. Rent is $1,500. If you sell for $500, you need to sell three every month. You need to contact 10 people every month as a result. It&#8217;s 30 days in a month. If you do one every other day, you&#8217;ll get to 10; three of them might buy. And if you do this over a year, you won&#8217;t run out of money. That&#8217;s what my office hours are for.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, back when I was teaching&#8230; Oh my goodness, this might have been over 10 years ago. I started off teaching in person, and then I asked to be moved to teach online because my students were wearing me out. One, well, my students were all older than me, and so a lot of them tried to think that they would punk me because they&#8217;re like, &#8220;You&#8217;re my son&#8217;s age.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;So? I will fail you if you don&#8217;t get these assignments right.&#8221; Some of them would ask me to&#8230; They would bring their kids to class and they would try to use office hours as babysitting. They would have their kid come to office hours. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Where&#8217;s your mom?&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; What am I supposed to do? I&#8217;m not running daycare over here. And I asked to be moved online because I was like, I can&#8217;t keep coming out here and fooling what y&#8217;all doing this stuff.<br>
And online is just different because the students just have to have more discipline. And again, this was 10 years ago, pre-pandemic. Now where I think everyone&#8217;s used to doing virtual work. Just trying to get them to have the discipline to just say something in the forum, just participate in class. Because there was a participation element to their grade. And then when they have office hours, it&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Well what can I do to make up for the time that I wasn&#8217;t speaking?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You can&#8217;t. You can&#8217;t make up participation. There&#8217;s no extra credit for participation. You didn&#8217;t speak up. That was it.&#8221; Trying to do anything they could just to pass. I would have students that would try to justify why they thought it was okay cheating because the class was online. And if the class wasn&#8217;t online and Wikipedia wasn&#8217;t there, then why would it be available as a resource? They&#8217;re very creative.<br>
I was teaching a&#8230; It was basically principles of web development to business students, which was probably why they were so duplicitous, because it wasn&#8217;t design students, they were business majors that just needed a credit. They didn&#8217;t really care to learn, they were just like, &#8220;What can I do to get past you?&#8221; Essentially. And it would be just so disheartening because I would have students that would fail my class two and three times coming back doing the same stuff, and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Do you want me to just pass you out of pity? Because it&#8217;s getting there. It&#8217;s hurting me to see you doing the same stuff. The assignment has not changed from semester to semester. I would think you would be better at it because you&#8217;ve done it before.&#8221; Yeah,. I do miss teaching though, I just don&#8217;t miss all of that, I don&#8217;t miss all of that.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Some people you&#8217;re not going to get when you are in&#8230; What is it? The lower school levels of everybody, and everybody&#8217;s decent. But as soon as you go to high school and you&#8217;re high school as 2,000 people, you know at least one or two crazy people, just absolute&#8230; You see them, you cross the street.<br>
In teaching, some people it might be they might not make it. It might be that they, for whatever reason, their motivation, they&#8217;re unwilling to do the work; and that&#8217;s fine. I do my absolute best to not take it in any way personal. I actually take it as a point of pride to produce the same professionalism, no matter what the student comes with. And I treat them extra, extra nice just to make the D or the E that they&#8217;re about to get a bit more palatable. But I&#8217;m-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wait, did you say D or E?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Listen, there&#8217;s no time machine. You&#8217;re going to fail this class. It&#8217;s over for you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wait, wait. There&#8217;s a grade that&#8217;s a E?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a F.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
It exists, but I explain in great detail, the grades that are coming, and I explain the connection. And I try and point out what they can do next time, provided and they take it again. And I make it really long, and it takes a long time for me to do it. When they come back the next time I say, &#8220;Remember that long list I sent you? You haven&#8217;t done it. You showed up when there was three weeks remaining in the semester and you were asking me to perform a miracle, but I am merely a teacher. I am not the Lord. I cannot turn the water into wine. I&#8217;m sorry, I can&#8217;t make time return itself.&#8221; If you plan on making it, you have to come to a certain number of them to get participation. A lot of it is merely giving people the benefit of the doubt that they&#8217;ll try again and not taking it personally. And I&#8217;m going to be honest; it&#8217;s been really difficult.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can imagine. I can imagine.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
It&#8217;s very, very difficult. But again, systematize. I&#8217;ve seen it before now. I&#8217;m actually mad if it bothers me at all when I see the second time. I always think you&#8217;ve seen this before. You really [inaudible 00:21:30]. You see it&#8217;s not the first person that has come in three weeks before. Go look for the three weeks before folder, search to your computer. Oh, here it is. Oh yeah, this is what I said. Got it. And then I go and set out the template.<br>
And that way, again, because in the US, agency was the problem, I always wanted to preserve the idea that this person felt like what I was teaching was theirs. And so I would try and be excruciatingly kind, the kind of understanding, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re still going to fail, but it&#8217;s an understanding fail.&#8221; It&#8217;s with love, it&#8217;s with kindness, it&#8217;s with accountability. And I think if the students have changed me in any way, I&#8217;ve become way more understanding and way more empathetic. Still going to failure you, though, but way more empathetic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I get it. Sometimes I know students are going through a lot, and you try to do as much as you can. You want to get them to the level where they hopefully are understanding and doing it for themselves, and then sometimes you just don&#8217;t have that. But I think as educators, you and I both realize that it comes with the territory.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Unfortunately, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit and talk more about you. I think, as folks can probably tell by now with the quiet storm voice, that you&#8217;re from Jamaica. Tell me what it was like growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
I&#8217;m from port Antonio in Jamaica. Place called Boundbrook, which is near the town of Port Antonio. Yeah, it&#8217;s called Stony Hill. As the name suggests there are stones. It&#8217;s a hill in areas. Not forest. There are trees, lots of them. There are dogs wandering on your properties. That&#8217;s your dog now. My neighbors knew all of my business. It&#8217;s a small place and it&#8217;s&#8230;<br>
My parents, man, they did a great job. They did what they were supposed to do. And as a result, I felt like I could&#8230; Not only was I supposed to do well in school, but it was like, yeah, when I pass any exams and I come home with some a good report, all right, that&#8217;s nice, but we were expecting this. And that environment, I think, is what I credit for my trying so hard at anything.<br>
Growing up there, our national heroes are all Black people. Every teacher I ever had was a woman. The prime minister was a woman at the time. When I came to the US and the term African American or Black had anything negative attached to it, I was very, very surprised, to say the least, because we don&#8217;t really have any negative connotations towards a Black identity in Jamaica at all when I was growing up. Things may have changed. But when I was growing up, we didn&#8217;t.<br>
I come to the US and, oh. In Jamaica, you&#8217;re a man, and you come to the US, you&#8217;re a Black man. What does that mean? And my work is a direct result of trying to answer that question exactly. What does that mean exactly? And the answer for me was to expand what I think Black identity is, to expand what identity is in general. And to do that, I make a whole bunch of paintings that refer to my identity on the one hand, but also does so in a more abstract way. I make a whole bunch of paintings that are abstract, but they&#8217;re real, and I&#8217;m trying to say identity is abstract and also real.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you first get into art and painting?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Ah, so that is a really good question. In Jamaica, we have, when we leave school, they&#8217;re called Caribbean examination council exams. Everything is exam-based. And I took art in these exams, and I got just a little bit below the best, so I was into art in high school.<br>
As a profession, absolutely not. That&#8217;s not in the tables. That&#8217;s not a thing. It was at my university I met my painting professor; her name was Tula Telfair. She was born Capon. She had long hair. She wore Prada dresses. I don&#8217;t know if it was Prada dresses, I just know these dresses were expensive. And she got oil paint on them and it didn&#8217;t bother her. And she drove an Audi, a blue one that sounded like a hair dryer. And she could paint quite a bit.<br>
 And I was thinking to myself, I understand being a professor pays, but you&#8217;re not buying an Audi from professor money. And I actually asked her, I got up courage, &#8220;Hey man, how you sell these paintings? How does this work?&#8221; And she&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, you have to get very, very good and go take the classes you need. And we can talk about it when you get into the class.&#8221; And I did. I took the classes that was needed. And while I was painting with her, she just treated me and all the other students as if we were already professionals.<br>
Now, to many people, she was mean, but it&#8217;s a very specific thing where she wants you to be ready. As soon as you step out, she wants you to be already ready. And so she would come into this studio and say if she were a curator and she gave me a show, she&#8217;d take it back immediately. I need to be painting way more than this, and then just leave me to contemplate what she just said. She would come in and just really treat me like an equal, to be honest, treat me like, &#8220;Look, when you graduate, nobody going to know what this is. This is not fun and games. You really need to be making the work consistently and professionally.&#8221; And somewhere along the line, it just happened that I felt like I was a professional. It was very gradual, but a few well placed curse words got it into my head that one should be a professional, treat it you would like any other job. It was really in college.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s get back more into you, into your background. Was your family really supportive of you getting into art?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
That is such an interesting question. Supportive is a strong, strong word. My father is an EMT, and before that he was a fireman. He&#8217;s out here saving lives. My mom was the secretary to the dean of a college in Jamaica. This serious working people. And they send their son to America definitely not to paint, definitely not.<br>
I&#8217;m there. Initially, I was doing physics, and it went okay, but I decided, okay, if I attack the painting with the same consistency I was doing physics, I might be able to make it work. And I, behind their back, just major in art. Don&#8217;t tell nobody. Get down to business. And it&#8217;s time to graduate now. And I call them up and I go, &#8220;Hey, the graduation is nice, but it&#8217;s me and 700 people. Nobody cares. Why don&#8217;t you come to this thing I&#8217;m having called an exhibition?&#8221; And they came and I made some sales, but I told the people, &#8220;Could you wait and give me the money in the exhibition so that my parents could see that I&#8217;m out here making it?&#8221; And they did. And they&#8217;ve been supportive ever since.<br>
They&#8217;ve been supportive of me as a person, but because I hid it initially from them, as an artist, after I graduated, they were on board. And they have the ordinary fears. All parents are afraid that their children will perpetually depend on them until they&#8217;re 60. Parents live like, &#8220;When are you going to grow up?&#8221; And once I demonstrated that I got this, I&#8217;m fine, then they were very happy. Then it was like, all right, relax, mom. You don&#8217;t have to tell this lady that&#8217;s doing your nails. Then it&#8217;s a matter of holding them back right.<br>
But before that, if you&#8217;re an artist listening, your parents are afraid you are going to be broke. Avoid it at all costs and you will be supported. And then you&#8217;ll have the problem of having them&#8230; Telling them to relax on the support a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What made you decide to go to Wesleyan for school?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Yeah, so I got into medical school in Jamaica. Got into the University of the West Indies. I&#8217;m 17 years old applying to things, my dad&#8217;s an EMT I saw those medical books. And my dad has been going on, ambulances, picking people up, so I was barely familiar with what medicine actually means. And I thought to myself at 17 years old, nah, can&#8217;t do that.<br>
And I was in this program for&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say gifted. It was the Association of Quietly Excellent Scholars and Thinkers, AQUEST was the name of it. Just a group of people who met. And they said, &#8220;Apply to some colleges in the US. They give scholarships.&#8221; And I applied to a few and a few said yes. And I picked Wesleyan because it gave the most.<br>
I went blindly with not very much information. These are the days of, of course, paper applications and paying for internet at internet cafes for half an hour at a time. The kinds of research that people do today, not possible. The virtual tours and the flying in and doing it, that&#8217;s not a thing. It&#8217;s you see a name, all right, it&#8217;s in Connecticut. How much of a flight is that? Okay. All right, apply, see what happens. And what happened was they called me and said, &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;ve been accepted.&#8221; And I go, &#8220;Great. What does that mean?&#8221; &#8220;It means you&#8217;re going to get a visa and come and you live here before.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, all right.&#8221; It was more of I need to get an education, and medicine at 17, at 18 is rough. That choice was too difficult, so let me go to a liberal arts school and figure out another path.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And what was that path? Of course, it was art, but tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Initially, it was physics. In general, I really like excellence of any kind, but I really was into all of the great physicists, Faraday and Einstein and Niels Bohr. I read these people&#8217;s biography. I loved the mathematician, Riemann&#8217;s hypothesis. I was reading that. I was just in the library reading up about people, with their mind, with their head, they were doing things. And that kind of a thing was impressive to me because I&#8217;m nearsighted so physical feats, they were impressive, but they were hard. I wasn&#8217;t going to catch anybody. Got glasses and sorted that out. But what really wowed me was sitting into the library and reading. Wait a minute, this guy, Newton, came up with the theory of gravity and figure out white light is made up of all the other colors and invented calculus, and then he turned 26. Whatever he&#8217;s doing, I need to have some of this. These people were what were impressive people to me.<br>
And then I went to college and I found out what professional physics was, which is you write some code and you run a model and then you refine the code and then you run the model. If you are a professor and you&#8217;re at the end, if you can manage a tenure position, you have a grad student write parts of the code and run the model. It&#8217;s not this romantic notion of sitting down and solving the kinds of universal questions I was hoping for. It was more of can you learn to code? And can you learn the math? And can you learn the math to tell it to code?<br>
And so I figured that out around my second year when it was time to decide a major. And I was doing some drawing and I said, &#8220;If I actually flipped a coin, flipped it, heads, I stay with physics, tails, I go with arts.&#8221; It was tails. I then went, &#8220;This can&#8217;t be real,&#8221; so I went online and I took a random question answer generator, and it ended up with art as well. I said, &#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll go with art.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
That&#8217;s what it was. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You just left it up to chance, huh?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Left it up. Because again, I figured&#8230; Let me put it in perspective.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
There was a guy in my classroom, his name is Zin Lin. He was from Burma. He skipped both levels of calculus, and multi-variable calculus, and was the TA of the physics class while he was taking it. And there was fives Zin Lins in my class of 20 people. And there are people who they&#8217;ve been doing physics so long, they are as good at physics as Mozart is as good at music. These people are good, good. You&#8217;re not going to catch them in your lifetime.<br>
And I was working an extreme amount just to&#8230; I would get 92%, and that would be a B because somebody got 108% and the A was moved up to 108%. It&#8217;s this kind of environment where the effort I&#8217;m putting in, I&#8217;m thinking if I apply this work ethic to basket weaving, I&#8217;m going to have some amazing baskets.<br>
And again, I was already doing&#8230; It&#8217;s not a random pick, it was something that I was already doing. I was taking languages, and I&#8217;m doing art at the same time, art and art history all at the same time. And I figure if I threw myself at this art the way I&#8217;m doing at physics, I&#8217;m going to be all right, I&#8217;m going to be cool. And that&#8217;s why I was comfortable leading up to chance. For those listening, that&#8217;s not wise. Don&#8217;t do that. Don&#8217;t do that. If you already have an arena of proven work ethic, go for it. But if not, then put some more thought.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re attending Wesleyan, you&#8217;re majoring in art, and you graduated. After you graduated, you ended up going back to Jamaica for a while, and then you ended up coming back to the States. Tell me about that time.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
I graduated, and I just couldn&#8217;t come up with the money to move to New York so I stayed near that the school and worked at a little supermarket, sold paintings and again realized&#8230; really figured out that I don&#8217;t have a gallery, I don&#8217;t have a curator backing me. I have no critics looking at my work. I&#8217;m just a guy out here, but I need to eat. And so I would, for jobs that I was applying to that were arts related, I would send them what I was working on and just let them know that I painted as well and let them know what it was about very quickly. And many of them would respond, and I wouldn&#8217;t get the job, but they&#8217;d buy a painting or they&#8217;d refer me to somebody else, and they would buy a painting. I figured out pretty early, if you tell people, they will buy.<br>
Then, of course, my visa expired and I had return to Jamaica where I was hired as an art teacher at my old high school. Taught 8, 9, 10th, and 11th grade. And then after that, while I&#8217;m in art school, I&#8217;m doing the same thing I did, just whenever I had to email somebody or whenever I met someone and I took their number, I just told them that I painted. And it worked the same way in the US, it worked in Jamaica. Somebody was like, &#8220;You paint. I never met an artist before.&#8221; Said, &#8220;Well, now you have. Would you send them what I&#8217;ve done?&#8221; And I sold paintings. And people would pay me in installments, so they&#8217;d pay a little this week and then another bit next week in Jamaica, and that allowed me to save up the money to apply to graduate school. Came to graduate school, did pretty much the same thing. And I&#8217;ve been doing it since.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, it seems like you always had your eye on the prize when it comes to that, which is good. Even though you were doing other things like teaching and stuff, you still were telling yourself and other people, &#8220;I am an artist.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Yes. I think around half of the battle is just showing up and making the work and committing to telling people. Around half, which seems like an exceptionally large percent but the thing is, if you continually tell people, you are going to need to show them something that you&#8217;ve told them about, which is going to make you want to continue to paint. And the more you paint, the more you want to tell people, and it starts this virtuous cycle of making something, talking about it. And the more you talk about it, the more you make, the more you make, the more you talk about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s also just keeping that dream in the forefront. It&#8217;s not about having whatever the weight of reality or the weight of the world kill that idea for you. You still had it in the front of your mind, I am an artist, I am an artist. You&#8217;re telling people, you&#8217;re doing it. I think that&#8217;s just a powerful thing for people to keep in mind as they go through whatever it is they&#8217;re going through as part of their creative journey; keep the dream at the forefront and keep striving towards that.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
I was raised as a rather religious person, and in the church, they have daily bread. They have daily readings, daily Bible texts. And as a young child, this is bothersome. This is a problem. You&#8217;re up every day? kind of a thing. And I applied that same concept to my artwork, which is the daily reminders and daily things and daily&#8230; not affirmations, but something entirely dedicated to reminding me that I can probably be better but also looking back at what I&#8217;ve already done to give myself the permission to just do a little bit more. All around my house, I have all kinds of&#8230; Well, I have paintings that I&#8217;ve made, so I see them every day.<br>
But I also have whiteboards here and there. And I&#8217;ll write a quote that I want to keep repeating. And one of them, the most recent one I have written is better to light a candle than curse the darkness. I didn&#8217;t realize that that&#8217;s where that came from until you asked me that question, but it&#8217;s the idea that you have to do something every day to remind, to get yourself to do it so that inevitably when you don&#8217;t feel like doing it, you&#8217;ve had 47 days of reminding yourself of the importance and looking back at what you&#8217;ve done so much, for how much you&#8217;ve done so far. And you eventually will just keep making stuff just because you&#8217;re in the habit of reminding yourself.<br>
The same with exercise. I haven&#8217;t really missed a workout in years. And when I have to miss one, I feel it because when I get up, I exercise. I don&#8217;t even think about it. I get up, I exercise, them&#8217;s the rules. The same, I get up, I exercise, and before I leave, I have to see this thing that I wrote down with my hand. I&#8217;m surrounded by paintings that I like, so it&#8217;s a constant reminder. I think that&#8217;s really key when you&#8217;re pursuing something that is a creative risk, to constantly and regularly remind yourself and encourage yourself because outside is not going to do it. There is no reassurance coming. You have to provide it for yourself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s get more into your particular art style and your process. Based on what I can see from your website, I feel like after you came back to the States from Jamaica, this is when you really started to come into your own as an artist, not just in words, but in deeds as well by the actual paintings that you&#8217;ve created. Tell me about your process. What inspires you to make the art that you do in this fashion?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Yeah, so the main inspiration was the difference of being a Black man from Jamaica to the US and trying to work out what identity means and trying to make something that says it&#8217;s a little bit more complicated than you think. And what changed in graduate school was I more clearly could articulate what the art was supposed to do and I could use better metaphors. I could talk about it better is really what changed. And talking about it better is a function of thinking about it better and more clearly.<br>
The change I want to make was I want someone to look at whatever identity they occupy as something that&#8217;s within their control. That sentence took two years of making artwork that I didn&#8217;t like to figure out. It took two years of trial and error and critiques in graduate school.<br>
And once you have a clear direction, then I choose from the tools that are available to me. Oil paint I can paint really realistically or I can paint really abstractly or I can use technology to manipulate how an audience interacts with that artwork. And I make series of paintings that are somewhere between really abstract or close to realistic to walk people painting by painting through the idea that your identity can also be&#8230; Sure, it can be tangible, it can be reifined, it can be reaffirmed, but it&#8217;s also changeable by you. What changed in graduate school was I refined the message a lot more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now you have a connection with one of our other guests on the show, Bennie F. Johnson. He&#8217;s the executive director currently of AIGA. How did you two connect?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
After I graduated but before I graduated, a parent of one of the students graduating was walking by the cafeteria, and they had some paintings of mine in there. And she Googled me and contacted me and said, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m in the art business. I&#8217;d like to have a conversation.&#8221; And we had that conversation. And she introduced me to Bennie. And we went down to DC and I painted Bennie and his wife and hung out with his kids. Wow, those kids must be grown by now that I&#8217;m thinking about it, probably. He was really little boy and really little girl, but now they must be big.<br>
Yeah. I made two paintings of him and his wife. And I actually painted their face with face paint with the kids. But the kids are just rough with the face paint while stabbing daddy with the paint brush. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You have to be gentle. Just paint a little bit at a time.&#8221; And just attacking his face. And same, his wife Akira, I believe is her name, [inaudible 00:46:26], painted her as well I painted them both. I painted a pair of paintings, and I delivered it. And I believe it&#8217;s still in their home to this day. It was a lovely experience, and I thanked them for trusting me to do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
He texted me the photos. They&#8217;re really something. I know the photos don&#8217;t do justice to your work, but they&#8217;re really striking</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Again, remember I&#8217;m from Jamaica, I&#8217;m from this hill in Jamaica.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Stone Hill.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Yeah, Stony Hill. Washington, DC may as well be Mars. It may as well be a different planet. This is a place where people work in the government and people talk about the Capitol. And people are like, the president&#8217;s going to be&#8230; White House down there, and this is an Anacostia. And this is professional. He&#8217;s driving around and telling me about all this, and my world is expanding. And I thank him quite a lot for that, just telling me about the history of the place and the residents that were there and the kinds of just work that people do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Actually, Bennie wanted me to ask you a question. When I talked with him, I told him I was interviewing you. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh yeah,&#8221; and he texted me the photos. Bennie wanted me to ask you about how you use the Black figure and abstraction in your work.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Yes. When I came to college in 2008, around &#8217;08, &#8217;09-ish was when occupy Wall Street happened. And it was activisty, activist town, activist everything. I arrived in the United States in 2014. And if I remember correctly, that was when one of the first big public police shootings happened. It was just bam, I stepped out of the airport, and then the shooting happened. It was on TV. And it was very much in the air, the making of work that was overtly describing the Black experience as well as it is lived by many in the United States. And I said to myself, &#8220;They don&#8217;t need anymore negative portrayals of Black people.&#8221; I understand, I get it fully what&#8217;s happening, but I think&#8230; What&#8217;s his name? Do you know the book Between the World and Me?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm, Ta-Nehisi Coates. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Ta-Nehisi Coates. Yeah. If I&#8217;m a writer, he got it. He nailed it. He got it. I don&#8217;t need to write another one like that. I think he has it. I said the same with my paintings. I think when I look through what&#8217;s being made right now, I think they got it. I don&#8217;t think if I say something, it will be nearly as impactful as if I really focus on this idea of agency, of mutability, of aspiration. And I think now more than ever is when it&#8217;s needed.<br>
Never say never, but for the most part, I look at the Black figure&#8230; I want, when I&#8217;m an old man and my memory&#8217;s going in the art history books, they see images of representation that are complex, that are layered, that are nuanced, that are not only in relationship to whiteness, that are exploring the same way every other artist gets to explore. And so that&#8217;s how I use the Black figure. Complicated. Take its place, like everybody else.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Masks are a regular theme in a lot of your work. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Yeah. Masks are a metaphor that I return to. And masks in the Caribbean&#8230; In Toronto, they recently had this big carnival called Caribana. It&#8217;s where one gets to put on a mask and put on a costume and go outside and essentially simulate sex through dancing, essentially, to a beat. And that&#8217;s only acceptable if you&#8217;re wearing this costume. You can&#8217;t just do this at your day job. You can&#8217;t pull up to accounts receivable and start doing this behavior.<br>
And I use and I think about masks in that way. It allows you to occupy an identity that gives you privileges, that gives you the ability to act in a way that you ordinarily wouldn&#8217;t. And you don&#8217;t have to keep it forever. You can change it. And so masks, as a notion of identity is look, of course you are who you are, you&#8217;re born or you&#8217;re born, but if, when it comes to making art, if you view all of it as yours and like you&#8217;re supposed to be there, suddenly where you take influence from is much wider. If you view that the creative production is for you, then telling people about it is not that big a deal. If you think that you are supposed to be passing this class, that your identity is, yeah, pass classes. Then chances are, you&#8217;re going to work to pass that class.<br>
Masks are this wonderful metaphor that I keep going back to, I keep finding nuances. Mask can conceal things. You can put it on, you can rob somebody, you can get away with it. Masks can review things. You can wear a mask for ritual purposes to act in ways to enter into states like trances, to enter into states, well, at carnival, et cetera. And masks, with the pandemic, went from being something to protect other people from getting infected with COVID to protecting yourself, to being a status symbol, to&#8230; The meaning of it changed over time, so I&#8217;ve been fascinated by this concept of masks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you talked earlier about this exhibition that you had recently. How did it go? Tell me about it.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
It went okay. What I did was I rented a gallery and just paid them the rent for a week and told as many people as I could about it. And people came and purchased the work. It was undertaking because when you pay for the gallery, you have to do everything. You have to show up and hang the work and sweep out the gallery and paint the wall and nail in the painting onto the wall and set up the lights. But from a introducing Toronto to my work perspective, it went swimmingly because one does it. I can show you better than I can tell you. It was a matter of inviting people. Many of them were new to Toronto. And I sell my art mostly to people who have never really bought art before, so it was a great success in that way. I got many, many people who didn&#8217;t even think of themselves as people who buy artwork to buy art and to think about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s awesome, that&#8217;s awesome. I&#8217;m glad that it was really successful for you in that way.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Thank you, thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are you planning on doing another exhibition this year? Or surely in the future, you&#8217;re planning on doing something.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
In the future, yes. My time for the next couple months is taken up with the book and with&#8230; I&#8217;m going to be the coordinator of the program I&#8217;m teaching at Centennial, so it&#8217;s a lot of emails and a lot of tours and a lot of interviews, et cetera is coming up.<br>
But next year I&#8217;m planning to&#8230; I&#8217;ll be painting the whole time. Next year, I have anywhere from five to 10 exhibitions that I&#8217;m putting into the calendar. But I&#8217;m going to be producing the work to get that done now next year, 2023, by January, the book will be out. By March, I&#8217;ll have at least one exhibition. By June, I&#8217;ll have another. By July, I&#8217;ll have another. By August, I&#8217;ll have another. And if my papers are right, I might have one or two in Jamaica as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, you got a plan. That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Yeah, I have a plan, but saying man makes plans, God laughs, because COVID really.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, well, that&#8217;s true, that&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Here there&#8217;s a whole monkeypox coming on the scene.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
We can&#8217;t get a break in this century.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is it that you ultimately want to convey with your work?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Yeah. Ultimately, I want people to see art as something that is for everybody. And I want them to see it as a decent job. Now, will you get rich doing it? Probably not. That being said, will you get rich doing anything? Probably not. It&#8217;s not more difficult than anything else.<br>
I want people with looking at my work to understand and think through their identity as something that they get to pick. I want to overall increase agency in the world. Increase not just confidence, but the idea of possibility.<br>
My largest challenge is getting students to not just believe that they can do what I&#8217;m asking, but that they&#8217;re supposed to do what I&#8217;m asking, and they&#8217;re supposed to do it well. If you look at identity, there is&#8230; I think Ben Akerlof, he&#8217;s an economist, and he says identity is one of the most significant economic decisions that someone can make. That means when you pick your identity, you pick what clothes you&#8217;re going to buy, you pick what shoes you wear, what colleges you can get into, what person you can marry, what neighborhood you&#8217;re going to live. And I want people, after having consumed my work, see the significance of those decisions and see that they have much more agency over them. They have way more power.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at your younger self, let&#8217;s say your 16 year old self, when you look back at him, what advice would you give him?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Oh man, that&#8217;s such a really good question. At 16 years old, I was honestly not listening to nobody. You weren&#8217;t going to tell me I&#8217;m not going to be pretty good at physics. You weren&#8217;t going to tell me I&#8217;m not going to be pretty good at anything.<br>
At 16 years old, well, I would actually say go to the dance, is what I would say. When I was in college, they had these things called winter dances. And I was a member of the ASA, African Student Association, and they had a dance. And every year they would ask me, &#8220;Just come practice for the dance and do it on the night.&#8221; And I would go, &#8220;No, I have to paint. I have this problem set to do.&#8221; And I never did the dance, never did the dances because, again, your undergraduate was so hard I never did them.<br>
And it was in graduate school I realized how much I missed by not doing the dance, how much outside of class relationships I could have formed if I did the dance, if I just went through the thing and practiced and maybe gotten 98% instead of 100%. You still get an A. I realized at that time, because when I started selling paintings, I realized the need and the importance of human relationships. That&#8217;s most of life. Life is group work, is what life is.<br>
I would tell my 16 year old self, A, just go to the dance. Sure, be focused, but you don&#8217;t have to be all that focused. Go to the dance. You will have a good time. You&#8217;ll form human connections. And when they need help, you&#8217;re going to be able to help them. And when you need help, they&#8217;re going to be able to help you. But go to the dance is what I would say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At this stage of where you&#8217;re at in your career as a painter, as an educator, now as an author, how do you define success?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Yes. I was talking to someone earlier about this concept. I woke up when I was 26 years old and I realized that I had all that I wanted. I wanted to be a painter, and that&#8217;s what I did most of the time, most of my days. I applied for a professor job, and I was working as a professor at 26.<br>
Success for me was spending my time doing and utilizing God&#8217;s gifts as they have been bestowed to me. And I can learn pretty quickly and I can teach fairly well and I can paint, and I do all of these with most of my time. Success is doing or using the gifts that you have for most of your time. Doesn&#8217;t have to be all the time now. We all have to pay taxes and commute to work; most of the time. And for me, I have all I want.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Given that, and you&#8217;ve sort of, I guess, already teased this out a little bit, but where do you see yourself in the next five years? What work do you want to be doing? Any bigger projects or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Whenever I run into any new medium, I try and figure it out and do a project in that medium. Now I&#8217;m looking into AR, so Instagram filters and Snapchat filters, provided Snapchat still alive as a company. Those are the kinds of AR that everyone would be familiar with. Augmented reality is what AR stands for. And I&#8217;m thinking that this can be a really strong addition to my work. And I&#8217;m thinking if I can figure this out, if I can learn that small bit of code&#8230; I&#8217;m taking a class here and there. In four or five years, I will have two, three projects tying technology and the art that I&#8217;m doing.<br>
When I moved in Quebec, all of my friends were concept artists, and they worked in the entertainment industry designing monsters and trying to tell stories. And a part of my job now as a professor is I found myself helping people become illustrators and helping them learn to design those monsters. And as such, I&#8217;m looking at them watching much more stories, so there might be some short films in the mix. There might be some form of narrative in the mix.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
You can find me at kamarthomas.com, or you can find me on Instagram at O-H-K-A-M-A-R. As mentioned earlier, I was a flowery languaged young man, and I got the sentence, &#8220;Oh, Kamar,&#8221; quite a bit so I made that my Instagram handle. And you can find me at those two places primarily, or if you type my name, Kamar Thomas, into Google, I am proud to say you will find me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Kamar Thomas, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. One, I think just like your energy, you really just come across as very self-assured and cool as well as artistic. But I think also just telling your story of coming from Jamaica and always putting your artwork and the work that you&#8217;re doing and who you are as an artist at the forefront as you&#8217;ve went through life I think, one, it&#8217;s granted you the success that you have now, but I think it&#8217;s just a really great example to set for others out there that can hopefully do the same thing. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Kamar Thomas:</b><br>
Perfect. Thank you. Thank you so much. It was a privilege and an honor.</p>

<p>I became familiar with Gusto several months ago through my last gig, and I was so pleased with the user experience that I had to find out who some of the folks were behind it. And wouldn&#8217;t you know it &#8212; one of them happens to be <a href="https://28daysoftheweb.com/2015/jeff-jeanbaptiste/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">a former 28 Days of the Web honoree</a>. Meet Jeff Jean-Baptiste!</p>
<p>After a quick check-in to see how things are going, Jeff talked about his role as a product designer and gave some info on his behind-the-scenes design work at the company. From there, Jeff shared his origin story of growing up in Miami, how anime became his gateway to art, and talked about his interest in architecture and how that drives his current design focus. He even gave some insight into the Orlando design community and talked about finding success at this point his career. </p>
<p>For Jeff &#8212; and for all of us, really &#8212; anything worth having is worth working hard towards. So get out there and make it happen!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do?</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Hey, so my name is Jeff Jean-Baptiste, a designer focused on just building great thoughtfully crafted experiences for people, just software that works.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2022 been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Oh man, 2022 has been actually pretty amazing. I mean the backdrop of a lot of things happening in the world for me personally, is worked out pretty well, both professionally and in my personal life, my wife and I, we closed on a house so that&#8217;s going to be our first home, so that should be done in a couple months.<br>
So that&#8217;s pretty exciting and, yeah, work it&#8217;s been pretty magical. Just the things that I&#8217;m doing is pretty exciting. I&#8217;m still very much so happy at my current role, and we&#8217;re doing a lot of great things that I&#8217;m looking forward to building on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So what is it that you want to try to accomplish for the rest of the year? Do you have any sort of plans that you set forth at the beginning of the year that you want to try to do?</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ll talk about the two things. One on the professional side, I would say one thing I&#8217;m trying to get better at is becoming a better storyteller and I can get into more of that later as well. But yeah, that&#8217;s one thing, it&#8217;s a part of my goal is just can be able to tell a more cohesive and better story about when you&#8217;re designing products.<br>
There&#8217;s always this the customer aspect and the pain that you&#8217;re highlighting and how you&#8217;re the things you&#8217;re designing, how it solves their pain. So I believe that&#8217;s one of the best ways people communicate and I&#8217;m a big, big movie buff. So I love stories. I&#8217;ve also started to read a lot lately and it&#8217;s just the way that stories are told. I feel like it&#8217;s an awesome communication method and I want to get better at that.<br>
And first personally, in my life, I mentioned earlier where we&#8217;re close on the house, so that should be happening soon. So yeah, just ready for that whole process to be done and then going to be booking some time to relax. So we&#8217;ll be going on a cruise in a couple months and just out in the open sea. And that should be cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Take it now before the next global health scare happens, if you can try to squeeze it in there, I&#8217;m curious about this storytelling. Are there certain resources or things that you&#8217;re looking at to try to help increase your storytelling skills?</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
I haven&#8217;t looked at anything specifically. I just follow certain folks that I think are great story to. There&#8217;s a lot of people at my Gusto that are really great at this, and I&#8217;m actually being mentored right now by somebody internally in product who&#8217;s just trying to build that muscle a little bit more. And then, yeah, I think I&#8217;ve taken some cues from folks internally and then as well as I think Twitter is a great place for resources.<br>
If you follow the right folks, there&#8217;s a lot of good nuggets of information there, but just trying to hone that skill a little bit more just through actually doing it myself. That&#8217;s I think is the biggest part of it is as I&#8217;m presenting design work, I&#8217;m really cognizant of how I am delivering that message and trying to communicate. So I&#8217;m actively doing that work as well as taking in some of his other external information as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about your work at Gusto. You&#8217;re a product designer there and you started last year. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. It&#8217;s almost been a year now. So in September I started. Yeah. So I started last year. Yeah. I&#8217;m going to working on a zero to one team and basically just a part of Gusto that doesn&#8217;t exist yet, which is specifically around HR tools and we&#8217;re building things like performance management and also some other things around HR tooling for customers to help develop and retain their talent at their organizations, which is super relevant right now in this environment with recruiting and everything and layoffs.<br>
And I&#8217;m learning in real time, just seeing everything happening and also looking at my work and how I&#8217;m trying to help other businesses to try to develop and retain being a really big piece of that, their talent and how we can support that. But Gusto has been super great. It&#8217;s really great when you interview with a company and oh, you sell these mission and values and everything and you align with those things. And then after a few months at the company, you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, something don&#8217;t match up.&#8221; But I found that.<br>
I thought that I&#8217;m still like, wow, it still makes sense. It&#8217;s still relevant. And everyone is still what they sold me was true so that&#8217;s always good. It&#8217;s been quite the experience. I&#8217;m learning so much at this scale up and everyone around me and how we collaborate cross functionally is just awesome to work with these folks. They&#8217;re super talented. And it&#8217;s just an honor to work for a company. That&#8217;s doing some great things with some great folks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s actually, that&#8217;s really good to hear. I can tell you just from the end-user perspective, I first encountered Gusto last year at the current place where I&#8217;m working at. They use Gusto for payroll and all that sort of stuff. And the whole experience is so friendly and inviting-</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; which for HR software is a feat to accomplish because most of that stuff is like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m only going to go in here to file time off or whatever.&#8221; It&#8217;s not user friendly. It doesn&#8217;t spark joy to use Marie Kondo&#8217;s phrase it. It doesn&#8217;t give you those feelings of like, &#8220;Oh, I actually want to poke around and see what&#8217;s on these other pages. The illustrations are fun. The color coordination is great.&#8221; I mean, again, from the end-user perspective, I like it a lot.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah. That&#8217;s a big part of what you&#8217;re beat against those as well. It feels likely human. You talk about these friendly aspects of it. It&#8217;s a delightful experience. It&#8217;s easy to use. And yeah, typically HR software is not that, right? It&#8217;s not sexy. It&#8217;s not-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
&#8230; doesn&#8217;t make you want use it. It&#8217;s not approachable. Yeah. Design has been a big part of Gusto&#8217;s DNA since the beginning that one of the first hires of Gusto and when they were a startup 10 plus years ago, it was a design hire. So design has always been a big part of Gusto&#8217;s DNA.<br>
And we&#8217;re continuing that we have a big investment in design and being led by Amy, our chief design officer that speaks volumes to where, &#8220;Hey, at the highest levels we have advocacy for design.&#8221; And her leadership is she&#8217;s bringing that influence to conversations at those levels as well in our strategy and direction in our vision.<br>
So we don&#8217;t have to fight for that seat at the table. It&#8217;s already there. It&#8217;s all right now design, shows what you got let&#8217;s make this happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s really good. I think for a lot of tech startups, at least maybe it&#8217;s just the ones I&#8217;ve been at, but certainly there&#8217;s others that I&#8217;ve seen where design is always this afterthought. It&#8217;s something that maybe they&#8217;ll bring a designer on or they&#8217;ll have a few freelancers.<br>
But you can tell the focus is really on just making sure that the product works and adding new features to it. Design tends to be a bit of a&#8230; We&#8217;ll get to it kind of thing. It&#8217;s very utilitarian. So it&#8217;s good to hear that for Gusto, that design is really at the forefront of everything that y&#8217;all try to do.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Oh yeah, totally. You hit the nail around here what you said, design have this afterthought a lot of times, and it&#8217;s a strategic part of building a product, thinking about design. It&#8217;s not just that fresh coat of paint you do after you build something, right? It&#8217;s from the beginning talking to customers, learning about those user problems, and distilling that down to the root problems and finding a thoughtful way to approach that even that is part of design way before even start putting those pixels out there and start delivering mocks to the engineers and stuff like that. So it starts really, really early on before any code is pushed. So yeah, design being like this thread that&#8217;s followed throughout, even from the end of delivery of the designs. And that&#8217;s what we try to practice, keeping that spirit of design, being at the forefront of everything that we do. And that&#8217;s super important. It really shows in the product, right? So that experience that end-to-end experience, you can tell, &#8220;Hey, this has been designed,&#8221; not like, &#8220;Hey, we just layered something on top of something that was probably just strictly technically engineering led or something.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm. Talk to me more about what the team looks like? You&#8217;re on the product design team. I imagine. Is it for a specific feature of the app? Talk to me more about that.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah. So we broke it up in these segments and I mean, an employer segment. So we focus on all of our customers, our business owners who are using Gusto to pay their employees and ensure them and use HR tooling for performance management and all that. And my team specifically, we&#8217;re working on the HR side and our mission is to help customers develop and retain their talent.<br>
So my team is made up of myself, I&#8217;m the designer and I have a PM counterpart. He&#8217;s actually a hybrid a PM engineer, which is pretty amazing. He actually was a pretty strong, strong engineering leader in our team. And he actually started this PM rotation. And now he&#8217;s diving into that world and it&#8217;s been awesome to work with someone that has two sides of that coin there.<br>
And we also have about four or five other engineers supporting this team. So our team we&#8217;re pretty much building those HR tools. We have that part of Gusto&#8217;s space expanding, Gusto&#8217;s portfolio past, just the payment and the ensuring benefits and side of things going into that HR tooling space. So yeah, we&#8217;re super excited to bring that part of Gusto to our customers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, is this your first time working remotely for a team like this?</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
No, actually my remote professional journey actually started in my previous role at AdventHealth as a huge experience designer so that was the beginning of the pandemic. This is right around what? January 2020, somewhere around there. And a couple months into that, I was about a little bit over a year or so in that role, when I got into doing remote work for the first time, when they sent us home, they were like, &#8220;Hey, take your laptops and everything.&#8221; And being a part of AdventHealth, that&#8217;s a large health system.<br>
So there was a lot of need, as you can imagine for us to deliver some digital experiences, to help with some telehealth type of things we&#8217;re working on at the time. So that was a pretty accelerated, but a hyper learning time for me on both the product, working on a product side for designing those products for app health and as well as, &#8220;Hey, now we&#8217;re in this remote world.&#8221; How do we work, right? And just learning that you have to be really intentional about remote work to make that work. And communication is one of those big key learnings there during that experiences.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think a lot of companies definitely had to come to terms with that very quickly over the past couple of years. But for me, it&#8217;s been interesting. I&#8217;ve worked remotely since roughly about 2009, late 2008 was when-</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; I started, but I&#8217;ve been working remotely because I had my own studio for a long time. And then once I got back into the quote, unquote, &#8220;workforce,&#8221; at the end of 2017, every gig that I&#8217;ve had after that has been remote first. So even with times where you&#8217;ve had to still go to an office or for something like that, most I say 90% of the work that I&#8217;ve done over the past five years has all been remote.<br>
And it&#8217;s interesting seeing now how companies are trying to adapt to that, particularly in environments where that in person collaboration one was so key. But I would say also when it comes to looking for talents, a lot of these companies, if they&#8217;re in New York or in the San Francisco, Silicon Valley, et cetera, they&#8217;re used to looking for design talent right where they&#8217;re at.<br>
And now with the pandemic and people being able to work remotely as they are. I feel like that probably does a lot for decentralizing design talent. What do you think about that in this current environment?</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah, I think just being forced at a mass level to work remotely, I think a lot of employees, right? So as I sees, we realize that, &#8220;Hey, I can still do this work from home and I&#8217;m actually enjoying all these other benefits that comes with that, right?&#8221; So obviously I don&#8217;t have to commute to work. There&#8217;s all that stuff eliminated. You save some time, but then also on the business side of things, you realize that there&#8217;s more focus on your outcomes versus your outputs.<br>
I feel like there&#8217;s a new type of lens being put onto what are actually the employees producing, what are the actual outcomes of that experience? And I think just realizing all these different things and some of the advantages, and obviously there&#8217;s some disadvantages around communication and being more intentional about that. But I think it levels the playing field in a way. Now we&#8217;re looking at it from a perspective of, &#8220;Hey, I can hire anyone from anywhere in the country.&#8221;<br>
They can do that work from home, right? And then we have to think about how do we strategically compete now on this level because now that someone like myself where I&#8217;m in Florida, so Gusto in California and being able to work remotely, there&#8217;s obviously a distribution now of talent across the entire country. So I think it switches the conversation a little bit less about location and proximity to some of these more bigger tech hubs in New Yorker, San Francisco.<br>
And it&#8217;s now strictly focused on the talent itself. What are they producing? What are the outcomes? What impacts that come with these specific candidates when we&#8217;re talking to them? So I think, yeah, it&#8217;s pretty much leveling that playing field, but now I think another shift in that is around now that it&#8217;s a level, in a sense we&#8217;re looking at talent, that bar is getting more competitive as well.<br>
So I think that&#8217;s an interesting dynamic that&#8217;s happening, but I think it&#8217;s a good one. I think on both the company and the talent side of things, everyone&#8217;s looking at the things that matter more. So at the end of the day, it&#8217;s about the outcomes, the impacts that you actually have as a designer, as an engineer versus your outputs. It&#8217;s like, oh, I can see you doing things in the office. And generally these office of conversations and things it&#8217;s easier to hide.<br>
I feel like when you&#8217;re in an office setting versus remotely like, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re strictly measuring based on,&#8221; Like, &#8220;Hey, what can you actually tangibly impact to the team in the business?&#8221; There&#8217;s more of a focus on those things now. And especially in this time where we&#8217;re contracting a little bit in the markets, right? So companies are doing layoffs and they&#8217;re trying to save money, right? So they&#8217;re looking at like, &#8220;Hey, do I have the right people to support my company for the next 10 plus years?&#8221; Where do I need to strategically invest in talent? And where is waste?<br>
Unfortunately, there is a layout since things happening because people might have over hired, right? During previous years and didn&#8217;t foresee some of this economic type of turmoil going on and everything with the market and the economics of this country. But yeah, it&#8217;s being very strategic about who you&#8217;re hiring and there&#8217;s a more to focus on individual impact.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely. I mean, I know that there were certainly a few companies that during the pandemic, they really became unicorns in a way. A lot of companies really leaned on them. And then now that culture is changing. As people are starting to get back out there, more travel, offices in some places are reopening, et cetera.<br>
Now it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, we need to scale back because we can&#8217;t support the level at which we&#8217;ve grown or they haven&#8217;t found an effective way to, I don&#8217;t know, I guess pivots to that, which is just business. That&#8217;s just how business goes. But to what you said earlier around about how this new environment means that you can pull talent from anywhere, it does strip away a lot of the&#8230;<br>
I would say trappings of work, a lot of social trappings of work before I&#8217;m saying this we&#8217;re back in the old days, but it was more about showing up to work at a certain time and you hang out after work and you get to know people. And I mean, that stuff is great. But then when everyone&#8217;s just reporting in a Slack team, it strips away all these ways that you try to be so overly social that it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; What about the work that you&#8217;re doing-</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; is the output of the work? What we need? Or are you just nice to have around?</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That whole thing about, I feel like, and I don&#8217;t know how true this is, but I feel like that whole excuse about a culture fit gets weakened a bit now, because of this new environment.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah. I totally agree with that. That culture fit is definitely weakened in a sense, right? One of the interesting thing, I don&#8217;t know if you saw this, but with remote work as well, a lot of companies have able to become a lot more diverse. They saw Black employees have risen some of the percentages there. It&#8217;s pretty interesting to see how it&#8217;s that decentralization of talent, someone who&#8217;s in a specific part of the country.<br>
That&#8217;s not willing to move to the west coast to work for a specific company but they&#8217;re available now, right? So now I can hire that person and companies have actually become more diverse now being able to do that in remote. So there&#8217;s a lot of different changing dynamics. And I think for the most part, I think it&#8217;s a net good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think so, too. What would you say is probably the most challenging part about the work that you&#8217;re doing now?</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Oh man, the challenge that I would say the work that I&#8217;m doing now, well on one side of it, the remote side of it as well, communication, I alluded to this earlier. That&#8217;s one of the keys to being super successful in a team, right? So being able to communicate effectively, but as far as the work itself, we&#8217;re taking on a new challenge, right? So Gusto historically has been more on the payroll and benefit side of things and we&#8217;re doing a lot of learning and talking to customers and trying to figure out what are the hardest challenges they&#8217;re facing right now in trying to engage and retain employees.<br>
And what&#8217;s happening right now with folks that are doing layoffs and things like that. It&#8217;s very hard to try to get ahead of that, right? In case as an employee, but also on the business side, if you&#8217;re not doing layoffs, then employees who decide to leave for another company, how do you even get ahead of something like that? We talk to a lot of customers who try to understand those pains and how do you develop people internally too?<br>
So it&#8217;s a super interesting space just working. It&#8217;s working in people, basically it&#8217;s people management and that&#8217;s a super hard thing to work in as well. Just how do you look at these relationships between companies and employees and try to help these companies retain these folks?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think now certainly with us now being roughly three years in with this, there are people I&#8217;ve had on the show who have started their career in a remote position. And now they&#8217;re moving from remote position to remote position. And the difficulty that I see some of them with is that the job changes.<br>
But I&#8217;m still in the same place because it&#8217;s from home, they&#8217;re working from home and it&#8217;s like, yeah, you can set those boundaries and close that laptop and such. But that separation is just so hard to have between a physical office and your home. Everything is condensed into one space.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s hard to make that separation for sure. And even every day I just get up and close my laptop and then I turn around and the TV&#8217;s right there. I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t really feel like you&#8217;re actually disconnected sometimes. But I have done a lot of freelancing actually for a very long time since being in college and I&#8217;m actually been used to it to some degree.<br>
So I&#8217;d have a day job as doing a design and going into an office, but then I&#8217;d also do freelance on the side where I&#8217;m actually working at home and helping folks with doing their websites or whatever at that time. So it was in a&#8230; I was prepared for this moment and I think that&#8217;s why I leaned into it so heavily.<br>
As soon as I got tasted remote, I was like, &#8220;Oh yeah, this is me.&#8221; And I literally was looking after my last role. I was like, &#8220;Hey, I got to find something that was that&#8217;s remote first.&#8221; That&#8217;s what I want. I know that&#8217;s where I&#8217;d be comfortable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, for me, the main way to have that separation is to&#8230; And I mean, this is a luxury, I think to even say this, but to have two separate machines, my main machine at home that I work on is a windows desktop. And my work machine is a MacBook pro.<br>
So it&#8217;s completely different for me at the end of the day, I close my laptop, I put it in the closet one, so I don&#8217;t have to see it, just I don&#8217;t want that visual cue, but then when I&#8217;m getting ready for the next day work is right there. So it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, take the laptop out, plug it in. I&#8217;m at work now.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
So you not only have that physical separation and actually being able to see it, but then you also have a different operating system.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. It&#8217;s completely different operating system, different peripherals. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; I have to really separate it that way. Because back when I had my studio and I&#8217;ll talk about your freelance work too. But back when I had my studio, I would tell people, &#8220;Yeah, I can work half days all the time, any 12 hours I want.&#8221; I would just stay on the computer, working, working, working, because there wasn&#8217;t that separation for me. I was doing work and non-work from the same machine.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah. I will say that. So I&#8217;m the type of person where time can run away from me. I can be working and then I can forget that I need to quote, unquote, &#8220;clock out, right?&#8221; So my wife tries to pull me my desk. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s past five. What are you doing?&#8221; One thing I&#8217;m excited about. Like I mentioned earlier, I&#8217;m working to be getting a house soon.<br>
So I will have a dedicated office. So right now I&#8217;m in this, it&#8217;s an office/space that we used to watch TV. But when there&#8217;s more of a separation there, I can intentionally walk out of here and be like, &#8220;All right, works done.&#8221; Now I&#8217;m going to live my personal life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. You&#8217;ll love it. I&#8217;m telling you just having that separate space. That is great.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;m looking forward to it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit, learn more about you and about where you grew up. You alluded to college and studying design and I want to get there eventually, but let&#8217;s go back. Tell me about your childhood were you kind exposed to a lot of art and design and stuff growing up?</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah, I would say I have been exposed to a lot of art and design in very subtle ways. I grew up in Miami, Florida as where I was born. And at the time, I used to watch a lot of cartoons. I loved cartoons and I used to just try to redraw different cartoons. Of course, during my time, Dragon ball Z stuff like that. And I used to really do a lot of comics myself. I could try to basically create comic book series. I actually came up with one, I think in middle school. I even distributed it out and tried to sell some.<br>
And so I was always super into drawing and art and design, and I was just always trying to find creative outlet. I was more of a house like nerd. So I&#8217;m looking into doing things on the computer. I didn&#8217;t even start doing anything digitally until later, but I was very much so thinking that, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m going to be an artist or something like that when I grow up or whatever.&#8221;<br>
And then when I got to high school, I started looking at really, how can I really make a career out of this? And that&#8217;s when I started contracting a little bit on the creativity side and looking to what actual careers are out there. And I looked at being an architect basically. So I did enrollment for architectural drafting while I was in high school, which I came out with an architectural drafting degree actually out of it.<br>
This was basically me doing half my time in my senior and junior year at a trade school to earn that certificate. And then after that, I went to USF for college and major in architecture. And I was really convinced in that was what I was really going to do first of my life. And I tried to put myself in this box where I was like, &#8220;Hey, I can only make money doing something that&#8217;s serious, right?&#8221; I have to be an architect-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
&#8230; that&#8217;s the only way I can create, I can express myself creatively and I still love architecture. I still love it. But I quickly realized when doing that coursework that I was mainly interested in the purely aesthetic side of just&#8230; I know if you ever seen concepts of different buildings and things like, &#8220;Oh, if what nature was integrated into certain structures and we could live in harmony with nature and these different wacky building styles.&#8221;<br>
I was doing stuff like that and doing in that course and architecture and I was less interested in stuff like building code and stuff like that. So yeah, about halfway through that, I was like, &#8220;This is not for me.&#8221; I was lost for a little bit honestly. I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to do.&#8221; But I think around that time I pledged five days Sigma in college.<br>
And one of the things that I had to do for my coming out show, well I took it by myself, was we needed a flyer and I actually made. My first flyer that I ever made was actually created in a combination of PowerPoint and Microsoft paint, so that was my first flyer, yeah. And then I was like, &#8220;You know what? That was cool. I enjoyed that.&#8221;<br>
And then I sat down for a summer and was looking like, &#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s the actual industry standard tool I can use to make something like this.&#8221; And that&#8217;s when I taught myself Photoshop. And after that was the bullet train to just creating endeavors and doing things for people, just designing flyers that started off with that and then doing logos. And then actually guys started doing websites for people.<br>
And that&#8217;s when I started to see the light, right? I was looking like, &#8220;Oh wow, I can actually create these really cool websites for people and make them look really nice and people will pay me for it.&#8221; And I was doing freelance while I was in undergrad. And then I was still searching like, &#8220;Hey, I want to do this professionally.&#8221;<br>
And that&#8217;s when I started taking jobs, doing graphic design. I took a job at a local. There was a Gyros and Subs locally in Tampa, Florida. And I did all their marketing. I did their menu and I did some work on their website, their email marketing. And yeah, I took a series of jobs after that, just around design and web design and started doing marketing sites.<br>
And yeah, then after that I actually got exposed to doing product design and UX design. When one client basically asked me, &#8220;Hey, can you do an app?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Sure.&#8221; I will say yes to everything and just figure out with the layer. So I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Listen, I already know.&#8221; And sometimes I&#8217;ll tell them straight up. I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to do this, but I&#8217;m going to figure it out.&#8221; Yeah. That&#8217;s why I took this deep dive into learning UX myself.<br>
And I was like, &#8220;All right, I need some formal structure around this.&#8221; It&#8217;s not just something I could just pick up. I have to know how to think in this way and how to solve a specific problem and approaching it from these different ways. I took this Interaction Design Foundation as this online type of classes that you can take basically different modules.<br>
And that&#8217;s where I formalized my education around UX design I was like, &#8220;Hey, how do I apply some of my creativity and get some more of this skills on the side of UX to really understand having user-centered problems and really solving it from these really thoughtful ways and using user journeys and end-to-end flows,&#8221; so that was how I really started to formalize my education around it.<br>
And from there, that&#8217;s why I started taking jobs from different companies doing product design eventually got to&#8230; I feel like AdventHealth was my first true rigorous cross-functional experience. I was working with product design, but I did along the way, I&#8217;ve learned so much from different companies out at Sodexo for a few years, doing graphic design there. And I got a little bit of exposure to doing some product design and I just wanted more of it. So I just started to align myself more and more with doing UX. And, yeah, here I am today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I think it&#8217;s really worth mentioning that you cut your teeth on product design online. It wasn&#8217;t through a traditional four-year course or something. It was because you already, I guess, built an interest through your natural talent and curiosity and the work that you had been doing, but to then find a program online and then use that to level up to the next stage of your career, I think is something that probably a lot of people listening can get inspired by.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah, I think the most beautiful thing about. I think a lot of careers in product, there&#8217;s a lot of these unconventional pathways and especially in UX, I&#8217;ll hear different stories, very similar to mine. You don&#8217;t have to actually go to these specific design schools and stuff like that. There&#8217;s other ways that you can get there. It&#8217;s really just aligning your passion and just being able to apply yourself. Because if you&#8217;re going to do take a path like mine, you have to really want it.<br>
So you got to be really committed because it&#8217;s not easy to pretty much teach yourself, stay focused because all this stuff was self-paced, right? It&#8217;s all out of my own passion, wanting to learn more. I was hungry for that knowledge. If you have that core part of like, you can definitely chase that in these different paths. But if you need more structure, then yeah, I would definitely say, &#8220;Hey, go to design school if that&#8217;s for you.&#8221;<br>
But I know for me that was&#8230; I probably would have gone to a design school and like that, but I did not even have the exposure. I even to know that was out there. So I had to make due with what I had at the time. I was like, &#8220;Okay, well I&#8217;m already three years in here at USF. I wasted a couple years doing architecture. I know I want to do design.&#8221; Then I see that I can still probably get hired for doing design without having a full design degree. So I was like, &#8220;You know what?&#8221; I mean, I got a degree in information architecture, which did a lot of web design things, but that was actually supportive of it as well in my skillset.<br>
So yeah, there&#8217;s these very unconventional pathways you can take, but just find what works best for you and get after it. But I think just having that exposure earlier, the better, if I would&#8217;ve had that, my path would&#8217;ve been much different, but I found a way eventually. So it worked out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And I mean, you found a way, but also as you mentioned, you had that discipline to do it on your own. A lot of these courses they can give you or they do give you the information, they lay out a path for you, but if you&#8217;re not going to actually follow it and take it, then it&#8217;s for nothing.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Exactly, exactly. Just have that focus. If you&#8217;re going to like just be intentional about everything you do. If you know that something that you really want, just go after it and just stay focused. I think over the next few years, I think just the fact that information is so plentiful now. You imagine 15 years ago, all these resources weren&#8217;t even out here and then go even further back.<br>
It&#8217;s just so democratized at this point, but now it&#8217;s going to be the difference makers, the people who want it versus the people who are just doing it like, &#8220;Hey, just so nice to have. And I&#8217;m half in half out.&#8221; So yeah, it&#8217;s going to be&#8230; We&#8217;ll see that separately time plays out so.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I&#8217;ve been around long enough. I can imagine. I know because I was there. I remember 15 years ago. It definitely was not like this at all. I mean, hell even I would say maybe not even 10 years ago, you started to have some of the beginnings of some things you had, I think the beginnings of a general assembly or a tree house or something, but what you also really just had were things that people cobbled together of different snippets of code and things of that nature you had like, &#8220;Oh God, I&#8217;m dating myself.&#8221;<br>
But you had dynamic drive. You had W3 Schools and stuff like that in lieu of something that could be more, I guess, official like a general assembly or a tree house or something of that where you could actually go through a more formalized career thing, almost like school, because you would have an instructor of sorts or someone that&#8217;s at least looking at assignments and giving you feedback in that way. It&#8217;s self-governed but at least you have that expert authority to help you along the way.<br>
Prior to that, you just put stuff together and hope for the best. You really were like. I hope this works or there was so much experimentation back then. And I don&#8217;t know if the web really encompasses a lot of that now because so many things or productized and there&#8217;s design systems and such that everything is pretty rigidly locked into certain systems in order to scale.<br>
And of course, to bring in designers and engineers and writers to all work together. But one thing that the early web definitely had, was a lot of just creativity-</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:37:35].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; just people experimenting, just people making things up. And I feel like that same feeling is why a lot of folks are interested in Web3 right now.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Mm-hmm. I think so.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They want that or they&#8217;re trying to get that feeling of freedom back that the early web had and granted Web3 encompasses a number of technologies. It&#8217;s NFTs, it&#8217;s crypto. It&#8217;s a number of stuff. And I feel like a lot of what&#8217;s reported out of it is largely very negative, but to be fair, it was like that when the internet first came about.<br>
Like everyone was not hopping to get online. It was a lot of skepticism about what is an email address? Should my business be online? How do I make this happen? There was a lot of skepticism and granted, eventually people got over that hump. I think Web3 is probably a little different in this accord because of aside from just the learning curve in terms of figuring out all these different terms and stuff, which again, very similar to before, it&#8217;s also just the cost. I mean, I would say back then personal computers were, I mean my God, I got my first personal computer in whoo &#8217;99, 1999 it was a Pentium 3. It was 500 megabytes. Maybe not megabytes, maybe it was 500. It probably was 500 megabytes.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
It probably, it might have been.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It might have been. Yeah, it might have been.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
It might have been without so much more computing power in the palm of our hands. Actually on my wrist right now, probably-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right, right.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
&#8230; computing power.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Back then you could play solitaire, but now you could easily do that on your phone or something like that with an app. But I say all that to say that even that was a bit of a curve for a lot of people&#8217;s like, &#8220;Can I afford a computer in order to do these things? Can I afford?&#8221; Well, there actually wasn&#8217;t high speed internet back then. You had dial up, but you had two lanes, you had a slow lane and a fast lane. That&#8217;s what they colloquially called it.<br>
And then eventually you had DSL and then cable and now high speed is fiber optic, et cetera, and stuff like that. But I see a lot of those parallels. And then I notice just how design is very much following those parallels as well. So I wonder in the future how Web3 is going to impact a lot of what we know now, even typically as product design, because product design is very much within a two-dimensional space.<br>
But it&#8217;s also a lot of the interactions and the patterns and stuff are for a level of computing that we&#8217;ve had around roughly for the past 15 to 20-ish years. Once people start jumping into augmented reality, virtual reality, the metaverse and stuff like that brings up a whole new host of interactions and scenarios and problems as well, so-</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; that&#8217;s interesting.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s a lot of unlock. Yeah. I think it&#8217;s a lot of unlock that&#8217;s going to happen in the next few years. I think definitely what you touched on with augmented reality. I don&#8217;t know if you had Annie Jean-Baptiste here on the show but, she works at Google and I saw something recently with basically just allowing folks who deaf people, folks who can&#8217;t hear like to wear these glasses essentially. And they can basically see on the glasses, the words that are being spoken, written out in the glasses from there, they can see the words, right?<br>
So I thought that those were one of those magical things that can be done with technology. And when things that are changing with having some of this spatial computing happening with augmenting your reality with adding another layer, basically into your environment, I think that&#8217;s yet another frontier that is yet to be designed for a lot of exciting things. I think as it technology matures, that&#8217;ll be really cool to touch upon.<br>
And yeah, I&#8217;m excited to see where things go. I do like experimentation just generally seeing folks going to the NFTs and doing all these different things. I think everything happens in a cycle and things have become very strict and there&#8217;s a lot of rules and everything fits into a box and this might be another frontier where things are starting to expand a little bit and there&#8217;s a new space to start to design for.<br>
And there&#8217;s the rules aren&#8217;t set in stone yet. So until that happens, there&#8217;ll be a lot of experimentation and folks are going to be going in a lot of different directions. So I&#8217;m excited to see where things go. I&#8217;m pretty optimistic about technology usually. So I&#8217;m definitely open to seeing and talking about those things too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So you&#8217;re in Florida, you&#8217;re in Orlando or right near Orlando. How is the design community there? Have you found a lot of that there?</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Oh yeah. There&#8217;s a design community here. I would say basically on the UX side, there&#8217;s a downtown Orlando UX. This is actually a group that my former manager at AdventHealth, he organizes that group and it&#8217;s pretty small. It&#8217;s pretty small. That&#8217;s one of many design, little meetups that happen here. But I wouldn&#8217;t say the design community is that big, but it is growing.<br>
There&#8217;s also a small VC startup community here as well. There&#8217;s a lot of little startups that you might not have heard of, but then are stealth mode that are happening here. I think there&#8217;s a lot of just between some of these major Florida cities. I feel like there&#8217;s a lot of cross-pollination that is happening folks that are in Miami, folks that are in Tampa, folks that are Orlando.<br>
There&#8217;s a lot of networking that are happening between folks there, because I think there&#8217;s a lot of little bit of proximity there, but I think there&#8217;s going to be definitely just a lot bigger community of designers and folks doing product here in Orlando. I mean, especially since the people can be remote now, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, well I can move to Florida.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Cool.&#8221;<br>
So Miami is super expensive, but Orlando is getting there, but they&#8217;re not the worst. So this is my open invitation to folks that come to Orlando. I think it&#8217;s pretty great community and it&#8217;s growing. So yeah, interesting to see where that goes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you talk a bit there about that startup scene. I think we know when folks look at the south. I mean, I think they can, I don&#8217;t know how much of Florida they really leave out. Well, I know for example, back in the day.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
But Florida is not like a south-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
&#8230; if you don&#8217;t include Florida at all. I&#8217;m like,-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know it&#8217;s tricky.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
&#8230; &#8220;I think [inaudible 00:43:54] southern,&#8221; but sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it is tricky because I don&#8217;t know. Maybe let&#8217;s say from Mississippi to Georgia. Well, so all going further, let&#8217;s say Mississippi to North Carolina, a lot of that, of course, people think of as the south. And then even when people think of tech or design, a lot of that gets left out unless people are thinking about Atlanta.<br>
I remember just even 10 years ago, people would talk about what&#8217;s going on in design in the south. And they wouldn&#8217;t even look at Atlanta. They&#8217;d just look at Florida. They&#8217;d look at what&#8217;s going on in Miami? What&#8217;s going on in Orlando? And there&#8217;s six states that you all are missing. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, nothing&#8217;s really going on there.&#8221; I guess, they thought we were just all barefoot blowing on jugs or something.<br>
There&#8217;s technology here. There&#8217;s design here, which people now are taking note of, particularly as it relates to diversity. But again, the way that things are changing in just a number of different years and now with people being able to work from anywhere because they have remote work, you&#8217;re starting to see, I think you&#8217;re starting to see these talent centers even shifting.<br>
I was reading today about how folks a lot of people are working out of Mexico City and the locals in Mexico City are go away. It used to be good here. And now y&#8217;all work from home. People moved here and you drove the cost up and you acted stupid like go somewhere else.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
The techies are ruining the scene.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, it wouldn&#8217;t be the first city, right?</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But what you&#8217;re starting also to see that point of decentralized talent is now work from home means work from anywhere. There&#8217;s people at my current job that, I mean, they are like jet setting. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m in Hungary this month. Oh, this month I&#8217;m in Memphis, Tennessee. Oh, this month I&#8217;m in Mexico City.&#8221; And they can work out of those places because they can work quote, unquote, &#8220;From home,&#8221; which people are taking to me from anywhere.<br>
But I think companies now are even starting to try to restrict that because what if you work from, I don&#8217;t know, what if you work from Cuba? What if you work from Russia or something? If you&#8217;re working from maybe a place that&#8217;s not so politically stable, what does that mean? So it&#8217;s opened things up, but then I think it&#8217;s also probably generated some different issues also.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah. I think that some of the companies are out there are finding some strategic ways to still give that flexibility with you can work from anywhere. I think Airbnb had something recently around, &#8220;Hey, you can even work at a different country for a set period of time.&#8221; You&#8217;re not going to be there for the whole year or something, but you can go to different countries and work from there for a month or something.<br>
I forgot what the timeframe was, but there&#8217;s different things like that. And those companies that are going to be setting some of these different policies, that&#8217;ll be flexible and that they&#8217;re going to make sense to folks. So when you look at them, you be like, &#8220;That makes sense.&#8221; And also that&#8217;s really attractive. I like that model, folks are going to start picking those companies over others.<br>
That&#8217;s a competitive advantage when you look at it from this 10,000 foot you&#8217;re looking at, &#8220;Hey, what are the companies that are being super restrictive? What are the companies that are the most flexible with this? And with that fits with my way of life.&#8221; I think all of this is going to be a journey of alignment. Everyone is looking for what is that company you able to do for me? And what the company is looking at for talent is like? What are these specific folks able to do for my company?<br>
So that I think is on both sides, space, you had journey of alignment. We&#8217;re trying to find that equilibrium. We&#8217;re not there yet. I think everybody&#8217;s learning, but there&#8217;s going to be a lot of folks stumbling along the way as we&#8217;ve been seeing for a little bit now. And when we find that place to meet, find that middle ground to where things work, people will be making those choices. And they&#8217;ll be that clear separation of folks who are doing remote well and folks who aren&#8217;t doing remote well. And I think it&#8217;s going to play out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think so too. I mean, even now for job seekers, that&#8217;s now a consideration. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, well what does the remote work policy look like? Or can I work from anywhere?&#8221; Or even if you&#8217;re able to work from anywhere like some hybrid situation. Because some people do want to have that option to go into an office, but-</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; it varies now. And I think companies have to try to realize that now with the pandemic, things have changed. It&#8217;s not even so much that things have changed in terms of the fact that people aren&#8217;t working in offices, but workers expect more flexibility now with where they work-</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; and that&#8217;s something that is&#8230; That&#8217;s a big paradigm shift.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s been proven that it work can be done from anywhere and that you can still deliver product right from anywhere.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
And companies are seeing some advantages of that too. And we&#8217;re just trying to find our way, I think, with some of the shortcomings of remote. So I think having that hybrid model is what&#8217;s there to stay is, like some folks might still want to go to the office. They have that option. Cool. They&#8217;re in proximity of some of those epicenters, the New York, California have those options, but then you&#8217;ll also have that talent pool that are fully remote as well.<br>
But I think it&#8217;s still important that these teams can still come together. At Gusto, we still like find these moments that, I&#8217;ve only been there for about a year now, but we&#8217;ve already come together twice. I went to San Francisco to do an onsite with my team and I left that feeling super energized for sure, meeting my teammates for the first time and us going out and doing some activities and team building exercises and my team building, I just mean just going to have fun going have dinner, stuff like that.<br>
But those times were pretty fun. And we&#8217;re actually looking forward to in a couple months, I think in October, I&#8217;m going to go to Denver, we&#8217;re going to do another onsite there. So yeah, so still coming together for those special moments with your team, I think is a good balance. If you have a fully distributed team being able to do that a couple times a year, I feel like that works pretty well in my experience right now. I feel like it&#8217;s a good balance.<br>
Everyone loves how structure is so far right now. And I think that&#8217;s where companies are trying to find where that what makes sense for their company and then what also works for employee engagement. So I think everyone just finding their way with that and finding what&#8217;s the right balance? What&#8217;s the right cadence of meeting up together? Those are the teams they&#8217;re going to win.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Right now with where you are in life and in your career. How do you define success?</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Well, I think success is definitely going to be defined by your impact at the end of the day, you on two fronts, right? So impacting those interpersonal relationships, the folks that you&#8217;re working with around you, people remember how you make them feel, right? So how they remember working with you? So I&#8217;m trying to also level up how I communicate? How I work with folks? Being able to include folks in things that we&#8217;re doing on our team and then also leveraging business impact as well. I think that&#8217;s another big key part.<br>
I think of leveling up in careers in general is just being able to tie back what you&#8217;re doing to the goals of the business. So I think alluded to the storytelling piece as well. I think that&#8217;s another big part of that is just being able to tie that back to, &#8220;Hey, here&#8217;s the story that we tell about our customers. Here&#8217;s the opportunity that I&#8217;m trying to unlock with their pain and then how this translates to how the business can thrive by helping customers.&#8221;<br>
So yeah, I&#8217;m just trying to tie all these things together. Be a good person, be a good human at the same time. I think it&#8217;s very much so about how as well, how you get to certain places in life and also professionally? I think those things do matter and how the impression that you leave on folks? So I&#8217;m just trying to do things sustainably and make sure that I&#8217;m having that impact along the way and growing.<br>
I consider myself a lifelong learner as I&#8217;ve taught myself a lot of things, but there&#8217;s a lot more that you can still learn. And I&#8217;m just trying to take in as much information and trying to level up as a designer from different avenues, even beyond design, trying to getting to learn more about product. I&#8217;m trying to understand the technical engineering side and how to work better with my engineers as well.<br>
So it&#8217;s a learning process, but I think if you&#8217;re challenging yourself every time to do better and learn more, it&#8217;s you don&#8217;t do 1% better, you do a little bit good every single day, 1%. And you&#8217;ll start looking back to a year, be like, &#8220;Wow, I made so much progress.&#8221; It didn&#8217;t feel it at the time, but damn I did that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What advice would you give out there to people that are listening to your story and they want to follow in your footsteps? What would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah, I would say be hungry, just be hungry for learning, be hungry to solve problems for people because that&#8217;s what these companies are looking for. At the end of the day is aligning your passion like, &#8220;Hey, I can do X, Y, and Z really well.&#8221; And then a company&#8217;s looking for that, but then also you want to align to their&#8230; You want your values and motivation to be aligned to that company as well.<br>
So just try to make sure you have the baseline like, &#8220;Hey, I have the skills now let&#8217;s look at some of these other quote, unquote, &#8220;Soft skills.&#8221; Like how&#8217;s my communication? How&#8217;s my storytelling?&#8221; Those parts are harder to master, but with practice, you&#8217;ll get there. But I think just at the end of the day, I think that talent bars is going up for designers.<br>
And I think what&#8217;s going to be a big differentiator for designers that are starting out as well, is being able to pair their design skills, being able to augment their design skills with storytelling and business strategy, because companies are really, really looking for that and making sure you can tie back what you do to those things. It&#8217;s just going to be crucial.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That reminds me a lot of the words of Douglas Davis that we&#8217;ve had on the show twice now. He&#8217;s the author of a book about-</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Business ticket of design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; yeah, exactly. It&#8217;s about making sure that you&#8217;re able to bring those things to the table because in terms of visual design, and this is pandemic aside, your visual design skills are a dime a dozen. And honestly there&#8217;s probably always going to be someone that could do it for better, cheaper or faster. If you&#8217;re able to bring some advantage to the table, along with your design that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to be the differentiator like you said.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I read that book and I remember that as well. That was a key unlock for me in my mind. I was like, &#8220;Wow.&#8221; There&#8217;s a lot of folks who have great design craft and it&#8217;s great to look at it. You can look all over dribble and see all that awesome design, but none of those are solving business problems. Most of them, anyways, they&#8217;re just there for aesthetic folks.<br>
Just look at it for pleasure, but actually what does it solve when you look at business at the end of the day, that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re there to do. They hired you to produce these outcomes for the business. There&#8217;s a goals that they&#8217;re trying to attain. And I think as designers, we of heard, &#8220;Hey, design wants to see the table.&#8221; All right, we&#8217;re at the table now. Yeah.<br>
Now, at the table, you got to be able to have that business speak. You have to be able to tell that story and be able to tie these things back to business outcomes. So yeah, I think Douglas Davis book is excellent read. I would definitely recommend every designer to read that. And then yeah, I&#8217;ve done some work as well in trying to level up my business skills and design and trying to pair that impact and was great at Gusto too, we did a workshop with designer fund as well to talk about that and learn more about how you can bring that business impact into your work and tell that story?<br>
So it&#8217;s definitely something that we think we invest in ourselves and our designers at Gusto so that tells you a lot about how important this is? The business cares about leveling up their designers to understand that so that&#8217;s super important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
You know, I&#8217;m at this crosswords where you think about a designer or any profession where you&#8217;re an IC and you think the next step is logically going into management or people management. I never saw myself in people management and I&#8217;m not sure that I do, but I know I do like to be able to mentor folks, mentoring a designer, I guess.<br>
So right now, and it&#8217;s super rewarding to hear their experiences and how they&#8217;re approaching network. And I&#8217;m starting to get more comfortable with that type of work. But I could as much see myself as still being an IC at a higher level in the future, as well as maybe dialing into people management, because I think there&#8217;s some rewarding work. It&#8217;s very different work. It&#8217;s not like, &#8220;Oh, I go to people management, I&#8217;m going to get on a promotion.&#8221; It&#8217;s a different level of work. You&#8217;re in the people business. You&#8217;re there to empower the folks that report to you and help unblock them to help them to develop.<br>
So I think that&#8217;s a way of being able to be that resource for other people and just being able to pass on knowledge that you have and to help others grow. I think that&#8217;s awesome. I think at the end of the day, if you have a passion for helping people as designers, that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re doing, but going into people management is another way to do that as well.<br>
I&#8217;m empowering and helping someone else to help other people and help unblock them as well and guide them. So that might be a path for me, but we&#8217;ll see, I&#8217;m still learning and I&#8217;m very much so in IT space right now, but we&#8217;ll see what the future holds. Maybe we&#8217;ll have a podcast in the future. You can ask me again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Well, just to wrap things up, where can our audience find more information about you, about your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m on Twitter mainly. Twitter is my jam, but also I&#8217;m on LinkedIn. Those are the main two places that you can connect with me. You can reach out, you can DM if you have any questions and I&#8217;d love to talk to people. I love to chat. I&#8217;m pretty open. So yeah, just hit me up on there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Jeff Jean-Baptiste, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I think what really comes across to me as you describe your story and even the work that you&#8217;re doing right now is that there&#8217;s this energy and there&#8217;s this passion for what you do that really, I think shines through. It&#8217;s one thing, like you said, to be able to roll with the punches with the way that the current environment is going.<br>
But the thing that sets you apart from other designers is what you&#8217;re bringing to the table. And I think more so than just your design skills and your business skills, you&#8217;re bringing yourself to the table. You&#8217;re showing up as a very personable, energetic person. And I think people will be able to really feel that from this interview, they can get that sense of this is who you are and this is what you bring to the table. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Jean-Baptiste:</b><br>
Maurice, thanks so much. I just want to say this was awesome time talking to you and yeah, I think what you&#8217;re doing is well for the design community and Black designers and practitioners and engineers at large has been great. This is a show I&#8217;ve actually listened to way back and earlier in my career. So I would attribute a lot of my success to this podcast. So thanks.</p>

<p>I love when interviews sometimes bring out unexpected connections. Take this week&#8217;s guest, Corey Jones. As creative director at Forum One, Corey specializes in branding, animation, and interactive design. But as you&#8217;ll find out from our conversation, he got his start from <a href="/black-love-by-design-part-2-of-2/" data-wpel-link="internal">a Black design studio we featured back in 2016</a>! It&#8217;s a small world!</p>
<p>Corey and I talked at length about his work at Forum One, and he shared his story of growing up outside of Pittsburgh and studying design in college. We also talked about his early career, his YouTube channel, creative burnout, and his line of barbecue sauce with his twin brother. Corey is proof that with hard work and determination, you can make a career out of creativity for yourself!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
Well, hello, I&#8217;m Corey Jones. I&#8217;m a creative director. I do visual design, and I&#8217;m curious creator. At work, I do a little bit of everything, so I&#8217;m in motion design industry, but I&#8217;m also doing interactive design for web experiences. It runs the gamut. But right now, I&#8217;m a creative director at Forum One.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s the summer been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
So far, summer&#8217;s good. The past couple days have been really, really, really hot, but I&#8217;m actually in the process of moving to a different part of New Jersey and so I&#8217;m been doing that. But the summer&#8217;s great. I got the chance to spend some time with my family not too long ago. And it&#8217;s been a while since I had seen them, and so it was great to get back to Pennsylvania, which is where I&#8217;m from.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. What do you have coming up these next few months? Aside from the move, I should mention.</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
Yeah, well, aside from the move, I&#8217;m doing some work with my brother and thinking about what we&#8217;re going to do with the sauce. We&#8217;ll talk about that later, but what&#8217;s the next stage in Jones&#8217;en Barbecue. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;m looking forward to. But just outside of that, we&#8217;ve got a lot of great projects coming up. I&#8217;m excited to dive into those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about Forum One. First of all, what is Forum One? And two, just let me know what your experience has been like there so far.</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
Yeah, so I work at Forum One. I&#8217;m the creative director there now. I started out as a senior interaction designer when I started there. But Forum One is a agency, their mission is dedicated to working with mission driven organizations; we have a some government clients there as well. But a lot of our work is centered around working with organizations that are making an impact in the world. And it&#8217;s one of the things that intrigued me and drew me to it, it was because it was a place that had a bigger mission. And something like that, as a designer, I found that to be very inspiring.<br>
And so far, I&#8217;ve been there for oh a little over&#8230; Many years, I&#8217;ll say. I can&#8217;t even keep track. It might be seven years by now. But I&#8217;ve been there, and it&#8217;s been a great experience. I&#8217;ve been able to progress a lot faster here than I was able to at other places. And I found it to be a very supportive culture where I&#8217;ve got the opportunity to work on some really, really big projects.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does a regular day look like for you there?</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
I get this question all the time, and people ask me, what&#8217;s my routine? &#8220;What&#8217;s your day like?&#8221; And I like to really control my daily routine. And I&#8217;ll explain that a little bit more, is I had this routine&#8230; And I&#8217;ve been actually doing this for years, even before Forum One. I like to come in every morning&#8230; Well, when I used to go into the office. I do this at home remote now full time, but I do the same thing. I come into the office or my office space and I don&#8217;t check email, I don&#8217;t check Slack or any messages first thing in the morning. I like to take that time where it&#8217;s the most quiet part of my day and just look at inspiration. I might do a tutorial because you never stopped learning. I dedicated that quiet space to writing positive influences, positive inputs, inspiration. And I just like to spend that time with myself, maybe even meditate. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been doing more recently just to clear my head. And I found that that&#8217;s really made me a much clearer thinker, a much sharper creative. That&#8217;s my routine.<br>
Now, as the day progresses, and you might know this as well, when you&#8217;re in the thick of it in the agency world, you start to get the pings from the emails later in the day, and so I try to just approach my day very organized. I organize my calendar at the end of the week each week, and then I think about the week ahead.<br>
And the first thing I do after, say, about 10:00, 11:00, I&#8217;ll usually have some meetings. We have a pretty big meeting culture at Forum One so you&#8217;ve got to really be mindful of that and make sure you&#8217;re balancing out your calendar. And all in all, it&#8217;s a pretty chill place in terms of some of the other places I&#8217;ve been where you&#8217;re really in this hustle and grind. There&#8217;s a lot more balance, I find, at Forum One.<br>
And so my day is spent either in the thick of it, designing, working, or working with other designers. I spend a lot of time mentoring the younger designers on the team. And I have these check-in times with them two times a week. And anybody can book this time with me, and I&#8217;ll review their work, help them with their career. I do a lot of different things as a Forum One mentor at the agency.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk a little bit more about the makeup of your team. You mentioned these younger designers that you&#8217;re working with. What does the team look like?</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
At Forum One, we&#8217;re split where we have designers that are part of the strategy team, and they&#8217;re mostly focused on brand identity brand strategy. And so we have designers there, but we also have a core web team that&#8217;s focused on interactive design. And I sit as an in between those two groups. A lot of my work in my career has been branding, brand development, so I work across the different departments.<br>
Our interactive team is really a combination of user experience designers, UX researchers, and visual designers, kind of like product designers who focus mostly on web. And so there&#8217;s probably about, I think&#8230; Oh, how many of this are there now? Probably maybe 15, so we have a pretty good size team overall. But our divisions, our departments run the gamut from anything from strategy, branding, motion graphics. Animation is something new we&#8217;re doing now, and then web and interactive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds like a pretty big team overall.</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s pretty big team.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If you&#8217;ve got all these separate teams and they&#8217;re doing this different work, when a new project comes in, what does your creative process look like? Walk me through that.</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
We have a centralized resourcing department that really works closely with the managers and the department leads, and so I work very closely with that team to figure out who is working on what. And a lot of this stuff is actually handled by our VP of design because my role is a unique role in the sense it&#8217;s not like a traditional creative director role where I have to oversee everything. Each of our designers gets assigned a project, and it&#8217;s usually based on their interest and&#8230; their role and interest. And so my creative process is, really, I get assigned projects where I&#8217;m either the lead as far as design, maybe I might be leading some of the design or I might be working with another designer where I&#8217;m an art director, creative director working with another designer. Are you thinking walking through the actual process for our project? I can do that as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. Say there&#8217;s a new client that you get or there&#8217;s a new campaign that you have to work on. What does the process look like when you&#8217;re talking about it with your team and everything?</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
Yeah, so a lot of times we&#8217;ll start off with having a creative brief. A lot of times, there&#8217;s a lot of key discovery that happens before we even get assigned a project. Usually when a project comes through, we&#8217;ll have a big team meeting. All the key players who are assigned to the project will be in that first initial meeting. And this is an internal meeting. You would have your developer who might be on the project. And this could be front end and back end developer. You&#8217;ve got your project lead. You might have somebody from the strategy team. You&#8217;ll have a user experience designer, a visual designer, and then sometimes myself in addition to those, as well as a team lead or a creative director. And when that comes in, we really go through the scope of work. We look at all of the things that the client is looking for, and then we start planning when we&#8217;re going to have key discovery workshops where we go in and work with the client.<br>
And the outcome of a discovery workshop really is where we actually&#8230; That&#8217;s where it really starts. We then would put together a creative brief. And this is really just a guiding document that we all follow that really highlights some of the things we learned in discovery, the goals of the project. And really, at that stage, we&#8217;re all figuring out how we&#8217;re going to work together, what areas that I&#8217;m going to focus on versus others.<br>
And then we we all go our separate ways for a little while, and then we set up key review check-ins where we all come back together. Because there&#8217;s a lot of different things in the beginning that are happening, that could be happening. Say it&#8217;s a web project, for example. We&#8217;re going to have user experience that&#8217;s going to be doing interviews. They&#8217;re going to be learning all about the project from the client, but they&#8217;re also going to be interviewing the potential users, really gathering all that data that visual designers would then use to design to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the hardest part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a lot of pressure in being a designer to always have ideas. And you&#8217;re working on so many different things at any given time, and there&#8217;s a pressure, there&#8217;s a pressure to always deliver, always be original, always have a new idea. And I think the biggest challenge is really making sure that you&#8217;re able to stay inspired and stay motivated to keep generating these ideas sometimes really fast timelines. That&#8217;s probably the biggest challenge, but I think that I&#8217;ve developed ways to overcome that, ways to work through it so that it hasn&#8217;t been as a big of a challenge in the last few years as it has been in the past. But I think that&#8217;s a big one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you normally have pretty fast deadlines for projects?</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
We&#8217;ve actually gotten a lot better. It&#8217;s not as much now. We have fast turnaround. And I say fast turnaround, typical project at Forum One is going to be a couple months. We&#8217;re working on large web builds. But those review cycles might be faster depending on&#8230; It really depends on the client, so if it&#8217;s for a conference or something big coming up, then we got faster timelines. Overall, I would say that it&#8217;s not completely chaotic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like you said, you&#8217;ve been at Forum One now for about seven years, so you&#8217;ve really come up through the ranks and seen how, not just the business have grown, but probably how you&#8217;ve grown within the business, right?</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. Well, I think that when you spend a significant amount of time at one place, you start to learn a lot about how that place works, how&#8230; You learn more. You learn the business side, you learn how contracts are acquired. And I&#8217;ve found that I&#8217;ve learned so much more about business just by playing a role in business development, pitching work to clients. And it&#8217;s been a great experience in the sense that I get to learn more than just visual design. And I get to learn the different areas of how to run a business and how money is generated and what&#8217;s important to companies to grow, and so that&#8217;s exciting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit, because you&#8217;ve talked a good bit about work, but let&#8217;s learn more about you, about your origin story. And we are going to get to the sauce, in case anybody&#8217;s listening and want to find out more about that. We&#8217;ll get to that, but tell me more about where you grew up. You mentioned Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, we&#8217;ll definitely get to the sauce. My origin story leads to the sauce, so this is going to be good. I grew up in a town called Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Not too many people know of Johnstown, but it&#8217;s a small town and probably about an hour outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I always say that because people seem to know Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh Steelers, football. I grew up in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.<br>
My early days in Johnstown were typical. I had a really good childhood growing up. It really did shape who I was able to become. I spent most of my childhood in my own head. I was always a creative person. I always loved to draw. That was one of the things that I&#8230; If you didn&#8217;t find me on a basketball court, you found me&#8230; I&#8217;d be drawing, because art was always an outlet for me. I have two siblings. I have a younger sister and then I also have a twin brother who is my partner in the barbecue sauce. Growing up was typical childhood. I had a really good upbringing, family life. I had some good influences.<br>
But I always like to say that it wasn&#8217;t all sunshine growing up. There were some negative influences coming up. And I&#8217;ve had family members struggle with alcoholism, drugs, and those things shaped me. Because I didn&#8217;t have a lot growing up, we were shielded from the fact of what the circumstances were in our home life. My parents worked really hard, and I always just think back. And I think about my mother, who cleaned houses. And when I look back and I think about my childhood, I was really shielded from what was really going on.<br>
And we had nice things. We had Christmases and we had all these things, but I just know my mother had to work really hard, so that&#8217;s always been something that stuck with me and really played a major role into who I am as a person and what I&#8217;ve been able to become and where I got this drive to just really work hard. And I look at that and I think about that as something that really shaped who I&#8217;ve become.<br>
And the other side is I grew up in a very foody family. Family dinners, big meals we&#8217;re a big part of our life, so food has always been a constant thing: barbecue, cookouts, all these different things. And my brother and I just would&#8230; We&#8217;d love to cook. We were very entrepreneurial growing up. But we would sell candy at school or sell pizza season. Me and my brother would make our own season blends with whatever we had in the cabinet, we would take it to school and we would sell to the other kids because we ate school lunch, and school lunch isn&#8217;t always that good. I always remember us making things. We were different, but we were always creative in that way, and so that guided me into this self-discovery about what I really wanted to do, which I can get into too, if you want to dive into that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s get into it.</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
I never really knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. Of course, I played sports growing up. I played football for a little while, and then I really latched onto basketball. I&#8217;m not a very tall person, but I had these dreams of playing in the NBA, and that quickly faded. I realized I&#8217;m not getting any taller, but also, it wasn&#8217;t something that was&#8230; I wasn&#8217;t a breakout star in my town or anything like that. But I enjoyed the game, the team, camaraderie, and I always enjoyed sports in that way.<br>
Growing up, as I got older, got into high school, I really started to think about what the heck I wanted to do. I&#8217;ve always had this drawing ability, had a deep passion for food, and so my brother, he actually was thinking about becoming a chef, and he did become a chef. And so we would talk about together, was like, &#8220;Well, maybe we should go to school together and we&#8217;d be a chef, and you could be a chef too. We&#8217;d be twin chefs.&#8221;<br>
And so while I thought that was a cool idea, I never saw myself working in a kitchen or anything like that. And so I figured, well, what&#8217;s the next thing? What else could I do? And so I&#8217;ve always grew up, like I said, spent a lot of time drawing and really was into art. I excelled really well in art. And so I had this drawing ability, but I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to do with it. It&#8217;s one of those things where nobody says, &#8220;Oh, be an artist. You should be an artist,&#8221; or, &#8220;You should go to school and be an artist.&#8221; It just wasn&#8217;t something that you ever talked about. It&#8217;s usually like, &#8220;Oh, you could go to the military.&#8221; I had some family members who went into the military and had successful careers doing that. But I just didn&#8217;t feel like that was for me.<br>
There was this moment where in my high school art class where a older gentleman came to speak, and he was a commercial artist and he did animation. And I was like, oh, really intrigued by animation and this idea of making cartoons. And I figured, well, I could draw, maybe I should go to school for animation, thinking that, well, that could be a great career, making cartoons. I like to watch cartoons.<br>
That&#8217;s actually what I did. I went to school initially for animation. My brother went off to culinary school. And last minute we were trying to figure out what schools we were going to go to, and we were looking at areas. We looked at Pittsburgh as a neighboring town. And we ended up going to the same school, which is the Art Institute in Pittsburgh. That by chance they had a two year old culinary program, and so we ended up going from being roommates at home to being roommates in college. And he went for culinary and business management, and then I went into their animation program.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You both went to the same school, both went to Art Institute of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
We did, we did.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. What was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
Well, I learned very quickly that I&#8217;m not sure that I want to be an animator. How it went down is I got into the program really based on my ability to draw. That program, you have to do some tests to see how well you can draw and make sure you&#8217;re able to handle the demands of the program.<br>
And I got in there, and I really enjoyed a lot of my courses. I had some great instructors when it came to animation. But really, part of me just couldn&#8217;t shake the fact that I wasn&#8217;t sure that animation was a career that would really allow me to excel in. It just seemed like I didn&#8217;t fit into animation. I just didn&#8217;t feel comfortable. I didn&#8217;t feel like it was a field that was very inviting, certainly to a person of color. I didn&#8217;t see any Black animators or anything like that, and that was important to me. And it is like that in a lot of fields, but I just was concerned that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to make a career out of that.<br>
And so I think it was maybe six quarters in, I decided to change majors to graphic design, and so that&#8217;s what I ended up getting my Bachelor&#8217;s degree in, graphic design. And that&#8217;s when my world opened up. When I learned about graphic design&#8230; And knowing myself, I&#8217;ve always been super curious about all forms of design, just different things, even just going into a store and looking at packaging and seeing the type on it. I never really thought until I got to school and learned what graphic design was that somebody had to make those things. And that really, really inspired me. And I was like, in graphic design, it&#8217;s so broad. You can do logos, you can do packaging design, you can design billboards, but you can also do clothing and apparel design. There&#8217;s so many different things you can do.<br>
My brother and I have always been very entrepreneurial and we&#8217;re always looking at can we make money? Can we really grow? And so I saw the broadness of graphic design as something that I can really dive into that allowed me to really move and be flexible. And I just saw it as the right career move. And it turned out that it was the right move.<br>
And I think that what I love most about my time at the Art Institute is I got a strong foundation in graphic design and visual design, but there&#8217;s also a lot of courses that you can take that were elective like traditional illustration, editorial illustration, and also things like learning Web and Flash; all of those things were a part of that program. And I was able to learn so many different things, but still also hold on to the fact that I&#8217;m an artist. I really wanted to be an illustrator for a long time, really go to illustration, or more of the illustration side of graphic design, but ended up really falling in love with logo design and branding. I steered my career towards doing identity design, and I spent a lot of time really focused on that.<br>
But overall, my time at the art Institute was good. I learned a lot there. The school is actually closed now, and so that&#8217;s unfortunate. And I know a few of the Art Institutes actually closed. I learned a lot. There are some challenges that I can dig into that I encountered towards the end when I was like, okay, it&#8217;s time to find a job. It&#8217;s time to get out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, yeah. Talk about those, because I think we have a lot of students that listen to this show, and some of them are in design schools, some of them aren&#8217;t, but I know that I often will get letters from rising juniors or rising seniors that are trying to figure out what&#8217;s their next step, especially I think in this current climate that we&#8217;re in. But no, talk about that. What were some of those difficulties you ran into?</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
In Pittsburgh, there was a lot of agencies in the Pittsburgh area. And when I was getting to the point where it was time to find an internship, I really felt like I struggled to land an internship. For one reason or the other, I just couldn&#8217;t find an internship. And I watched a lot of designers around me get internships at some of these places.<br>
And so it was random, but I did my own work. I asked around. And sometimes if you&#8217;re not given a opportunity but you always have the power to go find your own opportunity. I took my career, I would say at that time, in my own hands and I started asking around other agencies, other students and peers. And the funny thing is I worked at Office Max at that time. And it was a office supply store, kind of like a Staples. There was a coworker there, and he mentioned that he had a gentleman that he went to church with who had his own marketing agency. And it was called Bynum&#8217;s Marketing and Communications. And shout out to Russell Bynum, who&#8217;s the founder and owner of that agency. They gave me an opportunity to be an intern, and that experience really was the foundation that shaped my understanding of how an agency worked, how work comes in, how work gets assigned. That was really, really important moment in my career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s so interesting you mention Bynum. Gosh, this is back in maybe 2016 or so, back when Revision Path had a blog and we had writers. And I know we did this series called Black Love by Design. And it was focusing on studios run by Black, married couples, and one of them was Bynum Marketing, Russell and Kathy Bynum.</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
No way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, out of Philly.</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
Oh man, I know Russell and Kathy very well. They gave me an opportunity. It&#8217;s sad that the world works the way it does. And I watched all these students landing these internships, and I&#8217;m like, what&#8217;s the problem here? And that was of those moments that you&#8217;re starting to realize how the world works.<br>
And you can take that to two ways. You can be discouraged by it or you can use it as fuel to really push you through moments. And I used that as fuel for me. It was like, I landed this internship, they gave me the opportunity, and I seized every moment of it. Made sure that when I came in, I really gave them some value. I was bringing a lot of the things that I know to their agency. They were learning from me, I was learning from them.<br>
I haven&#8217;t chatted with Russell in a while, but Russell and Kathy really gave me a springboard to really start that journey off and really give me some real agency experience, because to find a job when you&#8217;re first starting out it&#8217;s like chicken and a egg. You don&#8217;t have enough experience. And then those internships are really, really crucial in helping you land that first job and really being able to get out there and show that you can do the work, because the portfolio is important, but a lot of times it&#8217;s like, well, have you worked at a studio? It could be really tough. But that is such a coincidence.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It is. And shout out to them for, one, being a Black, married couple that&#8230; They&#8217;ve both been working in the industry for well over 30 years, and then them extending the opportunity to you as a Black designer as a place where you can start out your career, that&#8217;s powerful.</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
I remember being so inspired and so amazed because all these agencies are the same; it&#8217;s a couple white dudes who start an agency. And those organizations are just not diverse. And a lot of that, it&#8217;s by design.<br>
And I just remember just being so impressed with what Russell and Kathy were doing, and seeing that really, really made me proud. And so I just wanted to add as much value as I could to that agency. I learned a lot from Russell in that time and be forever grateful for that experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s amazing, that&#8217;s really amazing to hear. And from there, you went on to other roles. I think one of your first really big major roles was senior art director position at GA-1. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
Yeah, so there&#8217;s a couple series of events that led to a little bit before that. There&#8217;s another backstory here that I do want to bring up is I also used to do some freelance for&#8230; Around the time that I did the internship and right after that, a teacher of mine has his own studio called Old Creations in the Pittsburgh area. And he was looking for some freelancers, and so I was able to gain some real world experience there. And at that time, that was something that, along with the internship, I was able to use to land what was my first gig as a designer for a studio called Three PC Media. At the time, it was called Kisco. And they&#8217;re just right on the outside of the Pittsburgh area.<br>
I&#8217;ll tell you the story. What happened was is I got this job. One of the founders actually used to be an alumni of the Art Institute, and he was looking for designers, and so I was one of those designers on the list in working with the departments there to try to help me find a job. And so this is about six months outside of school. And I remember being so excited to just have my first job. I didn&#8217;t even care about the salary. I didn&#8217;t even think about what they were paying me or anything, I was just happy to have a job and learn.<br>
And so I get into that job, and overall it was a great experience. I learned a lot. I spent a good bit of time working for them. And I forget when exactly it was or how long I actually spent there, but I remember one day they came into my office and they were like, &#8220;Hey Corey, we&#8217;re going to have to let you go. We&#8217;re getting a lot of web work, and we&#8217;re not really able to keep you busy. And we could probably afford to give you maybe one more paycheck.&#8221;<br>
And so I was done that day. I was done the day that they came into my office and said that. And it really made me just not upset, but it made me just question myself and my worth. And I remember thinking I did well at every task they&#8217;ve given me. I did really well. And what the thing was is what I didn&#8217;t realize is their business was changing. I didn&#8217;t really recognize it. I did mostly print at the time, branding work, and they were starting to move into web design and interactive stuff and I just didn&#8217;t have those skills.<br>
And it taught me a really, really important lesson. What it taught me is that wherever you go, whatever agency you work for, you have to be very aware of how that business makes its money, the things that they&#8217;re working on, and making sure that you&#8217;re always able to add value. And I learned very importantly from that moment that you have to be consistently adding value, because I never wanted to be in a position where I was replaceable.<br>
And so that moment was actually the thing that really lit a fire in me and really opened my eyes that I could have a solid portfolio, I can deliver, I can come in and do the job that I&#8217;m asked to do and still lose my job. Really, that was the spark that I needed to really set my career on fire. I never wanted to give anybody a reason to say that they can get rid of me. I wanted to make myself irreplaceable, and so I really just used that as the fuel, as I was saying earlier, to really just constantly add value, make sure I&#8217;m learning and growing my skills. I just never wanted to be in that position again. That&#8217;s what I did with my career is just I started to really make sure that I&#8217;m always looking at not just the thing that I&#8217;m good at right now, but the things that I could do that would be above and beyond, that would add more value.<br>
And so I went from that experience. They wrote me a really great recommendation, and so I ended up with landing another job shortly after, and I worked that job for a while. And I saw this opportunity in the DC area for GA-1. And I remember thinking again, I worked with Russell and Kathy, and this agency was a multicultural agency, Black owned, husband and wife, and so it reminded me of that experience that I had. And I thought that, wow, this is great. I felt a sense of a belonging, I felt like you&#8217;re going to work with people who are like you.<br>
And I went into that role as a senior art director. And all of the roles that I&#8217;ve had in my career, the roles were a little bit&#8230; the titles were bigger than you normally seeing somebody starting a career out. My first job was kind like they gave me the title lead designer because it was really just two other people in me. I&#8217;ve always had a higher title, but I never really had true mentorship at any of these organizations. When I talk to a lot of designers and who really think that they need to have a mentor and that they need that to grow, and I always tell them, &#8220;You&#8217;re not always going to have access to mentorship in the organizations, but through the web and the network, your mentor could be anybody. You can make up your own mentor through pulling in aspects of people you admire.&#8221;<br>
And it&#8217;s funny, people ask me, &#8220;Well, who are your mentors? And who were some of your mentors coming up?&#8221; And I always say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t really have any mentors. I never really had somebody who was willing to give me their time,&#8221; so I would look at key attributes of people admired. And it could be somebody like Michael Jordan. You look at Michael Jordan, the way he played the game, his dedication, and then you take some of those skills. Or Anthony Bourdain, I was a big food person and I was introduced to the world of food and cooking through him. Rest in peace. And I learned a lot about storytelling and how food is the ultimate connector. And so you pull all these little aspects from people you really admire and you can mold yourself in those images and add those things to who you are and who you want to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I wanted to talk about some of these larger roles that you ended up taking later. You worked at the Borenstein Group for a while. What do you remember from that? What did you learn from those?</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
GA-1 was really the springboard for me understanding a lot more details about how an agency works, how business comes in. I was really heavily relied on in those roles. And I remember just feeling so insecure and a lot of self-doubt in that moment, feeling like I don&#8217;t know if I should be the one leading these meetings. But I felt like I was, as I say, was just dropped into the fire. And it was a lot of responsibility to be an active person in business development.<br>
And mind you, this is early on in my career and I&#8217;m in these meetings talking to stakeholders and running client meetings, and at the same time I&#8217;m just figuring it out and trying to become a better designer. It was a lot of pressure to be able to come in, make sure that I&#8217;m adding value, but at the same time still growing and following my interest in different areas of design. And I&#8217;ve always been really, really curious, I&#8217;ve always been self-motivated, and I love to learn. I just love to try to do new things, and so it&#8217;s balancing that with the needs of the agency and the day-to-day grind of the agency life. GA-1 was that foundation of really understanding how an agency works.<br>
And a little bit later, then I end up going to work at the Borenstein Group where I held similar director titles, but it&#8217;s where I first started really changing from this print first designer to this web first designer and web and interactive. Because a lot of the work we did at the Borenstein Group, it was branding work, but it was branding and website work.<br>
Later on, more towards the end of that, working at the Borenstein Group, we hired a new director who really was a big time mentor, one of my first design mentors who taught me all about the web industries. His name is Joe DePalma. And he actually runs a creative studio called Punch that&#8217;s in the DC area. I think you&#8217;re in Arlington. But that was the first person to really spend some time really showing me how things worked, how web works, how to work with code, and all these different things that just was completely new to me.<br>
But that was a crucial thing that I needed to learn because everything around me was changing. We were moving out of print first, we were moving into more interactive. And user experience was starting to become a really big thing. I learned a lot about how to design for a wider range of medium types.<br>
At Borenstein Group, I was able to dive into a lot of different things. I was able to not only do print and branding work but interactive websites, and also, I got to work on an actual game for the iPhone. And it was like me going into the vaults of my background and animation classes. It was an agency promotional thing. The game was called Turtle Soup. I don&#8217;t think it exists on iTunes anymore, but the game was centered around this turtle was the mascot, and he would be racing through the DC area, and along the way&#8230; It&#8217;s like a racing game. And along the way, there&#8217;s these little icons like social media. And really, what it was was a self-promotional tool for the agency to use to promote itself to say, &#8220;Hey, you can use these other forms of media to really grow your impact and grow your brand using social media.&#8221;<br>
Every day was different. You got to do so many different things. But I was also able to really refine my skills in working with clients. The funny thing is when I started that experience, I went from GA-1 where I&#8217;m leading client presentations and meetings, and then I go to this Borenstein Group where, for a while I wasn&#8217;t pitching, I wasn&#8217;t even talking to clients, I was behind the scenes for a little bit. I just remember really thinking about that and wondering, okay, no problem leading these client presentations. And why wasn&#8217;t I given the opportunity? I thought a lot about that.<br>
And one day, I was able to do a presentation. It was a large board meeting and we were presenting some branding work. The gentleman was like, &#8220;I&#8217;d love to hear what Corey has to say.&#8221; And that was the first time I got what I called a speaking role. At that time, I really knew branding in and out. I love branding. I could talk about it all day. I really sold the project. I remember the guy saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where you got him from, but keep him forever.&#8221; Then all of a sudden, now I&#8217;m in every meeting, I&#8217;m in every presentation. Once again, I had to prove myself.<br>
And I just feel like I&#8217;ve been in all of these agencies and I&#8217;ve always felt this pressure, like I&#8217;ve got to prove my worth and prove myself, prove that I deserve to be in the room. And it&#8217;s a stressful place to be in to always feel like you&#8217;ve got to really show your worth, because going from being laid off, there was already some insecurity starting to brew up. I can&#8217;t give anybody a reason to lay me off again. I can&#8217;t get fired. And so I took that everywhere I went, and I tried to keep making sure I was making a dent, making value. And so finally being able to do a presentation, it was like, okay, I don&#8217;t have to worry about that one thing anymore, I can now continue to keep adding value.<br>
And this is one of the things I always tell young designers is you want to get in these organizations, try to make yourself irreplaceable. When you see a gap, try to fill that gap, always looking for ways to show that you deserve to be in the room. And you do deserve to be in the room, and I think that you just got to always make sure you&#8217;re mindful of the business and how you&#8217;re adding value to that business. Yeah, great experience, learned a lot, ups and downs, but I was able to really, really start to hone my abilities as a creative director, really learning how to better communicate and better collaborate with those around me. That all came in my time, working at the Borenstein Group.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you still feel that way now?</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t feel it as much. I can&#8217;t shake the feeling that somebody&#8217;s always watching. I still feel it to an extent, and I don&#8217;t know what it is, but I&#8217;ve always had this lingering feeling no matter where I went that I just have to prove myself. I always feel like everybody&#8217;s watching me, that they&#8217;re just waiting for me to fall or waited for me to fail or do something wrong. This is really just of a me. And that burnt me out for a while, too.<br>
I should say through all that advice of really making sure you&#8217;re showcasing your value, make sure you&#8217;re really feeling, you got to be careful not to burn yourself out. And I did do that a few years back. Just I&#8217;ve had this mentality of always being on, always being available. And really, it&#8217;s just not healthy, and really, that&#8217;s born out of toxic environments where there&#8217;s this expectation for you to always be on. And a good bit of my career, it was like that. The places I was in, they were go, go, go, and you always had to feel like you needed to be available, you needed to be on, on call, working on the weekends and those things. And I remember just doing it, just going with the flow and just taking it as it is. And just thinking that, okay, this is normal. And I realized, and now looking back in retrospect that those environments aren&#8217;t normal. It isn&#8217;t normal to work that way.<br>
Now at Forum One, it&#8217;s different. There wasn&#8217;t that expectation to always be on and always be available. And I found that here, people are working the standard shift, they&#8217;re 9:00 to 5:00. And that was so foreign to me. I just didn&#8217;t understand that. I had never seen that before, and so I found it just great to be able to take a step back from this way I was used to working that was really ultimately leading me to be burnt out. And so I just feel so much more balanced. Now I&#8217;m really enjoying the work. And I don&#8217;t know how it was for you coming up. I do feel like balance is really, really key. And I think that I&#8217;m in a much better place now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Certainly, I think trying to find a good balance between work and just trying to live your life is certainly important. I think it was different for me because I had my own studio for a number of years, for roughly nine years. From 2008 to 2017, I was running my own studio. And I didn&#8217;t have any business mentorship or anything, at least at the beginning during that time to let me know what the balance could look like. It was the running joke that I used to say is, &#8220;Oh, as an entrepreneur, you can work half days, any 12 hours you like.&#8221; I would work just day in, day out, wouldn&#8217;t stop. And I did it because, yes, I had the freedom to make my own schedule, but it wasn&#8217;t something that became sustainable, especially once I started growing in business, and certainly not once I started building a team. It&#8217;s like, why am I running myself ragged trying to do this? And I need to try to find a way to make that balance.<br>
Now, for the past five years, I&#8217;ve been working for startups, and I&#8217;ve really found a way to compartmentalize my work hours are between this hour and this hour. And anything after that, I don&#8217;t even think about it. I&#8217;m moving on to whatever other stuff that I have to do. Some of it is just really staking those boundaries and really sticking to them.<br>
But yeah, it&#8217;s a struggle. I think everyone has to find a way to come to that balance. There&#8217;s no one true way to do it, because everyone&#8217;s circumstances are different, everyone&#8217;s situation is different. You just have to find what works best for you. But I think what we can all know is that working too much in that respect will lead to burnout. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely. These are just things that you learn along the way. And I&#8217;ve learned a lot along the way. And I talk a lot about understanding and knowing the businesses that you work within. Like I talked about, me and my brother, we were always entrepreneurial. And so the barbecue stories, we bypassed the barbecue story, but I&#8217;ll jump back to it real quick.<br>
What happened was my brother ended up going into this culinary program. And I&#8217;m in the graphic design program, or switching from animation to graphic design. He starts really learning a lot of different sauces and different things. And he had this idea, he was like&#8230; One day he comes to me, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;You know what would be really good? Is a barbecue sauce with coffee. If you think about it, coffee has this roasted smokey flavor. Barbecue has that same character. You know what&#8217;d be cool is if we made a coffee infused barbecue sauce.&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;You&#8217;re in graphic design, you can make the label.&#8221;<br>
And that&#8217;s literally how it went down. And he was like, &#8220;You can make the label.&#8221; And so he did all the groundwork. He did all the research into how to get it packaged, how to get the label, the nutritional facts, UPC bar coding, how all this stuff works. He just went out and started researching it, and then we collaborated together. The bottle we have now is a few iterations from what it was. I can&#8217;t even look at the first label. I was just like, &#8220;Oh, did I design that?&#8221; I can&#8217;t believe I designed that.&#8221;<br>
We&#8217;ve been doing the sauce for, oh man, I want to say almost 20 years now. It&#8217;s so funny because it was back in college. We started this back in college. And jonesenbbq.com for those who are interested. This is something we did together. And having your own brand and your own business is really&#8230; that was the after hours learning. I&#8217;m at work and I&#8217;m looking at agencies, I&#8217;m seeing how agencies work and the business side of agencies, but at home I&#8217;m starting a sauce business, a product business, and I&#8217;m learning all about how to sell products and building my own website in my free time trying to figure out how to build my own website.<br>
And so I&#8217;m after hour is really working on this has been our passion project. And we do well with it. It&#8217;s one of those things, if you want things to do well, you have to put more energy into it. But he and I are both career focused. My brother, he&#8217;s a chef. And now he actually is transitioning to&#8230; He just moved to the Atlanta area. He&#8217;s working on some things with a partner down there and really trying to do some interesting concepts, food trucks, and all that.<br>
He was also on the Food Network four times, and won I think three times, he won three times. That&#8217;s his of claim the fame there. And so he and I, we&#8217;re always running in different circles, but we&#8217;re still similar in the sense that we both are really grinding in our own respective areas. And so the barbecue sauce is that one common ground where we come together and work on stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, very cool, very cool. I want to talk about your YouTube channel. This is something I think you started maybe a couple of years ago called Creative Director Studio. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
Well, yeah. And I&#8217;ll tell you how that came to be. I always had this mentality for a long time that nobody really cares what I have to say, that nobody was listening. And I realized that that&#8217;s just not true. And the reality is there are people watching, there are people listening. And no matter what stage you are in your career, there&#8217;s always going to be somebody who is a couple steps below you willing to look at&#8230; looking up at you as a mentor, inspired by you. And so I think too many designers out there, or creatives out there often feel self-doubt, but also feel like people aren&#8217;t listening to the things that they have that because they haven&#8217;t won a major award or whatever it might be. Oh, I haven&#8217;t won a major award or an Emmy or anything like that so nobody&#8217;s going to care about what I have to say.<br>
But I realized that in mentoring&#8230; And I mentor a lot of younger designers now. And then also working at Forum One, I&#8217;m a mentor to other designers, and they&#8217;re all looking up at me and they&#8217;re all taking my advice. And really, I found that that might be my passion. I&#8217;ve always been looking for a purpose and passion in this hunger to learn and grow and always adding on new skills to my tool belt.<br>
I&#8217;m a creative director, but I went through extensive training in motion graphics and animation a few years back. And I kept asking myself, I was like, what is this new thing going to do for me in my career? What value am I going to leave? What dent can I make in my career? And is it learning the next new thing? And I realized that it&#8217;s mentorship. I&#8217;ve been so excited to learn that I can really add value to somebody else&#8217;s career. And I just found that to be super inspiring.<br>
And so a coworker or colleague of mine, we&#8217;ve always talked about this for a long time, about starting some channel dedicated to mentorship. And so we decided to partner up to expand our reach and really make sure that we&#8217;re pulling in different perspectives. And so we decided to start the channel, Creative Director Studio, on YouTube. And it&#8217;s been a couple months here now, and we&#8217;re growing. And it&#8217;s a way for me to share what I know, what I&#8217;ve learned along the way. And then hopefully, we can inspire the next generation of leaders, of creative leaders, really by sharing what we&#8217;ve learned just as a way to give back to the community.<br>
And we&#8217;ve got a lot of great plans for the show and thinking about how we&#8217;re going to evolve, if we&#8217;re going to&#8230; What guests we&#8217;re bringing in to speak, and really make sure we&#8217;re broadening in the voices that happen within creative director studio. And so it&#8217;s something we&#8217;re working towards. It&#8217;s really just a live version of what value I&#8217;m giving in my private mentoring sessions when I do those.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does success look like for you at this stage in your career?</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
I think for a long time, I was focused on winning awards and doing these different things. And I&#8217;ve won someone along the way. I spent a lot of time working with the Smithsonian African American museum. I led to visual design of that. We won some Webby Awards for that. And I was able to win some really good awards in my career. And for a long time, I thought that that was the thing that I wanted as my success metric, and I realized that that&#8217;s not it.<br>
For me, success is what I&#8217;m doing to give back and who I&#8217;m lifting up along the way. I am now focused more on mentoring, other designers, mentoring designers, who are like me, look like me. I believe that success is how many people I bring along the ride with me. What can I do with this position I&#8217;m in to lift up those around me and make sure that I&#8217;m giving back to the creative community, giving back to those of color in design and showing them that they have somebody there to support them and there&#8217;s people out there willing to dedicate that time to mentor you?<br>
I didn&#8217;t have a lot of mentors, as I said, and so I can be of the mentor that I didn&#8217;t have. And so I used the channel, but I also used mentorship as an opportunity to do that. And I think, honestly, I would be happy with my career if I was just able to be that spark in somebody&#8217;s career. If I could just do that, if I could just keep doing that, inspire one person, go to the next person, then to the next person and really, really make sure that I&#8217;m just giving back to the community. To me, that&#8217;s success enough.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want your next chapter to look like?</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
I am enjoying being a creative director in and leading projects. I&#8217;m seeing myself diving into just new forms of design. I&#8217;m really excited by the new tech coming out. And there&#8217;s all this buzz around AI generated creative. I always live and thrive in that area of curiosity, so anything new that&#8217;s coming out, I&#8217;m on it. I&#8217;m willing to dive in and learn. It&#8217;s hard to say; five years is a long time from now, so I see myself diving into some new tech and really diving into just really bigger and better or more&#8230; I should say more innovative ideas. I see myself heading in that direction.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work, about the sauce? Where can they find all that online?</p>
<p><b>Corey Jones:</b><br>
On social media, I&#8217;m on Twitter. I use Twitter most for the most part. I&#8217;m @coreycreative. You can find me at Corey Creative also on LinkedIn. The barbecue sauce is jonesenbbq.com. Try it out. The best sauce you never tried. And you can also check me out on my YouTube channel at Creative Director Studio. Yeah, that&#8217;s where you can find me. I&#8217;m always willing to work with people, mentor people, so if those of you out there are looking for mentorship and you need somebody to help you with your career, you can also find me on LinkedIn. Feel free to reach out, happy to connect with anybody.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Corey Jones, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I think probably what stands out the most to me from hearing your story and hearing about all of the things that you&#8217;re working on is that you&#8217;re someone that has drive. And I think that&#8217;s rare nowadays because there&#8217;s so much that&#8217;s available to&#8230; For a designer that wants to start out now, you&#8217;ve got classes, you&#8217;ve got LinkedIn, you&#8217;ve got YouTube, you have so much stuff that you may not even have the passion to really become a great designer unless you really have that drive. And it sounds like you&#8217;re someone that has just always had that motivation to strive and do more and be better. And I think that&#8217;s something that we can all really get inspired by. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>

<p>Avid listeners of the podcast know that whenever I have a Black design educator on the show, eventually I&#8217;m going to bring up my alma mater, Morehouse College. And while I&#8217;ve had a few Morehouse alums on the show in the past, I&#8217;m really excited to have an actual Morehouse faculty member &#8212; Dr. Perry Sweeper &#8212; as a guest this week. Has Morehouse leveled up since I was a student there *cough cough* years ago?</p>
<p>After a quick summer check-in, we talked about Morehouse&#8217;s software engineering major, and about how it feels teaching at a school with such a historic reputation. From there, Dr. Sweeper told the story about growing up in Baltimore, attending Morgan State University, and how his post-grad career led him into education. With great minds like Dr. Sweeper teaching the next generation, I think we&#8217;re going to be in good hands for the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Hi. My name is Dr. Perry Sweeper. I&#8217;m a Professor of Practice at Morehouse College. I&#8217;m a designer, an educator, and a researcher.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is a Professor of Practice? What does that mean?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
So there are different levels at universities. There are Adjunct Professors, who maybe teach one or two classes. There are also people who are on the tenure track, who might be in the Assistant Professor ranks. A Professor of Practice, by my definition, is someone who comes in from industry to teach a particular class or classes for a university.<br>
And one of the benefits of having someone in a Professor of Practice role, is they&#8217;re someone who&#8217;s both working in industry and academia at the same time, so they can give you a right now experience, from the perspective of a person working in the field, for the students.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. That makes sense. So it&#8217;s not like someone that&#8217;s a career academic essentially?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Correct.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. All right. I got you. I was thinking, I know that there&#8217;s some trade schools I know that do that. I think the art institutes do that as well. They&#8217;ll have people who are actually working professionals, but then they also will teach courses and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So how&#8217;s the summer going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
It is busy. It&#8217;s really busy. It&#8217;s good. I&#8217;m going to try to take some time to rest before classes start in a couple of weeks, but it&#8217;s going well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are you ready for the upcoming school year?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Yes. I am. I&#8217;m ready to talk to students again, interact with students again. I have some things that I want to do as far as the syllabus is concerned or the curriculum, some tweaks I want to make, but other than that, I&#8217;m fully prepared and ready to go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Speaking of school, you teach at Morehouse College, and listeners of this show know I am an alumnus of Morehouse College. You started in the 2021 school year. I&#8217;m just curious, how has it been teaching during the pandemic?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
It has been extremely interesting because you have to be agile and flexible, and in your work role, in the way that you assign, you also have to be transparent as well and you have to be empathetic to what&#8217;s going on with the students. So during that time, I tried to make sure that I was thinking about what was going on and also trying to get a cadence of where the students were physically, mentally, and emotionally because some of them were stuck at home and not able to come to campus, or they came to campus and they had to leave. There were so many different things going on personally with the students, so it was a really, really interesting time. I think it is actually a time where it felt like we were really, really far apart, but I think it brought the campus community closer together in a way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now you haven&#8217;t been to the campus yet though, have you?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
No, I haven&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, you got to come down to Atlanta and come to the campus. I don&#8217;t live that far from Morehouse actually.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Oh, awesome. Yeah, I actually visited the Morehouse campus years ago, probably 10 or 15 years ago, but I haven&#8217;t been there since.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Morehouse is a college that has a distinct history, so I&#8217;ve heard a lot about it, read a lot about it. It&#8217;s actually an honor to be able to teach at the school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s changed a lot since I graduated certainly, which is, my God, knocking on 20 years ago. Oh, my God, I just thought about that. I just did the math. I mean, the campus has changed a lot in terms of they&#8217;ve expanded in some ways. There&#8217;s a performing arts center now. They&#8217;ve got campus apartments and things like that. I think even the building where&#8230; You&#8217;re in the Computer Science Department I think pretty much, right?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Correct, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So even the building where that is used to be&#8230; When I was there, the computer lab and all that stuff used to be in Wheeler, but you haven&#8217;t to campus, so you don&#8217;t know this. There used to be a Wheeler Hall, which is right near the entrance of Morehouse, and then they built the Technology Tower, which is where they moved it, which is kind of near Sale Hall and near Graves Hall, which is kind of near the big lawn on Morehouse&#8217;s campus, the great lawn on Morehouse&#8217;s campus. It&#8217;s nice if you get a chance to check it out. Actually, I don&#8217;t know if this is true, but you&#8217;ll have to tell me, does Mrs. Banks still work there?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Mrs. Banks?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
What&#8217;s the first name?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Martha. She&#8217;s the Administrative Assistant for the Computer Science Department.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
I almost remember her retiring.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, man.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the right person, but I&#8217;m not a good person to ask when it comes to&#8230; I know interacting with the department, I haven&#8217;t had a chance to interact with her.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
She was like my mom on campus. I was a math major, so most of my stuff was in Dansby I believe. I&#8217;m trying to remember the names of the dorm now that I&#8217;m thinking about it, or the names of the buildings. I think most of my stuff was in Dansby, but I was doing work study stuff, so I would always be in the computer lab. I would always be in Mrs. Bank&#8217;s office at the desk and everything. I don&#8217;t know if she still works there. I mean, I would imagine 20 years from now, probably not, because I think she had been there probably since the &#8217;80s when I started, so I don&#8217;t know.<br>
If she is still there, shout out to Mrs. Banks, who has been helping a generation of Black male technologists pass through that school. She is an unsung hero of Morehouse College.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Wow. While we&#8217;re shouting out Ms. Banks, who I&#8217;m going to look up by the way, we have to shout out all of the Administrative Assistants who were like moms and aunts at HBCUs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
There&#8217;s always one. When you&#8217;re talking about Ms. Banks, I&#8217;m thinking of Ms. Brown. I&#8217;m thinking of countless others, and Ms. Ash in my experiences at HBCUs, so that&#8217;s really interesting to hear you talk about her.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s talk about some of the courses that you&#8217;re teaching. What are you teaching at Morehouse?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Right now I&#8217;m teaching Human-Computer Interaction. Last summer, I also wrote a Data Visualization course as well, and so I&#8217;m looking to teach that very soon.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you were telling me before we started recording that what you&#8217;re doing is kind of&#8230; Or at least the program in which you&#8217;re teaching is not really a department. It&#8217;s like an interdisciplinary studies program. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Yes. It&#8217;s experiential learning and interdisciplinary studies, and so there are various subjects in the department. I think that it&#8217;s a really innovative way to look at education. Morehouse is doing something very interesting as well because they&#8217;ve had some shifts in the way that they have designed their program, and even as I&#8217;m talking, very recently they&#8217;ve changed the structure, the departments, so departments, divisions, chairs, it&#8217;s really going to be more of a STEM-oriented environment, more so.<br>
This will be the first semester that we&#8217;re under that structure, so I&#8217;m looking forward to that as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Can you major in Design at Morehouse? I would imagine with this experiential learning and interdisciplinary studies, you can kind of mix and match kind of different fields of study. When I went there, and I&#8217;ve told this story countless times in presentations and stuff, I started at Morehouse in 1999, right around the early days of the web, and I remember telling my Computer Science professor there, Dr. Jones.<br>
I started in a dual degree program doing Computer Science/Computer Engineering, and I remember going to him one day and telling him that I wanted to do Web design. I was interested in Web design. I had been doing view source on websites and stuff, and I told him about it. I remember him telling me that the Internet was a fad, and that if I wanted to study that, I would need to change my major because that&#8217;s not what we study here. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;We do hardcore computer science. We&#8217;re learning assembly. We&#8217;re teaching you how to be a programmer.&#8221;<br>
I wanted to be a programmer, but just not, I guess, a computer programmer. I wanted to do Web design, and so I did end up changing my major, but I&#8217;m wondering now, since Morehouse went through all these shifts in curriculum and programs as you mentioned, is it possible now to major in design there?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
No, it&#8217;s not. There is an Art Program, and then there&#8217;s a Computer Science Program. So a lot of the students that I actually teach in Human-Computer Interaction are Software Engineering majors.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
And so you won&#8217;t get the design part, but my background is design, so I teach Human-Computer Interaction from a design standpoint or a UX-design standpoint because the fields are so closely knit. When you look at industry, typically when you look at the waterfall method of software design, you get an idea, you make it, and you give it to the users, and that&#8217;s it. Then you have agile and other methodologies where you&#8217;re constantly iterating on the design and speaking to users as you go along, so that what you actually produce is something that the users will actually want and need for what they&#8217;re doing.<br>
So it&#8217;s really interesting to interact with computer science students and engineers because I take pride in bringing this perspective to them and teaching them about psychology and teaching them about doing interviews with your users and finding out about them and learning about the environment that those users are working in, whether they&#8217;re going to be looking at a computer screen for a very long time and they might need dark mode, or just a lot of different things. So it&#8217;s almost like looking at anthropology or ethnography and really getting to know the users.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s really interesting that Morehouse has kind of branched out in that way. I mean, I knew that they had the art major, and I don&#8217;t know if they have any more art professors because the one professor they had I remember, Dr. Anderson, I believe he passed away. I&#8217;m pretty sure they might have another art professor now if they still have the major, but I often get asked from people when I tell them I went to Morehouse and because I&#8217;ve been a working designer for so long, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, did you major in design?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;No, I majored in math,&#8221; and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;What? How&#8217;re you a designer and you didn&#8217;t go to design school?&#8221;<br>
That&#8217;s interesting. I would like to see Morehouse still have some kind of a design discipline of some sort because I feel like it&#8217;s something that the school is really greatly missing. I mean, they&#8217;ve got music. They&#8217;ve got so many other things. I just feel like one day, and I&#8217;m saying this probably partially out of vanity because I would like to come back and speak at Morehouse one day, but I can&#8217;t really speak to the Math Department because I don&#8217;t do math and I can&#8217;t speak to the Computer Science Department because I don&#8217;t do computer science, so yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
We can make that happen now. We can make it happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Let&#8217;s talk about that offline then. We&#8217;ll confer about that.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s actually a desire of mine to one day see a design program at Morehouse as well, and so we&#8217;ll see how far we get that in the next five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has it been teaching at such a well known institution? Do you feel any kind of pressure or anything?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, Morehouse is looked at&#8230; As far as males and Black colleges and excellence and all of the alumni and graduates who are doing great things out there, it&#8217;s a lot of pressure as a professor because I&#8217;m not a Morehouse Man, but I take pride in having a hand in the education of a Morehouse Man. So being able to understand the history and the distinction behind it is, I think, integral in being a part of the campus in a way, and when I say the campus, I mean just the academic cadre of folks that are there.<br>
I haven&#8217;t gotten to interact with certain professors there, like Dr. Muhsinah Morris, who&#8217;s doing Morehouse in the Metaverse, or the Metaversity. I&#8217;m teaching on Zoom, but in the next year or two, I want to transition to VR headsets and looking at a hybrid way to kind of teach on that campus, and she has been just integral in making sure that that happened during the pandemic. It&#8217;s just amazing to see that grow at the university as well.<br>
We had the COVID and all of that. It&#8217;s terrible some of the things that happened during that time, but it&#8217;s just a great opportunity for innovation in academia.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I know last year&#8217;s commencement took place in the metaverse. I got an email about that. I was like, &#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t that something?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Yeah. It is. Actually it&#8217;s a direction we want to go in. We are partnering with different EdTech companies and trying to make sure that we are looking at education in a different way and making it available to more students.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, if you&#8217;re looking for some Black folks that are doing stuff in the metaverse, I can certainly introduce you to a few we&#8217;ve had on the show before.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Absolutely. Yeah, definitely. I would love to get those recommendations, and I will comb through it myself and look at it because your podcast is basically a place to go for research at this point. So I&#8217;ll definitely do that homework, and I&#8217;ll look at those recommendations.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s the rest of the department like? Have you had a chance to work with any other professors? Or talk with any other professors?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Yes. So the Division Chair, Dr. Kinnis Gosha, he&#8217;s been just integral in my development. He&#8217;s the one who posted the job, and so getting an opportunity to speak to him. He&#8217;s at the university. He&#8217;s an Endowed Professor, so he is been at the university for a while, and he runs the Culturally Relevant Computing Lab there, and so they&#8217;re doing some really interesting projects around Black male initiatives and technology. So being able to speak to him and Dr. Morris as well has been great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well man, you got to come down to the campus. I think you&#8217;ve got to come and spend at least a week on campus. Go to Crown Forum, see the King statue, definitely got to eat at Chivers. Got to eat at Chivers.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You got to go through the Technology Tower. You got to go see the view of the grass. Don&#8217;t walk on the grass, that&#8217;s the one thing. There&#8217;s a big great lawn in front of Graves Hall, which is the main&#8230; When you see the Morehouse logo, that building, that&#8217;s Graves Hall. It&#8217;s a dormitory. Don&#8217;t walk on the lawn, it&#8217;s supposed to be bad luck. Especially if you didn&#8217;t go to Morehouse, it&#8217;s supposed to be bad luck. People play soccer on that lawn sometimes, but that was 20 years ago. I don&#8217;t know what it is like now. But you got to go and experience really not just Morehouse, but experience the AUC.<br>
You said that you&#8217;ve been to Morehouse before though, right? Didn&#8217;t you say came here several years ago?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Yes. So I came to Atlanta. I saw the campus. I saw some of the campus. I saw a lot of Dr. King monuments and different artifacts. So I&#8217;ve been down there, but it&#8217;s been a while. During the pandemic, I planned it once, and then, &#8220;Oh, COVID is high,&#8221; and it&#8217;s all these different things. So it&#8217;s been up and down, but I feel it. How can I teach at the university and not actually step on campus? I just feel I have to make it happen. I have to do that. Even if you do it virtually and you walk around campus with some Oculus VR headsets on, I got to go and look at some of these things that you&#8217;re referring to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, man. I&#8217;m telling you the AUC in the spring is lit. I mean, the Strip, which is this promenade. It&#8217;s mostly Clark Atlanta, but it connects Clark Atlanta, Morehouse, and Spelman. It kind of connects us together. I mean, in the springtime, I might be looking at this through filtered 20-year-old rose-colored glasses, but man, I&#8217;m telling you, springtime on the Strip is like none other. It&#8217;s paradise, just a cavalcade of positive Blackness as far as the eye can see.<br>
People talk about a different world, and Hillman, which of course is based off of Morehouse and Spelman, it&#8217;s very much like that. Especially when Spelman opens up, and they have Market Fridays and you get to see Lower Manley and the steps and everything. Oh, it&#8217;s such an experience. I have pictures from that time because I was a photographer. Back then, I called myself a photographer, I had a digital camera. I just look back at that time like, &#8220;Oh, man. We were so young, just so crazy.&#8221;<br>
It was such a wild time, and it&#8217;s funny because some of us now have went on to do great things in the world. The current Mayor of Birmingham, Randall Woodfin, we were in the same graduating class, in the same class.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:21:47].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So it&#8217;s really interesting. I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s funny because like I said, I don&#8217;t live that far from Morehouse. I don&#8217;t really go there because I don&#8217;t have a need to as an adult 20 years out of college, but it is right there in the neighborhood. It&#8217;s just good to know that it&#8217;s there and it&#8217;s still kind of doing great things in the community. So what do you learn from your students? What do they teach you?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Well, I had this project during COVID, and it was my attempt&#8230; So let&#8217;s go to Black Panther for a second. I&#8217;m super excited. November is coming, so we&#8217;re going to get&#8230; But there is this scene in Black Panther where they&#8217;re there and they go back, and they want to give this new technology to the United States, I perceive it as, that they&#8217;ve never seen before. You have the little kids, and they&#8217;re like looking at what looks like to them a spaceship or crazy looking car and this new technology, and their idea was to bring this innovative technology into this urban environment and see how it could improve.<br>
So I thought about that in one of the projects that I gave. So the way that the course works, you learn the principles of the human-computer interaction during the first half of the semester, and as you learn those principles, you get small projects, but the students gain an understanding of what human-computer interaction is.<br>
Then during the second part of the semester, they start putting those things into practice. So the project was to come up with a piece of technology that would be needed in a community like that, and I framed it based on that part of Black Panther. Just some of the projects that came out of that, so what did I learn from them? I learned where their minds are, where their focused at. I was just so, not surprised because I know they&#8217;re all bright students there, they teach me that all semester, but to see just a small example of the contribution that some of these students can make and will make in society, it&#8217;s amazing.<br>
Some of the projects they came up with, for instance, was this one-line encyclopedia or anthology. So in 2020 and 2021, there are all kinds of things going on in the news and so forth and so on, so if you had to have a conversation or talk to someone about what was going on, a lot of people didn&#8217;t want to talk about it. Others wanted to talk about it, but they didn&#8217;t know how.<br>
And so one of the students came up with this version of an online encyclopedia or resource, where it had all of these resources on things that were going on racially in the community, how to talk about it, different resources, and so he put his time into it. It&#8217;s a human-computer interaction class, so you don&#8217;t have to code it, but he went the extra mile and actually coded the site and put it up and running. Their projects, they always just blow me away, some of the things that they come up with.<br>
So in the AUC, as you know, there&#8217;s Morehouse, Clark Atlanta, and Spelman, so I&#8217;ve had an opportunity to interact with Clark Atlanta students and Spelman students as well. I had a very large group of Spelman students in my class last semester, and it was just excellence. All of the projects, they were always on point. No matter what was going on, they were active in class, asking questions, so forth and so on.<br>
They really, really teach me the greatness of this generation. In society we can go and look and say, &#8220;Oh, these kids don&#8217;t know anything about music and they&#8217;re doing this or doing that,&#8221; like generations before, but to see just excellence from the students is extremely encouraging.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I have a feeling that Spelman students are probably pretty good. I mean, probably better than Morehouse students, and I say that not out of rank comparison, but I keep bringing this back to my time there because that&#8217;s such a easy reference for me to pull from. But I mean, I went through a summer program before I started my freshman year, and I mean, the women at Spelman were just leaps and bounds above the guys at Morehouse. We were in a similar program. It was a NASA-funded program. I mean, just leaps and bounds. It was amazing, so I can only imagine.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Yeah. They&#8217;re exceptional.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So let&#8217;s kind of switch gears here and learn more about you. Let&#8217;s learn more about your origin story. Tell me where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
So I grew up in Baltimore City, and I grew up not too far from Morgan State University where I later went to school. So as a kid growing up in Baltimore City, all the schools I went to were less than five miles apart. We call it Smalltimore here because it seems like you know someone who knows someone else, and you end up being related to folks that you didn&#8217;t know you were related to, or people know your parents and different things like that. So I grew up in Baltimore, Smalltimore. I didn&#8217;t know about design growing up, but I loved art, and so I grew up getting Disney Adventures magazines.<br>
When I got older, I used to take my allowance and buy Vibes and XXL and Black Enterprise and all of those magazines, and I would really spend a lot of time in the house, dissecting those magazines, finding out who those people were. It got to a point where I was dissecting them. I was looking at them so in depth that I found out who was designing it and what their job titles were. So going from being an artist per se and drawing all the time, I learned about graphic design. I learned about design.<br>
Fast forward to high school, I went to Baltimore City College High School in Baltimore. There was an opportunity at the school to do independent study when you&#8217;re in 12th grade, and so I took two semesters of independent study, drawing, doing artwork, producing a portfolio at that point. That&#8217;s how my career started from that point, learning about graphic design.<br>
As I&#8217;m matriculating at Morgan State University, I got more into my program and started to get more interested in graphic design, I volunteered to work on the yearbook at the university. They were somehow behind in years, so it might have been the year 2003, and they were behind. They hadn&#8217;t given the graduating seniors from the 2001 or 2002 graduating year their yearbooks, so what they did was they contracted us students who had graphic design skills to actually design the yearbook, do all the layout, and make it look like it wasn&#8217;t a yearbook, make it look more like a magazine.<br>
That was our objective, to make this interesting. They&#8217;ve been waiting a really, really long time, let&#8217;s make this good. So for about two or three years, I worked in that office. It was right across the hall from the newspaper office as well, and so before the offices became integrated and it became Student Publications, I worked separately, giving some extra effort to help out with the newspaper and also help out with the yearbook. So while I was learning, I was looking at other opportunities to gain experience while I was on that campus.<br>
It&#8217;s like all of these things just kind of snowballed together because I gained an understanding of publication design and that particular office, the Office of Student Publications, was run by Ms. Denise Brown, who was one of those people that felt like your mother. And if she didn&#8217;t feel like your mother, she at least felt like your aunt, and she ran those offices and we produced those publications. We caught up, and she gave us other opportunities as well. One of the professionals who was helping out with that newspaper actually worked at the Washington Post, so we talked, and he said, &#8220;Keep in touch,&#8221; and I kept in touch with him.<br>
So I graduated and after graduation, I got an email from him saying, &#8220;Hey, we got an opportunity for a person to come and be a Production Assistant at the Washington Post.&#8221; The Washington Post had a Washington Post magazine, and so at the Washington Post, I got to work on that Washington Post magazine, helping to layout those stories that go in it.<br>
I worked in Student Publications, but everybody knows the Washington Post in the States, so it was huge for me to get that opportunity to work there and sit in that room and see news as it happens. Even though I was working on the magazine, I still was in the newsroom or near the newsroom, so I got to see all of that going on. So that is how my story kind of evolved to publication design and graphic design, and I call that my origin story.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s back up because you just took me through 20 years, so let&#8217;s back it up. I get the sense that definitely design was something that you were always into. Clearly you went into that with going into school. I want to hear about what the program was like at Morgan State because you were studying design. I guess this was right around maybe 2001, 2002-ish, something like that when you started?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
I started in 2001, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What was the design program like? Because I didn&#8217;t even know that&#8230; Again, I&#8217;m basing this off my experience with Morehouse, I didn&#8217;t know that any HBCUs even had design programs back then, so tell me what that program was like.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Yeah. Entering into that program, my first couple of years at Morgan I was taking general education classes, so I didn&#8217;t even get to the department until the end of my sophomore year or junior year. I didn&#8217;t really know what was going on, but when I got there, it was in bad shape. They had just let the building actually, and it was leaking and everyone was frustrated and the program didn&#8217;t have much money. It didn&#8217;t have a whole lot of support, and there weren&#8217;t enough professors teaching in it, so I walked into a department that was in chaos.<br>
I think in 2003, they were moved to a brand new building. It&#8217;s called the Murphy Fine Arts Building. So, this was a state-of-the-art building, and it had a performance hall. Morgan is known for its choir. The choir is huge. They tour all over the world. People have successful careers as singers and musicians coming from the Morgan program, and so a lot of that building was built for that department. There were other two other departments there, the Theater Department and it was us, the Art Department.<br>
And so our program was really focused. When you first enter in, they taught you the foundation. Even if you&#8217;re a graphic design major, you&#8217;re taking painting. You&#8217;re taking printmaking. You&#8217;re taking drawing. You&#8217;re taking a couple years of basic design. They want to really make sure that you get an understanding of how this was done before computers really took off, so that was the foundation there. So all of this stuff going on, they didn&#8217;t have money, and then they transitioned to this new building and it felt like a hallway in this huge building.<br>
So although they weren&#8217;t in the position that they were in before, they were in a better position, they still weren&#8217;t where they needed to be. What the department did is they said, &#8220;We need to get a professor in here who knows about graphic design, who can come in here and build this department,&#8221; and so they hired a person named Joseph Ford. He worked on the campus previously in the Public Relations Department, so he had a hand in making sure that all of the publications that needed to go out, graduation, commencement, the Morgan Magazine, he was working on a lot of that. Any branding or logos that needed to be done, he was working on that.<br>
But before he worked at Morgan, he had a successful career in advertising, and he also worked for TV stations doing graphic design for them, so he had an understanding of the campus, and he also had an understanding of the industry. He came to the department and really built the program, so those last couple years he was there, he was teaching basically almost all of the graphic design courses.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Yeah. One professor, and he is really just amazing, what he did with that program. You come to him with a problem, and everybody&#8217;s there and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, we only got this hallway. We got this, that, and the other,&#8221; and he is hearing it, but he&#8217;s focused on making sure that this program and the students get what they need. So what he did was he had some friends in the industry, and he somehow connected them all, and he made a way where famous Black artists got together and they produced a poster for the department. The proceeds from selling this piece of original artwork, and they had print made of it, went to scholarships for students there. Then it went to bringing these particular artists to the university to speak to the students.<br>
And so he was bringing these particular Black artists to the department, raising money. Really, he took the money out of his own pocket, but it&#8217;s the crazy things that professors do to make sure that students have what they need. He supplied everyone that was there with a scholarship to an AIGA membership, and so he gave that to them. He promoted all of the events that they were having at AIGA in Baltimore and the AIGA Nationals, and he really introduced us to the AIGA.<br>
We had no idea what it was as students, and we would go to the particular programs. We got to know the president of the AIGA, he would come to the campus and support what we were doing there. He also had made a connection where the AIGA brought a conference to Morgan State University. I think it was like a portfolio review, and so we got our portfolios reviewed by people in industry. I remember Ellen Lupton was there, a bunch of other professional designers, and so he came up with all these innovative ways. He bootstrapped basically the Graphic Design Program while I was there and graduated.<br>
When we look back on it, a lot of the students there have had successful careers in graphic design. I mean, some of the students have graduated. They work for the NBA. They work for Major League Baseball, doing design. They work for IBM, the Washington Post, the Baltimore Sun. [Ogilby 00:38:38] was included in that, but having their own businesses and doing a lot of things, so we really were a program that started from the bottom, but made something of it. Really didn&#8217;t have much, but made something out of the program/.<br>
And I think I have to give my hat off to him and all the work that he did. I still speak to him a whole lot now, but I have to give him credit for it. The other professors there absolutely, but as far as graphic design is concerned, he was definitely instrumental in making sure that happened.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So after you graduated, you talked a little bit about the Washington Post. You also talked a little bit about going back and working at Morgan State. Now also after school, you kind of ended up going back to school. You went to MICA for a while, and then you went to the University of Baltimore, which is eventually where you got your doctorate at. Kind of tell me about that time. What sparked that decision for you to decide to go back to school?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
There were two points that I want to make. One was when I was early on in my career at Morgan, I remember one of the professors telling me that you could get a Doctorate in Design. I had no idea. So I think that sparked something in me as well because I was like, &#8220;Well, how far can you go in this career as far as education is concerned?&#8221;<br>
The other piece is that the graphic design world, the design world, changed so much. Even throughout college and starting out, it was all about publications. I had a love for publications. And then publications started to fold, and the industry started to go digital. It was convergence, where news reporters were now writing the story, taking the photographs, and almost designing the stories at the same time. Multimedia journalists were coming about, and so I really said to myself, &#8220;I have to learn more.&#8221;<br>
I never really grasped coding a website, and I wanted to learn more about that, so I had a Bachelor of Arts in graphic design and illustration, double major in both of them, and I wanted to learn more about the integration of design. So that&#8217;s why I looked at the University of Baltimore and their program.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And so as you were going through that program, I&#8217;m curious, was it much different from what you were learning at Morgan State? It&#8217;s kind of interesting you kind of started out at an HBCU and then went to a traditional art school with MICA, and then now to University of Baltimore. Was that a big shift, just education-wise?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
It definitely was. So when I went to MICA, I was taking continuing studies courses. I just always had a love for learning. So after I graduated from Morgan, I automatically wanted to learn more, get better at my craft, and the best way I knew how to do that was to go back to school. I was taking digital illustration courses at MICA. Then I saw the program at the University of Baltimore, and they were one of the only programs at the time where you could get a Doctorate in Design. During that time, I think early on, it used to be a Doctorate of Communication Design.<br>
That just brought so much together, what I was interested in with publication design, this integration of various forms of media and producing it, and seeing that program really attracted me to the University of Baltimore and the level of skills. So one of the first classes that you have to take at the University of Baltimore is a class about writing, so you have to write. You have to design the stories at the same time, so that&#8217;s challenging because they want your writing to be just as good as your design.<br>
That&#8217;s what you talk about in the class, and that&#8217;s what you work on. The class was on a Saturday, early in the morning until in the afternoon, so it was a really long class, challenging subject. When I first got there, I really struggled with those first couple of classes because it was a different level. Not to say that the level of education that I got at Morgan wasn&#8217;t high, it was just different at the University of Baltimore. It was pulling different muscles, working different muscles in a different way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now you&#8217;re kind of in a rare echelon of Black design professionals with PhDs. Are there any other peers of yours that you work with or you do research with or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Most of the time in the environments that I&#8217;m in or freelancing, people find out I have a Doctorate in Information Design, and they almost ask the question, &#8220;Why?&#8221; You may get an MFA, and that&#8217;s a terminal degree, but most people, they don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a need for it, so it&#8217;s hard to understand the value of it. I think looking at the way that the different forms of media come together, and then adding a research perspective and understanding design research and understanding more about the user and pulling in these different disciplines, like psychology and anthropology and computer science, I feel like it puts you in a different class with all of those. You have more in your toolbox to add to the environments that you&#8217;re in, and so the peers that I have, sometimes I come into an environment and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; It&#8217;s like intimidation, depending on who I&#8217;m around.<br>
In other environments, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go. Let&#8217;s do this. Bring everything that you have. I&#8217;ll bring my skillset, and we can work together.&#8221; So the cohort of graduates, there are a couple of people that I still talk to that graduated from the program. There are people in the program now that I speak to. There are people in the industry, some people that you&#8217;ve had on this show, that could relate to just that level of education or that thirst for that education, so it&#8217;s a small cohort that&#8217;s growing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at your career now, look back at the span of everything that you&#8217;ve done, what advice would you give to your 16-year-old self?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
I would really say, &#8220;Be fearless. Just be fearless, and do it. Don&#8217;t be afraid of your own greatness.&#8221; I say that because I think about my career and how I walked into some situations timidly that I could have taken more advantage of, that I could have went all in and probably benefited more from it. So I think I would say that, &#8220;Be fearless.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of that, if you knew that you couldn&#8217;t fail in your professional life, what would you try to do?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Wow. I would bring a whole bunch of different things together. I think I would just take all the energy that I have and put it into making sure that as many people who are interested in design in my city, in my sphere of influence, knew about it. They had opportunities. They had internships. They had mentors. They had apprenticeships. They had jobs. I think that&#8217;s what I would do. If I could just do anything, I would probably do what I&#8217;m doing, just at a higher level.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does success look like for you now?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
I think success, to me, looks like not just writing down the idea, but following through and putting action to it. If there&#8217;s success in it, great. If it&#8217;s successful, great. If it fails, I learn from it. So I think success is either it goes really, really well or I learn from it, and both of those are success for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are some projects and things that you&#8217;re working on now?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m really excited about a book. I talk a lot about the program that I grew out of at Morgan, and so I&#8217;m writing a book about that now, the Morgan story basically, and it&#8217;s called Design at a HBCU. It really tells my perspective of what went on there, and so I&#8217;m really, really excited about that. I just started my own studio, and so I&#8217;m at the beginning stages of building that. That&#8217;s called [LADS 00:48:00], and so I&#8217;m really excited about that, a studio practice.<br>
Also, after I graduated from the University of Baltimore with my doctorate, one of the decisions I made was to start an endowment for Visual Arts students, and so far since graduation, we&#8217;ve raised about $10,000, and so I&#8217;m really excited about where we are now and I&#8217;m excited about growing that. So I think in the next five years, I&#8217;d love to see it reach $100,000. That would be awesome to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Overall, what&#8217;s the next step for you? What do you want the next chapter of your legacy to be?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
I want it to be a growing a design studio and possibly entering academia full-time instead of part-time. I&#8217;m really thinking about that. So having a studio practice, interacting with academia on a regular basis, growing that scholarship fund, raising a family. I have two boys and a wife, so that&#8217;s important to me, making sure they get what they need and they grow, and just looking forward to the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m available on LinkedIn under Dr. Perry Sweeper. You can find me there. You can find a website at www.psweeper.com. Send me an email. I&#8217;d love to talk to you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Dr. Perry Sweeper, I want to thank you so much for coming on this show, and I want to just thank you for sharing your story about how you really got into design. I could tell it&#8217;s something that you&#8217;re super passionate about, and the fact that you&#8217;re able to also help to teach the next generation of designers and technologists.<br>
You&#8217;re teaching in that department at Morehouse, but you&#8217;re able to kind of teach the next generation and take your love for design and pass it on to them so they can know that they can make their own mark on the world, just like you&#8217;ve made your mark on the world. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Perry Sweeper:</b><br>
Yeah. Thanks for having me.</p>

<p>When I tell you I have wanted to have this week&#8217;s guest on the show for years? LISTEN. I&#8217;m <em>so</em> glad to bring you this conversation with the one and only Agyei Archer &#8212; typographer, design director, and all-around creative powerhouse.</p>
<p>We touched on a number of different topics, including his brilliant type design work, and how he built two businesses during the pandemic. He also shared how his motivation to succeed comes from his connection to the Caribbean, and talked about how he balances design, tech, his work with Unqueue, and exploring new type design projects. There are a lot of things to fix in this world, but if you&#8217;ve got skills like Agyei, then that just means your next project is right around the corner. Get on it!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
My name is Agyei Archer. I am a designer and entrepreneur currently based in Trinidad. My work extends in a few different branches, one of them is in making typefaces. So I work on typeface design, but primarily with a focus on typeface design, to support the cultures and spaces of the post-colonial slash new world and the global south. And I also, I&#8217;m an entrepreneur in my home country of Trinidad, where I run a design company called Unqueue, where we help small businesses sell online. And we also have a studio called the Unqueue Studio, where we help other startups and institutions, such as government bodies and large corporate entities build their own digital products, to move towards Trinidad&#8217;s digital transformation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I believe your type design was how I first heard about you, like years and years ago. How&#8217;s the summer been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
In the type design world or just in general?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just in general.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been good for me, I started off. I mean, I think it would&#8217;ve been probably in the start of the American summer at Facebook. So I did a talk for Meta&#8217;s OpenArts team. So I gave a talk as part of their visionary series and that was really good, but I think that kicked off my summer. And then I also gave another talk at a conference, called the Eyeo Festival in Minneapolis, that&#8217;s long ago. And those have been really good, I&#8217;ve been really enjoying this particular summer, because I&#8217;ve been so face down in dealing with Unqueue stuff, especially because Trinidad was so locked down for as long as it was. This summer feels like that I&#8217;m becoming an international person again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. So with that in mind, what&#8217;s coming up for you for the next few months?</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Right now we have at Unqueue, which is my startup at home we are working, pretty hard and growing. So we&#8217;ve just started working on connecting a lot of our local population with our local farmers. So we have a massive food import bill in Trinidad, which is wild because we&#8217;re a tropical country that can grow fruits all year round. But we have a massive challenge with people on the ground in Trinidad, purchasing produce from people who are making it in Trinidad. And we have recently built in an addition to our software, that allows local farmers to connect with the general public. So we are currently helping people sell vegetables, and helping farmers direct more organic produce to their shoppers.</p>
<p>And that for me has been my hugest kick, it&#8217;s not as great as writing a massive Python script or anything. But I think that I&#8217;ve been really appreciating recently, especially with Unqueue how much technology can help people on the ground. So that&#8217;s been what I&#8217;ve been mostly excited about, I&#8217;ve been working on that, and I&#8217;ve been working on a new typeface project with Darden Studio.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice. Can you talk about that typeface project?</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Sure. Oh, I forgot, it&#8217;s not recent anymore. So a few years ago, I started working on a typeface that was based on and inspired by the writing styles, that signed to be pervasive across post-colonial spaces. So there was this energy that sign painting and post-colonial spaces came with, that I was trying to see if I could capture into a typeface. And when I say post-colonial spaces, I&#8217;m not just talking about the Caribbean, but I&#8217;m also talking about post-colonial spaces like Ghana, and Nigeria, and India. And the really ferocious energy that a lot of those sign painting designs have come with, have been really inspiring to me for a lot of years. I&#8217;ve been obsessed with sign painting in Trinidad, and then beyond Trinidad for a lot of my life.</p>
<p>And I think that the project that I&#8217;m working on with Darden Studio right now is, trying to distill that hand painted sign energy into something that we could use for text, which has been a really interesting, challenging, not interesting challenge, but also really fulfilling. I&#8217;ve been really enjoying it, I&#8217;m working with Darden Studios designer [inaudible 00:07:59] on creating it, but it&#8217;s been really nice. It&#8217;s also frankly, nice to be building work for a studio that was founded by a Black typeface designer of whom there are so few.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true. I mean, I know that you were known as Trinidad&#8217;s first typeface designer.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, I&#8217;m not even sure that I&#8217;m&#8230; I think that there was a typeface that was designed before me in Trinidad. I think, that what I meant was that I am Trinidad first typeface designer, who is doing it for a living. But I think that even the idea of being the first, for me, is a lot less important, than it is the idea of being somebody who is making things that are culturally specific. I do think that there is a distance between who is making the work and who is the work for. And I think that who is the work for, is always a more interesting question, but who is making the work tends to be the question we ask. Which is something that I&#8217;m navigating, because I think that as a Black person who is making type in the world, I feel like that&#8217;s, yes, that&#8217;s a momentous occasion. Because up to 20 years ago, Black people were not making type.</p>
<p>But I also think that the reality is that, it&#8217;s far more about for whom the type that I&#8217;m making is than it is what I look like. Because to be frank, if there were a white man who were making typefaces that was inspired by post-colonial creativity, I would be as excited. But I do think that, that&#8217;s also because a lot of the work that I&#8217;m making right now, I am hoping that it does well commercially, but it&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s not for commercial consumption. But for example, with the typeface that we&#8217;re working on at Darden Studio, that typeface has a language support that is relatively rare among the type world. So it supports every single African tribal language in Latin, which is a rarity. But for me it was a little bit weird or inappropriate, to be developing a typeface that was inspired by these spaces, and not let that type face support the languages of the people by whom it was inspired.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I had Tr√© Seals on the show, goodness, that was years. I think there might have been 2017, 2018 before his typeface design, really started blowing up. And I see his typefaces everywhere, and it&#8217;s interesting that you say like, &#8220;Who it&#8217;s for.&#8221; Because granted, there&#8217;s a historical context in which Tr√© bases all of his designs, but I&#8217;ve seen them used in movie trailers, in yogurt commercials, I&#8217;ve seen them used everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Yeah, for sure. I think that Tr√©&#8217;s work is really important, and I mean, I&#8217;m saying this as a non-American, right? So I don&#8217;t have the same relationships that Americans may have even to oppression. But I do think that Tr√©&#8217;s work is, I feel like you can make work that is really on the pulse of the moment that you&#8217;re in, and his work feels really responsive to the moments that we&#8217;re living through. And I feel like there&#8217;s a particular beauty to that for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Totally. Let&#8217;s talk about Unqueue, which you started a little over two years ago. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Well, I had just come back home from, I think maybe New York, and I had in a way closed my design studio. So I had a design studio for about 10 years in Trinidad, and we were doing a lot of work in the web, we were doing a lot of work in the branding space. But it wasn&#8217;t that I didn&#8217;t love that work, but it was that I loved making type a lot more. And I was starting to phase that phasing, branding, and web work out of my career, and basically trending toward being a full-time typeface designer. But when COVID hit in New York, I had just left New York, and then I came to Trinidad. And when I was in Trinidad, because we used to have this studio that provided design services, we ended up in this place where a lot of my old clients would call and say, &#8220;Hey, Agyei, are you still working. We need a website, we need to sell stuff online. We can&#8217;t keep the business open, we can&#8217;t have people in the store or whatever.&#8221; And this was a massive influx for me.</p>
<p>And there was this decision that I had to make of, okay, well I can take on this business, and it&#8217;ll be probably good money or whatever, but it&#8217;s not necessarily scalable. And also there was this problem that was really clear to me. Because I grew up as a very, I would say, proudly working class person from a working class background. And the amount of money that it would&#8217;ve taken people to get online, in that time would&#8217;ve been prohibitive to the working class. And I wanted to be part of making something that can help people who didn&#8217;t have the, how much of a thousands of dollars it was going to cost to hire us.<br>
I wanted to give them the same ability to get online, do business, sell their stuff, as my other clients who would&#8217;ve been supporting my career however long, and I felt like the pandemic was a good opportunity. So I was working then with my studios lead developer, his name is Andal. And I called Andal, what do you think? And I was like, &#8220;Andal, do you want to make an app?&#8221; And he thought I was joking, and three months later we released Unqueue&#8217;s first version to the App Store. And since then it&#8217;s been something that has changed a lot, about how I see the value of the work that I&#8217;m making. But it&#8217;s also something that I&#8217;m really quite proud of it, because in a space with relatively low tech adoption, in which it&#8217;s a big circumstance in Trinidad, that we don&#8217;t have a huge amount of trust in technology.</p>
<p>So we do have one of the highest mobile penetrations probably globally, like relatively. So in the Americas, we have 110% mobile penetration, in Trinidad we have 142%. So we&#8217;re very online, very mobile society, but that transition of doing business digitally, didn&#8217;t really happen until we got forced into it by the pandemic. And something that I&#8217;ve been really happy about, is being able to be part of that transition and part of that change. So a lot of the work that I&#8217;m looking at with NQ is, not just about helping people sell things online, but there&#8217;s this movement of digital transformation that&#8217;s happening throughout the Caribbean. Yes, triggered by COVID, but also very necessary to help meet our sustainable development goals, necessary to reduce food import bills, et cetera. And as soon as I was able to realize, wow, we are building this thing, and not only is it&#8217;s a cool product to work on sure.</p>
<p>And I think that there aren&#8217;t product development studios in the Caribbean. So it&#8217;s not I think that a lot of the methodologies that we would&#8217;ve been importing, maybe even from Silicon Valley, we had to retrofit to work in our space, et cetera. So it was really exciting, but I think that for me, when Unqueue got kicked off, I started it as this thing that I thought would be able to help some people. And now I think that there&#8217;s this larger vision around, being able to guide the direction of the Caribbean. Because a lot of technology in the Caribbean isn&#8217;t made here, a lot of it is made for example, in Russia or in China. And angel investors bring software into the country, and try to retrofit it to the cultures. And we are the only people that are making the software that we&#8217;re using on the ground.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s a particular magic to that because we are able to be responsive, but we&#8217;re also able to develop solutions that are tailored to our experiences. We have 80% cash dependency in our country, where 80% of the transactions happen on cash, and that&#8217;s not going to change anytime soon, our banks aren&#8217;t going to facilitate that. So we, for example, had to build an e-commerce software that was also able to facilitate cash payments. But things like that I&#8217;ve been really, really exciting, and I think that Unqueue has probably been one of the most fulfilling professional experiences on my life. But it&#8217;s also been something that in a material way, we&#8217;re able to help 200 plus vendors, we&#8217;ve connected them with 20,000 plus shoppers. And I mean, it&#8217;s a small country, so that&#8217;s like those actually important numbers. But I think that for us, and I say us now, because Unqueue is way more than just me. But for us Unqueue has been this very transformative project that we&#8217;ve all worked on, and discovered a lot more value than we initially wanted. Well, initially we&#8217;re expecting to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, it sounds like it really came about at a very opportune time. I mean, you have this quote unquote perfect storm of a pandemic and things getting locked down, and people not being able to have that regular access to places that they usually had. And now you&#8217;ve got this app, that now facilitates a lot of that.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
100%. Yeah. That was really huge for us. So because that looked in people&#8217;s eyes of, I didn&#8217;t know we could do this. I feel it&#8217;s part of that mentality, has a lot to do with being from a traditionally disadvantaged post-colonial space like the Caribbean, and not really not seeing a potential for yourself that is better. And I think that, what our work has been able to do is to show people, &#8220;Hey, you deserve technology.&#8221; This idea of design and technology, have been classically relegated to large business in the Caribbean. And what I have been able or wanted to be able to do, is to create something that could be democratizing and something that could be accessible across the board.<br>
So I mean, Unqueue Studio, our tagline or motto or pedal driving principle is, design and technology for everybody. But that for everybody really is our big key thing, because the amount of change that we can make in one particular sliver or society, maybe a lot. But the reality is that if all I&#8217;m doing is helping rich people get richer, I probably would just go to work on Apple or something.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Fair enough. That makes sense. So let&#8217;s talk about Unqueue Studio, because that is something different from the app itself, right?</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
It was. Yeah. So I started on Unqueue two years or two years plus ago. And something that really stood out to us maybe about, I would say less than a year ago, was the fact that we had won a bunch of awards. So that&#8217;s one thing, so we&#8217;ve won awards every year for design and user experience since we&#8217;ve launched. So we&#8217;ve won a total of five Addy Awards, which are the American Advertising Association Awards, we&#8217;ve won five of those over the past two years. And the reason that we&#8217;ve won them is, largely because we&#8217;ve been making good design. But I think that&#8217;s something that we had to acknowledge is that, we are one of the few providers that are able to do this in the space that we&#8217;re in, but we&#8217;re also the only people that are building the products that we design as well.<br>
So I saw it as an opportunity for us to not just, yes, diversify how we build income at the company. But I also saw it as a real need, because this idea of design and tech being for everybody and this idea of design, I feel like it&#8217;s almost technology should be a fundamental, right? Just the ability to write or access to water. And I feel like companies like Unqueue Studio are there to help facilitate that, because there needs to be somebody between the general public and business interest. That can rip business interests, and their objectives into something that the public wants. And I think that I started the Unqueue Studio so that we could address that, but also so that we can make our contribution to the Caribbean technology sector and industry. Because we have so much in our tech world and industry, that is really good business man like a lot of pitch decks, hell of pitch decks.</p>
<p>But the reality is that, when it comes to materials substances products, getting made products, getting put into the world, we actually don&#8217;t have a huge legacy of doing that well. And I wanted to create a company that could change that narrative, among people in power in the Caribbean but also on the ground. And I do think that it has to do with a lot of post-colonial self hate. But I do think that there is this belief that we can&#8217;t do things properly on our own. So it has to get imported if it&#8217;s good, and I&#8217;m trying to make this case that actually it can be just as good as the imported stuff, if not better, if you make it here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Walk me through what a typical day is like. Because I mean, it sounds like a lot to balance between the app work and the studio.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
It&#8217;s a lot. Yeah. But I mean, unfortunately they have a synergistic relationship, or they can because it&#8217;s the same teams. So the app for us is our social impact project and, yes, we do work with larger businesses to help facilitate their e-commerce. But the large part of our business is this idea of small entrepreneurs, and say small in terms of following of money that they&#8217;re making, but small businesses moving through and helping their businesses grow. But the studio is doing that, but for other businesses essentially. So I think that in a day typically, I try to wake up and start work by 8:00, 9:00. And I would say, I spend about, let&#8217;s say 40% of my day Unqueue App, and then another 40% of my day on the Unqueue studio, and then another 20% of my day working on type stuff.</p>
<p>But the Unqueue App and the Unqueue Studio work are really synergistic, because a lot of the methodologies that we&#8217;ve developed at the studio, are the things that we use to run the app. But also a lot of the success that we&#8217;ve been able to have professionally, is because of how well the app has done. And also because we&#8217;ve spent so much time and money building this app, we also now have a lot of software infrastructure that other startups are using. So a lot of the work that we&#8217;re doing now is in diversifying the work that we&#8217;re doing. So a lot of my days are half entrepreneur, where I&#8217;m writing a pitch deck for somebody. And then I stopped doing that and I&#8217;m reviewing someone&#8217;s design. And then I stopped doing that and I&#8217;m reviewing someone&#8217;s performance for example. But I think that in a way I feel more comfortable doing as much as I can, than I would feel like I&#8217;m not doing enough, which is probably something to talk about with my therapist.</p>
<p>But for me, that is a really huge thing. I think, that I have spent a lot of time wanting my work to be meaningful and purpose driven, and the Unqueue Studio and the Unqueue App have given me that capacity to do it here. Because I do think that the work that I do in typography and in language support, especially since a lot of the work that I&#8217;m doing, is for people who have classically been ignored by the type world. A lot of that work is really important, but they are all along the same vein of, I want to use the abilities that I have to make an effective positive change in the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It sounds like that&#8217;s been a new discovery for you. Would that be accurate to say?</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
I think so. Yeah. I think that when I got into type, and maybe it was just I had finally become a real adult or something. But I do think that there was this realization that I had, because getting into type can be a really, really fun experience, maybe if you&#8217;re not Black. But I think 10 minutes and when you&#8217;re Black, you start realizing, hold up, firstly, nobody here looks like me. Secondly, every single language that I am being taught to value, and all of the little accents that I&#8217;m taught to pay super close attention to. And respect everybody&#8217;s language, only language respect that are being taught is about European languages, right? So they&#8217;ll tell me, &#8220;Hey, you need to make sure if you&#8217;re supporting Polish, you need to have Polish diacritics.&#8221; Or maybe you should just lean on the side of drawing a diacritics to support Polish, but it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, I get it. I get it. I get it. But who&#8217;s going to be supporting Twi or Fante, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>And the reality is that those languages aren&#8217;t thought of, and it&#8217;s not because of their population sizes, it&#8217;s just because the people who are making type are from Europe. And I think for as unfortunate as it is, it&#8217;s understandable to be able to see why you won&#8217;t want to look past these spaces that you&#8217;re in, when you&#8217;re meeting the work that you&#8217;re making. But I do think that if I&#8217;m not from these spaces that you&#8217;re in and I can see a gap, then I can either rail against the system and get mad at you for not doing something about it, which I have done to relatively negligible effect. Or I can choose to acknowledge that, &#8220;Hey, your limitations are around, how much you can see in the world, and your whiteness your privilege insulates you, from having to see a certain side of the world that may not be as comfortable to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the reality is that I don&#8217;t have a choice. People in Africa look like me, how could I be making type and not supporting their languages, it&#8217;s really basic stuff. And in the same way, I grew up really working class, people like me after the pandemic were mostly unable to make a living. Like this service industries were shutdown, hospitality industries are shutdown. There were a lot of people who looked like me that couldn&#8217;t do anything, but a lot of them probably had the little side hustle, that they could have advanced to a full-time hustle if they had the right infrastructure. So for me it was, well, let&#8217;s see if we can make the infrastructure, but it&#8217;s really about what can I do? And if I can do it, I should do it.<br>
And I&#8217;ll figure out how I&#8217;ll get paid for it, getting paid has been always a thing that I think about secondly, but fortunately I&#8217;ve always made that work. But I think that for me, I think maybe for the past few years, a lot of the work that I&#8217;ve been making has been around, not necessarily a settlement or writing of any wrong. But I do think that the work is about seeing where I can fill a gap, and placing my energy there instead of wherever else. Because I don&#8217;t not acknowledge, that I could probably go and make type for a large company somewhere. Or I also don&#8217;t acknowledge that I could spend most of my type design work building brands, for example.</p>
<p>But I do think that if we think about what people need in the type world right now, it&#8217;s probably greater accessibility. Africa is one of the most exploding economies in the world, in 10 years that&#8217;s actually going to be really necessary that you support continental African managers. And while that opportunity is there, I also would be doing the work, if that wasn&#8217;t the case. Because I feel like there is a certain amount of accessibility, that people will get written out of in the design can, just because of how white it is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You know, even as you say that they&#8217;re reminds me of some conversations I&#8217;ve had, over the years on revision path with other type designers. I think one of the first type designers I had on was episode 24, was this young guy named Kevin Karanja out of Nairobi, who had designed a typeface called Charvet. I don&#8217;t know if he kept it up, I remember when he designed it, I remember he got a good bit of international news for it. I don&#8217;t recall if he had kept it up, because he really was, I mean, when I was talking to him, he was 21. He was like, &#8220;I was just messing around and made this typeface.&#8221; And it wasn&#8217;t really, I guess, for a utility, he just did it to see if he could do it. But also I think he was leaning more into doing fine art, so I don&#8217;t know if Kevin is still even doing type design.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Yeah. I have not actually heard of him. You said, episode 24?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Have to check that out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. The other person and I haven&#8217;t had him on the show yet, I would love to. But he&#8217;s got me thinking about the work of [inaudible 00:26:22] out of Zimbabwe.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Yeah. He&#8217;s a huge influence. But yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. His book African alphabets, which took me forever to try to find.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s like [inaudible 00:26:35].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It is. Because it&#8217;s out of print and everything. But it&#8217;s such a great work in terms of just the anthropological, just meaning of showing what African alphabets are. And how different that is from what we would know as Roman alphabets or something.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Yeah. One of my first type design projects on the project, that I gave my pep talk on was Surinamese language, that he had actually documented in his book. And if he hadn&#8217;t documented that I wouldn&#8217;t have found it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So you talked a little bit about growing up. Tell me more about your origin story, you were born and raised in Trinidad?</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Yeah. I was born in Trinidad, I grew up with my dad alone. And I think I had a relatively traditional growing up experience, which is that my father wanted me to be something, I&#8217;m not an artist. And what that means, is that I think I was quite good at all of these things in school, but I was just really unfulfilled. So I was a good student but a bad teenager, if that makes any sense. And I think that by the time I was ready to graduate out of what Americans would call high school. By that time I was so determined to do my own thing, that I already decided this is going to be tough but I&#8217;ll do it. When I got out of school, I had walked away from engineering path that I was focusing on, and I decided to be a bartender.</p>
<p>And while I was a bartender, I was also making software. I had learned a few programming languages in school, and my first job was actually as a software developer. And while I was making software, I learned I like making these layouts for these interfaces a lot. And I started getting into interface design, and this would&#8217;ve been old school, this is pre-cloud, pre-material. And I realized, I quite liked that, and then I realized, &#8220;Oh wow.&#8221; I was looking on a website one day and it needed a logo, and I just told the client, &#8220;Look, let me just take a stab at that for few you birds.&#8221; And I did. And as soon as it was done, I was like, &#8220;Oh my fucking God, I love this shit.&#8221; And I decided to be a graphic designer essentially.</p>
<p>So I got out of software and became a graphic designer. And I think that I basically got into software, became a graphic designer and was freelancing for a couple years, and then decided to go to school at the University of Trinidad and Tobago, because I wanted to get better. And I did okay slash great in school, but I was living with parents, who just didn&#8217;t understand a lot around why anybody would want to do design, which he would call art. And in his head it&#8217;s like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want my child to be an artist, they stop.&#8221; So there was a relatively unsupportive environment at home then. And during that I decided, well, I want to be a designer and I don&#8217;t want to have to quit studying design. So I&#8217;m just going to move out and I moved out, and studying and living on my own was a difficult thing to navigate. So I just decided I would just start working, and I was always working while I was in school, just because I had a culture of getting classwork before.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm. And so, I mean, going to the University of Trinidad and you&#8217;re studying and working at the same time, did you end up finishing up or no?</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
I didn&#8217;t graduate out of UTT, I got into the program and dropped out almost at the end twice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Twice?</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Yeah. The first time was really just because I didn&#8217;t have a choice. And then the second time was because I went to school to finish my associates, and my lecturer at the time was like, &#8220;Hey Agyei, happy you want to be in school, love that for you. But you&#8217;re working toward where you already are.&#8221; Not necessarily in terms of my skill but in terms of professionally. And a lot of these schools in Trinidad are there to help you get a job, far less than they are to actually educate. And I think that it just felt like a right time for me to get out on my own. And I started working at an agency after, which I was fired from that agency a couple months after, but that was where I got my start, basically. That was when I decided I was really going to do this for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Because when I dropped out to school the second time I decided&#8230; Well, but I could do a bunch of things, I could probably go learn how to do math or something. But I think that for me, it was way more important than at the time, that I do something that was passion driven. And all of the things around my life had coalesced around me doing design for a living. And it was the first time that I did something and, yes, it paid my bills, but it was also the first time that I was able to do something. And look at the effects of it, and look at the effects that it had on other people and be like, &#8220;This is a good thing that I&#8217;m doing.&#8221;<br>
And I feel like that feeling has been in a way, what I&#8217;ve been chasing, but chasing is the wrong thing, because it implies more satisfaction than there is. But I do think that what I&#8217;ve been doing is working toward working, in pursuit of my understanding of the fact that design can actually positively affect people&#8217;s lives. And if you know that it can then let it, and the only way to let it is to do design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And I would say that your points, if you were already working, I mean, why stay in school? And I&#8217;m not saying this for people listening is like, you should drop out, but-</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Yeah. No, stay in school kids.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; based on the environment that you said you were in, if you were already working, what is the degree really helping you for at this point, you&#8217;re already making a living?</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
That was it like, I was paying my rent, but I was paying my rent and barely sleeping, because I have a career where I&#8217;m on the laptop and I&#8217;m building identities, and then I&#8217;m going to school. And I&#8217;m having to cut out pay stops.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
It was something where it is like dissonant. I feel like I&#8217;m getting prepared for the thing I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So what was your early career like, you mentioned this agency, was that Abovegroup that you were working at?</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
It wasn&#8217;t, it was not Abovegroup at first, Abovegroup was my dream agency. I applied to work at Abovegroup six times.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Yeah. They will admit for me being in the Caribbean and being a lover of design, and seeing the work that they put out for me was massively influential. Because Abovegroup it was founded by these two men, Alex Mills and Gareth Jenkins. Well, both had Trinidadian roots, but weren&#8217;t necessarily squarely based in Trinidad, but they were in Trinidad during the Abovegroup era. And something that really stood out to me was this, I mean, I don&#8217;t like this term, but it&#8217;s the best one that I have right now. But this internationalized approach to making design, which felt like it could stand up anywhere in the world. And for me, I was so inspired by that work that I told myself, I&#8217;m going to make work this for a company, or I&#8217;m going to make work this on my own, or I&#8217;m going to starve to death. But I&#8217;m not doing bullshit, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And I think that after school, a lot of the work was struggling, but struggling, not necessarily because of any reason other than not wanting to produce, what felt to me the role to mechanicalized output that people are. I think in Trinidad, we have a culture of advertising is all big thing, so that&#8217;s what designers make most of their money doing. But the advertising culture in Trinidad has really flattened expression, and I think that for me, looking at that work was always really demoralizing. So I was telling myself, I don&#8217;t want to work for these people, while also needed to make a living. So my employment history has been shaky at best, I think I maybe was employed for my longest stint, my longest job lasted eight months. Everything else was freelance in the middle of that.<br>
But I worked at a few agencies in Trinidad, and I think I would say that unhappy is a good way to describe how I felt. Just because I unhappy not necessarily because, I mean, the bosses were assholes, but bosses could be assholes everywhere. But it was more so I know that I&#8217;m not doing what I want to do, you know what I mean? I&#8217;m getting up, I&#8217;m making this artwork for these people, but I know that at the end of the day this isn&#8217;t how I want to&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to be known for this, I don&#8217;t wanted this to be what I&#8217;m carrying through in the future. So it was always in the back of my head, and then after many attempts I actually just got a job offer from it from Abovegroup. And Abovegroup was the first time that I was able to work as part of a team, and make the work that I wanted to make.</p>
<p>And I worked on Abovegroup for, I would say maybe a year or a little bit less than a year, but it was the most formative job experience that I&#8217;ve had, because here I was on a team of people attempting to make world class work, with world class, in my opinion, intentions and objectives. And eventually the company like design as a business internal that is hard to do, and it&#8217;s hard to make sustainable. And at some point in time, they had to realize that, &#8220;Hey, this isn&#8217;t going to work.&#8221; And they had to shutter their doors.</p>
<p>And when Abovegroup closed down for me, it was really demoralizing because I know I could have my own freelance career and stuff like that. But I think that what I learned from Abovegroup, is one how much you can do with people, as opposed to just yourself. But also I learned how much I enjoyed being part of a thing. And it&#8217;s only now that I&#8217;m able to look at the empty studio, and reflect on how much of the Unqueue Studio experience that I&#8217;m having, I took away from Abovegroup.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know exactly what you mean about working at a place, and feeling like you know that you&#8217;re&#8230; And maybe I&#8217;m saying this wrong, but you feel like the work that you can do is better than this, like I&#8217;m better than this place in terms of-</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Yeah. [inaudible 00:35:59].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; the work that you know that you can do, but you&#8217;re still stuck in this. I know what you mean, I know exactly what you mean.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Yeah. And I feel like it&#8217;s also&#8230; And I don&#8217;t say from a place of ego either, it&#8217;s almost from a place of desperate frustration. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Guys, why don&#8217;t we care about our clients?&#8221; Those kinds of things are those were always questions that remained so unanswered, that it was hard to feel comfortable in a space, where I shouldn&#8217;t feel more concerned about my clients than my boss did, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
And it felt like a lot of the timely work was this act of compromise, and lot of active compromise because we have to get it out, or because the clients is on a deadline. It&#8217;s always the compromise comes from, well, we don&#8217;t want to have another conversation with our client. And I was always in my head, well, okay, clients actually hire us to be the experts, they hiring us because they need somebody to tell them, when they&#8217;re fancy full ideas might not work.</p>
<p>And I think that the culture that we&#8217;ve had in Trinidad around business in general, and around the customer is always right quote, unquote, just didn&#8217;t allow for that kind of thinking. So when I wasn&#8217;t about group, it was the first time that I heard my boss say, &#8220;Yeah, I told our client, they could go fuck themselves, dude, they asked us to do some bullshit.&#8221; And for me that was huge because I didn&#8217;t even know we had that power in Trinidad. I knew we had that power elsewhere and it was nice to look at designers elsewhere, but at home it was wild for me to see that. So now even at the studio, we are probably one of the few studios that tells clients, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re not sure that your business model is really aligned, to what the kind of work that we&#8217;re trying to make.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s a more gentle way of saying that.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Yeah. I had to think that they may have not been able to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I know for me, I mean, I&#8217;m not going to lie, there was some ego in it. I was working at AT&#038;T, essentially a production designer, just working on an assembly line with a team of other designers, just cranking out these boring websites for small businesses. And I just knew that I was better than this, I was like, &#8220;I can do better than this.&#8221; And it pained me how the other designers who I worked with, a lot of them who happened to be Black designers were just okay with this very sort of&#8230; To me, it felt like this is boring pedestrian station in life. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You like this. You like these 15 minute lunch breaks, and then we have to go back to work for six hours, don&#8217;t you want better for yourself than this?&#8221; And for me, it was 100% ego. I get what you&#8217;re saying about kind of, especially with an agency, you would think that agencies would hopefully be more, I guess, appreciative of clients. And maybe, I mean, it sounds like this was your first agency type experience, and maybe that&#8217;s why it was so jarring.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;ve had a few agency experience, and I think that one of the realities in Trinidad, is that we have what you would call like franchised ad agencies. So a local business interest would get into a partnership with, let&#8217;s say Saatchi &#038; Saatchi, and they would bring a Saatchi &#038; Saatchi to Trinidad, but the only parts of the Saatchi &#038; Saatchi brand that they&#8217;re using on the name. So there&#8217;s nothing that&#8217;s going to be reflected in terms of the work ethos, or the creativity or anything like that. And that industry of design being production, and I think maybe just how they built the industry in Trinidad. I think it&#8217;s way more about getting the work done, so that we can get a new client in than it is about making work that gets us our next client.</p>
<p>So a lot of these agencies have 10 year, 15 year relationships with clients. And yes, they&#8217;re making underwhelming work every year, but they&#8217;re making underwhelming work at a understandable unexpected budget. So it&#8217;s not going to be a huge problem for the client. And I think that I was always really wary of ending up in that trap, because I felt like the reason that those companies were successful, is that same post-colonial shame of where from. So we&#8217;ll work with the Saatchi &#038; Saatchi because they can guarantee that it won&#8217;t be shipped, because it says Saatchi &#038; Saatchi in their name.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay. I see what you&#8217;re saying.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
But that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that the work is going to be good, it just means that there&#8217;s a implied client confidence. And I think that I knew that, I mean, in Trinidad we may have white people are a minority here, but they&#8217;re still the powerful group. So I was never under this illusion that I could start my own company, and just run it on the name of it, it would have to be about work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, it sounds like you&#8217;ve always done your own thing, whether it&#8217;s Unqueue, whether it&#8217;s your earlier entrepreneurial ventures that you touched on. For you, what have been some of the pros and cons of working like this?</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Yes, I have done my own thing for better always, but I think that as far as pros, I can really settle on the biggest pro of being. This idea of working on what you want to work on, is huge because if you can work on what you want to work on, and you can get paid doing it, and you can get paid enough to pay your bills. And buy some Prosecco on the weekend, in my world, that&#8217;s the literal best your life can be, right? So for me, my biggest pros is that I get to live a purpose driven life. And that doesn&#8217;t mean that my work is my life, but that does mean that if I am going to be spending eight to 10 hours a day doing something. That it doesn&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m just doing something to help someone else achieve some random goal around the money.</p>
<p>So in terms of, I think that I can make a way bigger impact way things by myself, because are the obvious cons, but not just security, huge fucking terrible, like now I&#8217;m fine until recently it was tricky. I think also in these spaces that I live in, there is a particular challenge with going on your own when you look like I do, even though most of the people from Trinidad Black or extended descent. I think that the challenge comes with believability. So I walk into my room, I have free-form dreadlocks, I don&#8217;t wear socks, I walk into the room and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hey guys, this is the design.&#8221; And while I&#8217;m saying that, I know I need to fight against all of the perceptions that are coming with me in the room. And in a way, the career that I was able to establish for myself in the states, was the thing that helped me to get past that here. Because when I tell people, &#8220;Oh, Google is one of my clients.&#8221; There&#8217;s a lot of shit that gets smoothed over, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>A lot of skepticism that leaves you room, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, okay, cool. We thought you were a fraud because of the hair, but you said Google so it&#8217;s fine.&#8221; And I think that for me, one of the biggest cons is that idea of, for me, and I mean, I&#8217;m seeing specifically, if you are a sole trader Black entrepreneur. Doing the things that I do in Trinidad, one of the cons is definitely going to be, walking around and through that pervasive doubt that your potential clients and payers will have of you. Just because they are in a way programmed to doubt you and to doubt your capacity to do things, I think that&#8217;s one of the hugest challenges.<br>
One of the huge challenges is just, having the best product in the room, but screaming, please somebody, listen to me. And in this invisibility, just because of where I&#8217;m from and what I look like, that again, I&#8217;m being really clear about, is way less now than it was back then. But I think that you&#8217;re a young Black boy in a Caribbean, and you want to start to design business. One of your biggest challenges is going to be credibility, and how do you get people convinced of your talent. Because it&#8217;s not going to be on how good your layouts are, it&#8217;s going to be about something else.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel that, I mean that respectability politics kind of thing is so pervasive. I mean, it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve had to deal with. Also I mean, I&#8217;m a big dark skinned Black dude with an Afro from the south, I walk in the most places, especially with some of the places that I&#8217;ve spoken at, some of the places I&#8217;ve done work for and everything. And I know how unassuming I come off and I play into that a little bit, like I went to Morehouse College.</p>
<p>And so Morehouse has its own reputation of suit and tie, and you&#8217;re this well red, well traveled person, blah, blah, blah, all this kind of stuff, that actively buck against. I&#8217;m not a suit and tie wearing person at all. And so I come up in most spaces and I tend to be pretty unassuming and I play into that a little bit, because I like people to be surprised like, &#8220;Oh, wow.&#8221; But I know what you mean about having to fight against that. Because oftentimes those perceptions will come from people who look just like you.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s mostly to be honest, most of the middle management is people who look like me, and middle management is who I need to get through. But I think that a lot of the people who look like me are really wanting to hire, and make connections, and relationships with a white man with an accent.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
And I am not like, I don&#8217;t provide them the opportunity for growth that they&#8217;re looking for, because you can&#8217;t grow unless you have connections with white businessmen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Whoo man. That&#8217;s&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
That&#8217;s heavy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, that&#8217;s real. I want to shift a little bit, and talk more a little bit about your type design work. We touched on a little bit earlier, but in 2017 you were part of the Type@Cooper Design program. Tell me how that experience was.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
It was well. Because I didn&#8217;t know I was going to get in, and I sent my application and then I got in, and then I had to take a loan, because I didn&#8217;t know I was going to pay for it and I got. And I remember really clearly, I&#8217;m saying all of this because I remember on my first day, I got into class and I got in there, and there were like three white kids, and I got into the class and none of them said anything to me. And then another white kid came into the class, and then a couple Asian kids came into the class. And at some point in time we were getting close to 9:00, and I had to acknowledge, okay, it&#8217;s not going to be another Black people here and that&#8217;s fine. That&#8217;s okay, don&#8217;t trip out, it&#8217;s fine, you&#8217;re in a place where Black people are minority, that&#8217;s, okay, right?<br>
And then my professor at the time whose name is Hannes Famira, one of my biggest influences as a designer. Came into the room and he looked at me, and I knew he looked at me with this look of, huh, all right. And I looked at him for the same look of, okay, this is what we&#8217;re going to do, huh. And for me, a lot of it was on one hand being in a classroom of people, who were from a space, and I&#8217;m saying a space, not necessarily America.</p>
<p>But they&#8217;re all from what I would say, larger more cosmopolitan spaces, that actually have some history around type design, or some understanding around type design, or some typographic history. And here I&#8217;m from the Caribbean where we don&#8217;t have any of that. And I&#8217;m staying, I think that for me, my type of group journey academically was a struggle, because I just wasn&#8217;t as quote unquote good as a lot of my peers, but I was a hard worker. So moving through the program for me was really fulfilling, because I mean, I would basically go to class, I would spend 12 hours a day at the Cooper Union, and then I would go to my shitty Brooklyn Airbnb and spend three hours of drawing again.</p>
<p>And I think that one of the things that I had to leave with was, I kept waiting for the experience that would help me validate my Blackness inside of all of that, and that never happened. And I had to acknowledge that the reason that it didn&#8217;t happen and wasn&#8217;t going to happen was, because I was getting ready to work in a space where there weren&#8217;t any other Black people. Because it was only when I was at the Cooper Union and I asked, &#8220;Wait, where the fucking, where the Black guys at, where&#8217;s somebody Black at.&#8221; And they had to be like, &#8220;Okay, sorry to break this to you, but we have one guy, Josh Darden, that&#8217;s it.&#8221; That&#8217;s the whole type industry Black people is Josh Darden. And I don&#8217;t know how much you know about Josh, but he&#8217;s a massive recruit. So while I was at Type@Cooper, I&#8217;m emailing Josh and Josh is like, obviously not fucking replied to my email. And I&#8217;m like&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m only laughing because I have tried to get Josh on the show for a while. And I think one of his white business partners stepped in, and just put the stop sign down, like &#8220;stop messaging us.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Yeah, that sounds about right. I mean to all of their credit, that&#8217;s Josh&#8217;s instruction and Josh&#8217;s desire. But, but Darden Studio is currently now run by a white woman. Her name is Joyce. I mean, great, she&#8217;s one of Josh&#8217;s best friends, but on&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the person who told me that.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Probably, yeah. She told me the same thing, [inaudible 00:48:37] we&#8217;re friends though I love her. So I can say that, I emailed and I was like, &#8220;Hey,&#8221; with so much milk in my fucking eyes like, &#8220;Hey, [inaudible 00:48:44].&#8221; I&#8217;m really hoping to get to this [inaudible 00:48:48], she&#8217;s like, &#8220;Listen, she&#8217;s not seeing anyone, good luck.&#8221; She&#8217;s like good luck with Type@Cooper, that&#8217;s it. But, no, we&#8217;re good friends now and, unfortunately publishing with them. But a lot of the experience for me was jarring, because I had to acknowledge where Black people were any type design spectrum. But I also had to acknowledge that gentle Eurasia of your experiences so that can happen, when you&#8217;re in white dominated spaces. It is an active thing, it isn&#8217;t like there&#8217;s normal malice, but there&#8217;s just a casual, not understanding, not relating to your circumstances that can feel really targeted after enough time.</p>
<p>That was how I would probably summarize my experience. I would summarize my experience as one that was really fulfilling in terms of how much I got to learn. But one that was also in a way, a little traumatizing in terms of how much I learned about the rest of it. So not the drawing part, not the Python part, not the understanding white space part, but just the cultural implication. And who&#8217;s making type, and who&#8217;s making type for whom, and where the type come from, type the whole. Like type design is the thing that facilitated commerce in the 15th, 16th, 17th century, that means slavery you know what I mean? So I think about that and I was like, okay, I&#8217;m also learning type in the Dutch fashion, from people who learned Dutch style type design. Which would&#8217;ve also been exploding in terms of its theoretical output, as a offshoot of the Dutch benefit from slavery.</p>
<p>Because I think that one of the greatest markers of a society&#8217;s progress, is if they started drawing type of art. You can tell a society&#8217;s appetite for conquest when they start printing their own letters, because you need to print their own letters to take over a space. And I feel like those things are the things that really&#8230; I think I could have learned a lot about drawing type on the internet, but I could never have learned about types place in the world and cultural context if I didn&#8217;t go to a school for it, because part of the curriculum was also learning about types history. So there was a lecturer called [inaudible 00:50:51], and he was exceptional in terms of his understanding of type and the evolution of type, obviously in a European context. But I learned so much about how&#8230; Because you go to enough history classes and you realize, okay, we&#8217;re not talking about Black people ever, that make you ask other questions around why we&#8217;re not talking about Black people.</p>
<p>So for me, Type@Cooper was culture shocking, but it was also really necessary because I learned a lot theoretically about making type, but I also was able to make amazing connections. I mean, Hannes who was my lecturers, one of my favorite people in the world, I was also able to from that lecture, or from that education experience, get in touch with people like my mentor DJR or my mentor Darden. Those were the entry points to get into a lot of where my life is right now with type. So I&#8217;m not mad at it, but it was really traumatizing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yikes. I hate to hear that. I mean, but it sounds like you were able to at least extract some good things from it.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, good traumatizing is weird, but what I do mean it was, is not traumatizing because anybody was out to get me or anything like that. I think it was traumatizing because everybody they&#8217;ve been building this curriculum and I don&#8217;t mean just type of group. I mean, white people have been building type design curriculum for a hundred years now. And this idea of, &#8220;Hey, Black people use language too.&#8221; Like that question didn&#8217;t come up. And I think that&#8217;s not the fault of your school, that&#8217;s the fault of the society that we&#8217;re in. And in a way, the education system can only ever be a strong reflection of the society that you&#8217;re in. And I think that you can learn a lot about the society and the culture, around type design might be part of its education system.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So knowing all of this, and I guess also the fact that you really pull a lot of inspiration from the Caribbean as a whole, how do you bring all of this to your work?</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Well, I mean, I think that a lot of the work now for me is, I think that I&#8217;ve given up on making beautiful typefaces, and I don&#8217;t mean aesthetically beautiful, I mean, the idea of aesthetically beautiful. I think that there are things that be dominant culture has taught us that type design needs to have, we need to have super tight joins. And a lot of the trendiness is left my palette in terms of what I want to make, I want to make work that is so deeply accessible and utilitarian and basic, because we&#8217;re not in a space where if we&#8217;re supporting Pan-African Latin languages, that we have expressionism.</p>
<p>The languages that support these&#8230; Sorry, the sponsor support these languages are what you would call the most white bread, boring, vanilla, Arial, Helvetica, type things. And that&#8217;s because most of the time you&#8217;ve needed supporters languages, is because you&#8217;re releasing it on a OS, or you&#8217;re releasing it on a&#8230; There&#8217;s these context where you almost have to support everybody, and that&#8217;s when it gets done. But it&#8217;s not getting done by the commercial types of the world or shop types of the world. And again, that&#8217;s not a hit out against either Christian, or Lucas who run commercial and shop type perspectively, but that is a reflection of the industry that we&#8217;re in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm. Let&#8217;s talk about Design Objectives. That&#8217;s something that you co-founded, I should say, with one of our past guests, Ayr√Ød Chandler, who we had on a couple of months back. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Well, Design Objectives started off as, it was this plan that we had while I was working at Abovegroup. So I was working at Abovegroup at the time, and myself, Ayr√Ød Chandler, and another designer, to whom I&#8217;m not related, but I&#8217;m good friends with named Melanie Archer. We started Design Objectives because there&#8217;s that same idea of not being a very nutrient culture, or not having a very nutrient culture around design was there. So we didn&#8217;t feel facilitated, we didn&#8217;t feel like designers were encouraged to do anything other than make ads. And I think that for all of us, it was the same deep desire to affect a positive change. So for us design objective was helping designers be better, but not necessarily from new perspective of giving them lessons about the stout or about color competition. Because you can make your way through that, but we wanted to give designers empowerment tools. So we wanted to show you how to make a contract, here&#8217;s how negotiation should work, this is how you should probably price your work.<br>
So a lot of the efforts that we were putting in were around, empowering designers to do their jobs better. Unfortunately, the pandemic pushed, because so much of Design Objectives was meeting oriented and socially rooted. We lost a lot of our traction during the pandemic, and I think since then we&#8217;ve released a slowed down the operation. For as much as we&#8217;re still doing things to connect design to people, I think that for each of us individually, we&#8217;ve moved past Design Objective as a nonprofit that we were founding, that we were running ourselves on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping that there&#8217;s a future evolution of that, that can probably be in the same space that we started it, in terms of supporting people and allowing them to really improve their practices. And again, not from the perspective of the aesthetics of the work that they&#8217;re making, because Caribbean people are very creative and very talented. But I think that there has been a culture of designers not being respected, and then thus not respecting themselves that we start to Design Objectives to try to fix for. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve met up in a couple of years now, even though Melanie is also one of Unqueue&#8217;s showrunners by the way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean you should probably interview her off the record. But she&#8217;s one of the more influential designers, not just in our space, but in terms of the contemporary art world in the Caribbean as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I mean, it&#8217;s pretty clear to me that you like to stay busy. You&#8217;re doing a lot between the studio, the app, and other things like, what are you doing for you? What are you doing for self-care with all of this?</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Unfortunately, I used to party really hard when I was younger. So I would say maybe between 17 and 25, I was just piles of drugs, just a lots of booze, I&#8217;m saying that all of those things are now boring to me. And what I do now for fun is I have an orchid collection, so I take care of about a hundred plus orchids at my apartment. Wow, I can&#8217;t believe I said that out loud. I do a lot of baking and cooking, I&#8217;m such a Saturday stay at home guy, I am Mr. Yogurt on a Saturday morning. And that&#8217;s what [inaudible 00:57:13], I try my best to just enjoy the life that I built for myself, because I think that there is so much in the work that I&#8217;m doing now, that can be in a way I&#8217;m busier than I&#8217;ve ever been. And if I don&#8217;t make sure to separate myself, my whole life can be about the work that I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p>And I think that there was a period in time when I was really comfortable with that, with making my life about what I&#8217;m doing. But I think that now I want to make my life about how much I&#8217;m enjoying my life, and I do enjoy my life in making the work that I&#8217;m doing. So there&#8217;s that, but that&#8217;s just part of my enjoyment. So I take care of my plants, I have a beautiful dog, his name is Baxter and I spend as much time with him as I can. And I&#8217;m trying new fried chicken recipes, I&#8217;m trying new bread recipes. I wish I would say that ice skating or going surfing and stuff, but I&#8217;m not, I am a bridge to the water, I live in the Caribbean, but I&#8217;ll go look at the beach.</p>
<p>But I just feel like, a lot of what I&#8217;m doing for myself right now, is stepping away from work being my everything. Because it was my everything for a serious period of time, and I think that a lot of my substance abuse was driven by mitigating against that. So work is taken over my life, I&#8217;m just do some drugs so I can make it through, and now work is taken over my life, I need this weekend.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project or something that you would love to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
I think that if I think about dream projects, I think about&#8230; A lot of my current drive is around the Caribbean and facilitating entrepreneurship, and development in the Caribbean using the software that we made, but also the methodologies that we developed. So if I think of dream project, we are currently right now working with the government at Trinidad and Tobago, to help with the same farming project. We&#8217;re trying to scale it across the nation, but we&#8217;re also working with them on building software tools for financial inclusion. In my opinion, being able to help people on the ground in that way from the space that I&#8217;m in. It couldn&#8217;t get more dreamy than that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are some of the mentors that have really helped you out throughout your career?</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Definitely Gareth Jenkins and Alex Mills from Abovegroup, huge influences. I think that they were the first people to teach me that, you could stand up for design and people won&#8217;t hate you as much as you think. DJR, David Jonathan Ross, who is a American typeface designer has been one of my rocks, and one of the most encouraging designers that I&#8217;ve ever met. He was the first person that I sent my work, who didn&#8217;t just tell me something patronizing. So I would share work with people and they&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Oh, this is amazing.&#8221; But he was the first person to be like, &#8220;Hey, got your font, here&#8217;s a PDF for all of the mistakes.&#8221; It sent it back to me, which I think it was one of the best things from my career as a designer, because I think that there is a lot of white guilt that can get in the way of productivity, when it comes to giving people feedback on my work.</p>
<p>Especially, you see a young Black guy making type and its like, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want to break a spur.&#8221; But actually I was far more concerned in positive feedback than I was in validation, and he was really good. I think he saw that and he was really good at that. And I think I feel the same way, what Eben Sorkin, who is a designer, who works for Darden Studio, and has also made the Merriweather font, which is pretty popular on the internet. But I think that those two typeface designers have been really influential to me. There&#8217;s also Hannes Famira and Just van Rossum, who are German and Dutch type designers, respectively, and used to work in programming really changed my outlook on whether or not programming had a place in my design practice.</p>
<p>And Hannes outlook on typeface design, really helped me and still helps me now when I&#8217;m making work, remind myself that it&#8217;s as good as you want it to be and you can make it better, but the reality is that some of the decisions that you make will have to be personal ones. And I think that in a world that has so much rigidity like typeface design, those two people who are&#8230; I would say typeface designers with a very strong [traditional 01:01:15] sense of output, the ethos that they&#8217;ve been making that work with has been in a way radical, and I am really inspired by that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What do you want the next chapter of your legacy to be?</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Oof, legacy, yikes. I think that in five years I hope that Unqueue&#8217;s infrastructure is more pervasive in Caribbean, and we&#8217;re helping facilitate even more lives being built and transformed. I&#8217;m hoping that for my type design practice, that I&#8217;m able to find even more time to draw and even more time to produce. And I&#8217;m hoping that by in five years my first font with Darden Studio would&#8217;ve done relatively well, because it would&#8217;ve been out for a few years. But I think that what I want for myself, I mean this is not just in five years but also in five years, I would like the work that I&#8217;m making to see its potential through in terms of the impact that it can make in other people&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, and your work, and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
My best place to find me online is on Twitter. But I also have a website at agyei.design. The Unqueue Studio has a website, it&#8217;s unqueue.studio check that out for sure, especially if you&#8217;re interested in tech in the Caribbean. And we have the Unqueue marketplace, which is unqueue.app, which is what we use to help small businesses right now. If you can get on any of those platforms and you can&#8217;t find me, then I just didn&#8217;t want to be found.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Agyei Archer, I want to thank you just so much for coming on the show. Like I said, this is been a long time coming, I really wanted to have you on the show for a while and you didn&#8217;t disappoint. I mean, I think first of all, just hearing about your work ethic and how you&#8217;ve built Unqueue I think is super inspiring, particularly in this weird flux state we&#8217;ve all been in since the beginning of 2020. But I think also just the fact that you are someone who looked and found a void in the market or a void in the world, and you&#8217;ve actively worked to use your skills and your talents to fix that. I think that&#8217;s something that all of us can walk away from learning just about you, but also just about the best ways that we can use the skills that we have to create a more equitable world. So thank you so much for coming on the show, I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Agyei Archer:</b><br>
Thank you, Maurice. I&#8217;m really grateful as well for your patience, and waiting as long as you have to get me on. But also I feel like the work that you&#8217;re doing is really valuable, and I hope you get to keep it up.</p>
