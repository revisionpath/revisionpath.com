Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>We&#8217;re halfway through the year! Summer&#8217;s here, and I thought it would be a great time to feature an extraordinary young designer whose work I recently discovered &#8212; Keisha Okafor. Her work is brimming with energy and vibrancy and joy &#8212; feelings we all could use a bit more of these days.</p>
<p>We start off talking about freelance design, and Keisha told a bit about how she helped <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rERRIna8dA" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">make one of the features Google Doodles for Black History Month 2021</a>. Keisha also spoke on her signature design style, talked about one of her dream projects, and gave some great advice on being an illustrator. Keep an eye out for Keisha &#8212; I think we&#8217;ll definitely see more of her work in the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
My name is Keisha Okafor. I&#8217;m a freelance illustrator. And I would say that my work I&#8217;ve been using depicts joy and celebrates people. I really like to use bright colors and bold patterns.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s the year been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been going pretty great. I actually just went freelance full time. So that&#8217;s the thing. But before that, I&#8217;ve been working full time in design as a production designer, actually for print and also doing project management. Ironically, I was managing all the print projects I was doing. So kind of like a one-woman show. So all of that was very technical and like sending client emails. And then out of work, I was doing illustrations and drawing and working with my freelance clients. So it&#8217;s nice to have more time this time, but honestly, it&#8217;s been going pretty well. I mean, I know the whole pandemic is still happening. In my mind, it&#8217;s not even close to being over, but as a very, very heavy introvert, my day-to-day isn&#8217;t really that different, I be inside. So I&#8217;m still watching Anime, still playing video games. Yeah. Outside of work is pretty normal to me because I wouldn&#8217;t be outside anyway.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Wow. So yeah, you just went freelance. That&#8217;s a kind of scary thing to do to make that leap of faith. I mean, did you feel like you were prepared for it when you did it?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. I definitely did, which is surprising because years ago, would have been terrified, but I did a lot of planning, I watched so many seminars and workshops about going freelance, like what do you need to have in place before you do that? And I also saw enough clients coming in and projects coming in to where I believed like this is going to keep happening. I&#8217;m not just a Juneteenth, Martin Luther King Day illustrator. I can do this 365. So once I saw that and all the other planning I&#8217;ve been doing for the past several months, I wasn&#8217;t as scared as I expected to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s good. That&#8217;s good. I mean, oftentimes, we&#8217;ll have the designers that are here on the show that either are freelancing or they&#8217;re thinking about going freelance, and making that leap can often be really scary. I mean, you said that you had some preparations in place, which is good. I mean, to know that you can step out there and have at least some sort of a foundation, so you&#8217;re not necessarily going at it alone, but you have, it sounds like you had some major things already planned out before you made the jump, like clients.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. I also had savings. That was like my main thing. I didn&#8217;t want to jump with like $25 in my account. So with all the freelance money I&#8217;ve been getting, luckily because I had the full-time job, I was able to save all of that pretty much by pretending that I didn&#8217;t have it. I was tricking my mind, like, don&#8217;t spend this, this is for your future. Like, don&#8217;t wild out and buy stuff, but I&#8217;m also not naturally a big spender. My biggest splurge last year was getting Netflix, the two accounts. Yeah. I mean, I bought video games, but I would&#8217;ve done that anyway, but yeah, I got Netflix. So that&#8217;s like an idea of something I think about, a purchase that I would think about for a while before doing so. Was able to save all that money to have bought a year&#8217;s worth just in case nothing happened, which I don&#8217;t believe that was going to happen, but just in case, I had enough money to live off of that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a very smart move.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Thanks. I take risks, but it&#8217;s very calculated because I get very scared, just the idea of going freelance is so scary. So I just wanted to make sure I have things set in place, I thought it through that I&#8217;ll be good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What made you decide to go freelance? You said you were working as part-time gig, did something happen or did you just feel like it was just time to go?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Honestly, just in general, the jobs I&#8217;ve had, it was a full-time job too. Boy, was I tired anyway. It was just like, no matter what job I had, it ended up being rinky-dink. And by rinky-dink, I mean, no matter how confident I am, no matter how competent I am at the job, no matter how much work I do, how fast I go, I&#8217;m still getting treated like I&#8217;m entry-level or like the level of a recent graduate in my pay, in how I&#8217;m talked to when I ask questions. And I&#8217;m just getting tired of that. And because I saw that doing freelance wasn&#8217;t as intimidating as I thought, I was just like, let me better myself and make sure that I&#8217;m handling that side for myself, that I get to advocate for myself and also determine what I&#8217;m worth.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is a big reason why I ended up going freelance back in 2008, the company that I was working for was treating me in that same way, like I felt like I was being undermined or belittled or patronized too, even though I&#8217;ve got the skills to be there and I&#8217;m cranking out top quality work, you still feel like you&#8217;re almost treated like a child.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yes. Oh my gosh. Yeah. This past job, the work I was doing, it took four people to do before I got there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. And they&#8217;re not a startup company. They&#8217;ve been around for many years over a decade. And even taking on that work, they still saw me as a rookie. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Really after all of this?&#8221; So I could see that that wasn&#8217;t really going to change anytime soon. They would give me compliments, but I&#8217;m like, &#8220;But my pay isn&#8217;t changing.&#8221; And when I say things and give suggestions, it&#8217;s just going over the head and out the window. So I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;All right, I see where this is going. I&#8217;m out.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What does a typical day look like for you right now? I know you just started freelancing, but have you started getting into a good rhythm?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. Generally, I have a Trello account, where I have all my freelance projects that I&#8217;m working on right now and just different to-do lists, broken down to all the small steps, just so I can see overall what I need to work on. So if there are any priorities or upcoming deadlines, I&#8217;ll then write a list, a to-do list of like at least three things I want to get done during the day, like I want to finish this sketch or I want to finish this piece, send this email to the client, things like that. I usually start my day at around 10 o&#8217;clock. I am not a morning person at all. Also, I have a cat who only wants to be pet in the middle of the night. So from like 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM, she&#8217;s crawling on my chest, like, &#8220;Pet me, pet me.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Let me sleep.&#8221; That&#8217;s why I start at 10:00 to get back some of that sleep I lost.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
But yeah, I usually start eating cereal, see if I have any emails. I don&#8217;t really get too many emails, but I&#8217;m also someone who like, I get through them. So I usually only have like three tops. And then I just start the work I&#8217;m doing. And if, and then I just keep reviewing that Trello list with my deadlines and checking things off. And if I&#8217;m like at the right pace, because I&#8217;m trying to pace myself doing a little each day to make sure I hit the deadlines early, instead of like binge doing it all in one day. So once I hit that pace for the day, if I&#8217;m done, then I&#8217;ll take a break and rest for the day. Yeah. That&#8217;s generally how it&#8217;s been going so far.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. The best thing about freelancing is really setting your own schedule and then no one can tell you to change it. It&#8217;s completely up to you. So if you want to stay in till 10:00 AM, till noon, you can do that. No problem.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. It still feels like, I feel like a kid beginning summer break, but then I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Keisha, you&#8217;re an adult.&#8221; Make sure you get stuff done, which I always do. But waking up at 10 o&#8217;clock and being like, &#8220;Well, time to get this started.&#8221; That still feels wild to me. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I get to do this. I planned for this and it&#8217;s happening.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Now, I first heard about you this year from your work you did for YouTube&#8217;s Black History Month campaign. I think they did four different illustrators and artists for each of the four weeks in February. Can you talk about that? How did you become a part of that project?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah, that still blows my mind. This was like maybe a week before Christmas. I randomly get this email saying, &#8220;Hey, Keisha, I work with YouTube. Want to work on this project about Black Creativity for Black History Month?&#8221; I immediately thought it was a scam. And then I googled everyone that he mentioned just to make sure kind of just like, who are you? What the heck? His email didn&#8217;t say @youtube.com. So I was just like, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know about this. Let me just double check.&#8221; But I googled everyone and then their LinkedIn pages were like, they&#8217;re designer at Google, engineer at Google. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, okay. So he was serious.&#8221; So I immediately said, &#8220;Yeah, I am available to do this. Are you kidding me?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. And then probably a week or so later, I met with like a small design team at the YouTube. And they were just telling me about the initiative that they had and they want to work for artists celebrating History Month and wanted to have all the artists make art around black creativity. And that was it. They were like, &#8220;You can make that whatever you want it to be, but it just needs to be around black creativity.&#8221; And they gave some keywords, like forward-thinking, hopeful, bright, like that. Literally, those were the keywords they gave. So I pretty much just took that and ran with it. But also in the back of my mind, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay. Okay, Keisha, this is YouTube. You got to show up, you got to show out. So like, do it, do the thing.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
So initially, I was planning on doing portraits of women who in math and science from the past just to celebrate them. But then they wanted something, when they said forward-thinking, that&#8217;s why they gave me the idea of having children in there, like giving like a hopeful idea instead of looking to the past, wanting people to look to the future as well. And I was the one who chose math and science, just because normally when you think of creativity, I usually think of a paintbrush, like dancing and music.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
And they also mentioned that they didn&#8217;t want to hit the normal black stereotypes. So like a boombox and people doing break dance. They want it to steer away from that. So I personally like math. I still, even at my big age, I watch PBS Kids shows about math and science. So I figured that would be a fun thing to do, a fun thing to go around. And that&#8217;s in that forward thinking idea, it was me having like women in STEM, showing young girls the magic in front of it. So that&#8217;s where the idea came based on their feedback. That&#8217;s how that idea came to pass.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. And once they approved it, I was just going with it. The main critique was at first, I made everyone dark skin and almost the same tone. And they were like, &#8220;Oh, can you give it some variety?&#8221; I go, &#8220;Oh yeah, no problem.&#8221; And then they wanted me to use like, I was being very literal at first. So like the sky is blue, rockets are gray. And they were like, &#8220;Can you use like some of the colors that you use? Like the ones that you use.&#8221; And I was just like, &#8220;Oh, okay. So you actually want me to put my spin on it.&#8221; I was putting all these rules, adding all these rules to myself. This has to be very literal. If I&#8217;m drawing math, it needs to look like math. But once they said that, then that&#8217;s when I went crazy with the colors, like, &#8220;This guy could be pink and yellow and purple.&#8221; So yeah. Then I added my own spin to that. And that&#8217;s pretty much how it turned out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I have to say it looks amazing. And for people that haven&#8217;t seen it, we&#8217;ll make sure to put a link to it in the show notes so you can definitely check it out. I mean, I get that kind of forward feeling, that forward-thinking notion from that. It&#8217;s interesting enough, I had discovered an organization, I think they either left a comment or I saw it somewhere else on the web, but because your piece was centered around STEM, I had discovered this group called Black Girl MATHgic, like Black Girl Magic, but MATHgic. And I mean, I love math too. My degree is in mathematics. So I saw that, I was like, &#8220;That is so cute.&#8221; That was the cutest thing I&#8217;ve ever seen. It&#8217;s like it&#8217;s a program, but then they also sell some merch for fundraising and stuff. I was like, &#8220;This is really dope teaching young black girls math fundamentals and stuff.&#8221; It&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Oh, that is so amazing. I just love that so much. And the lack Girl MATHgic, Oh my gosh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It sounds like you working with YouTube on this was like a really kind of collaborative process. Are those sort of the best types of clients for you to work with?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yes. I would say that working with YouTube was definitely like ideal client. They were very responsive, followed the schedule, they communicated so well. And they were also really nice, like we&#8217;re working with big clients, I just assumed like they were going to be very strict and we need to have it look a certain way. They want to work with people, but they want it to look a certain way, it&#8217;s what I expected. But working with them, I really saw that they wanted me to show myself in there and to put my own spin. When they said, put your own spin on a theme of black creativity, they actually meant it. That&#8217;s why I mentioned the thing with the colors. That was like very refreshing for me, something I really enjoy, like the great communication, being responsive, when things were delayed, they adjusted the schedule to match the delay. I was like, &#8220;You&#8217;re amazing.&#8221; Yeah. I really enjoyed them as a client. And those are things that seeing that it&#8217;s possible, those are things that I start to look for when I&#8217;m working with people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s go back to freelancing just a little bit more. When you have a new client or you&#8217;re approaching, let&#8217;s say, a new project, what does your creative process look like?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. So usually, I try to get as much information from the client at the beginning as possible because a lot of people say, &#8220;Oh, just do whatever.&#8221; But they actually have something in mind. So I try to ask a lot of initial questions, just to get an idea, like, do you have an idea or do you actually want me to give you my ideas? I just want that to be clear from the very beginning before I start doing research. And then I also asked like a lot of technical questions, how much do you want the resolution to be? What size? What&#8217;s your timeline? Because if it&#8217;s a small timeline, then I won&#8217;t try to do this super complex thing. I&#8217;ll make it simpler.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
But in terms of like the creative making the thing once that&#8217;s settled, I usually do a lot of research on stock websites. I like iStockphoto, just to get an idea of like composition, and if it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m not familiar with, I can&#8217;t just think of 35 math formulas off the top of my head. I just got f of x imprinted in my mind, but I need more. So I like to look at stock websites just to see what kinds of things are default, their body poses, body expressions, what do real people look like? Because I don&#8217;t want every person I draw to have the same face, but different bodies and different hairstyles. That feels weird to me, but I like when other people do it.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. So I like to go on stock websites just to see if anything is giving me ideas, is it inspirational? Is it good for reference? And once I get that, I&#8217;ll start sketching out different ideas, trying out different compositions, just to see like, does anything look good? Can I draw this thing? What are the hands going to look like? And then usually, that&#8217;s when I start going back and forth with the client, seeing what they think of my ideas.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
But if anything&#8217;s going in the right way, usually, that&#8217;s also the time I&#8217;ll ask, &#8220;Do you have any other ideas once you see this, a better idea of what you&#8217;re looking for kind of thing?&#8221; And then once that happens, I&#8217;ll either revise it or start going with color, again, make more ideas, send that to them. And then it&#8217;s usually just a back and forth, giving them the art and then getting their feedback. But as I&#8217;ve been working and seeing like how easily that can turn into a 100 revisions, I put limits like, okay, we&#8217;re going to have two rounds of revisions. And if you want more, this is going to cost. So yeah, I say back and forth, but it&#8217;s back and forth like twice just to protect my time essentially.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, even with all of this, are you also thinking a lot about, let&#8217;s say, colors, like a color story or anything to go along with a new project? Or does that come naturally?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Sometimes it comes naturally, but I also have a Pinterest board just full of different pictures that are like, it&#8217;s either a fashion outfits, stationary, graphic design branding, things like that. But if I don&#8217;t have any ideas, I&#8217;ll just pick from that, like, oh, let me try this, or since I&#8217;m on social media a lot and have a lot of artists I follow, there are just some artists I like the way they use color. There&#8217;s an artist, her name is Olivia Fields. And one thing she likes to do is have a very monochromatic color scheme, but she uses value so well it&#8217;s still very interesting to look at. So if I&#8217;m thinking about that lately, I&#8217;ll like, let me try to use a monochromatic scheme just to see what it look like if I do it kind of thing. If it doesn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;ll just trash it. But yeah, it can either come from other artists, that Pinterest board or I&#8217;ll just start off with, I want the main color to be yellow and then I&#8217;ll just randomly pick colors and adjust it based on that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. So I want to switch gears here a little bit based on what we were talking about prior to recording. You mentioned you&#8217;re from North Carolina, that&#8217;s where you grew up. Tell me what it was like growing up as a creative kid in North Carolina.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. I will say my grew up story isn&#8217;t similar to like the ones I hear on interviews. People will be like, &#8220;I drew all the time, I love drawing.&#8221; I drew some of the time and I was mostly watching cartoons, animated movies, just a lot of TV, playing a lot of video games. It wasn&#8217;t until I was 13 that I even decided like, oh, I want to do something art related. It was from seeing the Incredibles. I saw the behind the scenes animation thing. And I was like, &#8220;I want to be an animator.&#8221; But then once I got closer to picking a college and saw what animation was, very quickly, it was like, no, I don&#8217;t want to do that.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
I want to draw because I used to draw like a little bit, when I say every once in a while, I mean like a handful of drawings per year. I wasn&#8217;t really, I liked to draw, but I wasn&#8217;t sitting around drawing all the time because I was just overthinking it so much, I would draw, one time, I drew the Powerpuff Girls, like just very stiff Powerpuff Girls poses and look like them. But then I took it to school for the next few days and showed everyone. I was like, &#8220;Praise me. I&#8217;m a good artist. Look at me.&#8221; And then didn&#8217;t draw for like the next few months.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
That was me as a kid artist, but still very much enjoyed it. I took art classes in middle school and high school. And I would say that&#8217;s where my artistic skills and sense and interests started to grow. I wasn&#8217;t doing anything like extracurricular. I was just taking it as an elective. So by the time I got to college, I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any other interests. I want to be an artist. And I&#8217;m hoping college will unlock the key to figure out how people actually get paid to make art.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I mean, you went to North Carolina State University, which we&#8217;ve had several alums just here on the show that have went there. While you were there, do you feel like they really prepared you to become a working designer out in the world?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Now, when I look back at it now, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh yeah, they actually did.&#8221; But at the time, I didn&#8217;t think so at all, because it just felt very vague, because I also, I majored in art and design at NC State and I thought that meant I&#8217;m going to paint, like be an artist. They attach design to it. But they really mean art, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
It was like the first week they were like, &#8220;Hey, I know you guys like to draw and paint, but we&#8217;re not teaching you to be artists, we&#8217;re teaching you to be designers.&#8221; And in my mind, I was just like, &#8220;No, what is design? Oh, no.&#8221; Looking back on it now, I see they were teaching us how to think like designers and how to problem solve. And that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been so helpful. And also, with drawing, making sure you understand the foundations of drawing, that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been using a lot as well, but really that problem solving thing and also how to think like a designer, I would say that&#8217;s been the most helpful in my design career. But in terms of like how to get a job, how to make a good portfolio for a job, nope. I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;I wish I did something about it.&#8221; But now that I am working and have had jobs, those design fundamentals have actually been very helpful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Now, after college, you ended up for a while moving out to LA, what prompted that?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
It was actually like one of those moments of close family member passed away. So it was just very much like life is short kind of moment, let me try things that I would never do, just you never know you get this chance again. And growing up, watching a lot of TV, California always looked cool. And that was one of my bucket list thing, like I want to see what it&#8217;s like to live in California. So once that chance came up, I just went for it, oh, man. So scared. I was sweating on that plane just, Ooh, oh my gosh. I was so scared. But yeah, that&#8217;s how I ended up getting there.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
And really, my goal was just to see, like, can I go there and survive? Can I do enough to make sure I don&#8217;t have a flight back in three months? And I ended up staying for four and a half years, going on five years. I came back to North Carolina at the end of 2019, months before, I mean, months before COVID happened. So I am so, oh, I don&#8217;t have family in California. So that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m like, I am so glad I moved just in time so I could be near my family and at least know they&#8217;re safe in person versus a phone call from like 3000 miles away.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, while you were out there, did you get a chance to really experience the LA design scene?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t think so. When people say that, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;So where&#8217;s the scene at? And how do I get there?&#8221; My only experience was through the jobs I had. And comparing it to North Carolina, the main difference I noticed was that things were way more fast-paced. Yeah, that was like the biggest difference I noticed. And also like, but this is with anything. Once you see the process behind things, it takes that bale away. Things aren&#8217;t as glamorous as I initially thought, like I had a job at a media buying agency, where I was editing album covers for social media posts or resizing banner ads that will be put on YouTube, like watching the YouTube video and seeing of like, oh, this looks so like, well, one it&#8217;s annoying, but also seeing like a big artist with an ad, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ooh, fancy.&#8221; But hearing the media buyers trying to get the space and make it and asking me to resize things and how crazy that process can be, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Okay. These are just regular people trying to just do their jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
And I would say a big thing that just in general in the workforce, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Man, people procrastinate so much.&#8221; I thought that was like one of those warnings I got in college, like, you&#8217;ll never be able to procrastinate when [inaudible 00:27:40], but adults do that all the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All the time.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yes. Oh my gosh. And it happens so much. When I was working on those album covers, I was just like, &#8220;Come on guys. Just please send me the picture so I can resize it.&#8221; But it did help me build up efficiency because there were such fast turnarounds. I was used to working at a fast pace. So coming back to North Carolina, that&#8217;s how I ended up, when I mentioned earlier doing the work of four people, because I was used to working so fast. Like when things are slower here, it wasn&#8217;t that big of a deal. It felt normal. It helped me in that sense. But yeah, you asked about the design scene. I would also love to know what the scene was like, where was the all people? Where were the people at? What do design people do? I didn&#8217;t really get that question answered.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, it&#8217;s interesting because like, you mentioned earlier like, well, where is the design scene? I think designers carve out their own scene based on who they&#8217;re working with or working for, who they have met or inspired by. I&#8217;ve been to LA only once, I went in the beginning of 2020 in February. And I found that it was just like real, it was just so spread out. I mean, Atlanta is spread out, but LA is way more spread out. I&#8217;m like, it takes forever to get anywhere. Like if you&#8217;re going to go somewhere, you better hope it&#8217;s on your side of town, you don&#8217;t have to cross over and go down. It&#8217;s so big. I was there for two weeks and I know I only saw maybe like a 10th of LA. It&#8217;s so big. So big. I mean, I guess when I asked about like how the design scene was, I&#8217;m curious if it was different from maybe the design scene that you knew back home in North Carolina, like you mentioned, it was more fast-paced, but were there other differences?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good question. I will say, like you mentioned, because everything was so separated, it was kind of like, if you weren&#8217;t in that neighborhood, we&#8217;re not going to meet or we&#8217;re not going to meet often. So it ends up being like pockets of communities that I would notice. So I had a lot of animation friends because they lived in Glendale and Burbank and they were interested in working at Cartoon Network or Disney TV.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
So I would meet those people in Burbank and Glendale, but then the people who were interested in more of graphic design or stationary, I talked to those people down near the beach because that&#8217;s where a lot of the agencies were. It was like, I could find pockets of people in different areas, but it was so rare for them all to come together just because how long it took to go places like, like literally, Google Maps will say something is maybe 10 miles away and you think, oh, I&#8217;ll get there no time. That&#8217;s an hour trip one way. I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t add up.&#8221; But then you take the trip and I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;That took an hour. Oh my gosh.&#8221; So it&#8217;s just like people aren&#8217;t going to make that. Even people who were natives, they weren&#8217;t really going to make that trip on a regular basis. So it was just like pockets of communities that I would have in the different places I was at depending on where I lived and worked. That&#8217;s how I ended up seeing the people.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
But I feel like in North Carolina, everyone is in Raleigh, you&#8217;re in Raleigh, I can get to the edge of Raleigh, the top, it will take like 20 minutes. So to me, compared to being in LA, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not a big trip at all.&#8221; So I feel like people are taking more initiative to meet up, and I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s because of COVID as well, have like a lot of meetups and groups and workshops and stuff. Whereas it would be like a once in a lifetime thing to do, I&#8217;ll take this trip one time an hour for this workshop, but don&#8217;t count on me to come every week.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And the web is going to change things too. I mean, there&#8217;s events and workshops and things. A lot of stuff has come online just over the past year that before either didn&#8217;t exist or it was just inaccessible because of location or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. Adobe MAX, the first time I attended it was last year because it was virtual. I lived in LA and it happened there every year, but I just was not about to sit there and pay for it not only, but just go there and talk designer talk. Sometimes I feel like there could be a prestige that some people might have, like, hello, I&#8217;m art designer. I integrate things together. They use all the design words and I&#8217;m not very good at that. I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Yeah, make pictures.&#8221; So being in that environment isn&#8217;t something I would want to pay to do. So it was nice to be able to attend the virtual version because I never would have went otherwise. Yes, there were so many conferences and things I&#8217;ve never heard about that I got to hear about because it was virtual and people I got to meet because of that, which is nice to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. As I was going through your work, I saw your illustration work and your portrait work, which is beautiful, but your patterns, the patterns on your website are absolutely gorgeous. I love that you have in your bio, on your website, you mentioned that you&#8217;re an artist and designer depicting joy. What does it mean for you to depict joy in your work?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. So in terms of people, you&#8217;ll probably see that I draw a lot of black people. And one thing that makes me happy about black culture and just black people in general is just seeing us love the things that we love, however we love it. It just makes me really happy to see all the different facets and ways that black people just are. I get so excited. And I feel like when I draw that, that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m trying to convey just how excited I am to see black people as they are, doing whatever they like, looking as cool or as goofy or as happy as they are. I feel like that comes through with the people.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
And in terms of the patterns, I really like music. But when I hear music, I tend to see a lot of different shapes and colors just moving together. That&#8217;s how I see the song. Like me drawing those abstract patterns, it&#8217;s usually me listening to music and drawing whatever comes to mind. So just kind of like the happiness that comes from listening to music, that energy is something I&#8217;m trying to capture in the patterns. And I like for it to fit together kind of like different sounds fit together in a song, that&#8217;s how it shows up in the patterns.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And when you&#8217;re even doing these patterns, it also seems like you&#8217;re drawing from nature some too. I don&#8217;t know maybe if that was just the particular collection that you were doing, but I saw a lot of kind of tropical themes and leaves and stuff like that. It&#8217;s just very, very stunning work.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Thank you. Yeah, the tropical thing is I just love the way tropical scenery looks. I also think it&#8217;s nice, like all the different leaves and like patterns that you see within leaves, I think that&#8217;s nice as well, but also sometimes, if I draw too many triangles and circles, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Let me draw something that people can recognize.&#8221; So it ends up just being leaves and flowers for some reason. I&#8217;m not even a big flower person, it just ends up coming out, or I&#8217;ll just look up pictures of flowers. But yeah, I really love tropical weather and themes and stuff. So I just end up drawing it a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I have not met a Nigerian that didn&#8217;t like bright colors. So you&#8217;re definitely onto something there.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:35:22]. I love that. You&#8217;re right. You&#8217;re right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you get your creativity back if you are feeling uninspired, like say you hit a block in a project somewhere you&#8217;re working on something, what do you do to get that spark back?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
So when I am inspired, I have a bunch of hidden Pinterest boards. And then I also have a notebook where when I&#8217;m inspired, I just write down ideas of things that I think will be cool to make. So when I am feeling blocked or uninspired, I&#8217;ll look through that Pinterest board. One is just called Black, and it&#8217;s just black people, just random black people that I can find on Pinterest. It used to be really hard, but I saved so many pictures and looked at it that Pinterest has realized this girl likes to look here black people. So now my homepage has that.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
So I&#8217;ll either look at that Pinterest board, just kind of seeing people do stuff or I also have some with just colors or textures or shapes. I&#8217;ll just look through the Pinterest board or I&#8217;ll look through that list of ideas that I have. I&#8217;ll either do that or I&#8217;ll just take a break. Turn the thing off, turn the computer off, turn the iPad off, watch TV, play a video game, take a nap and then come back. Yeah. And then if there&#8217;s like a time crunch, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;Well, honestly, think about the money.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Girl, do you want to get paid?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; So I just do it no matter what I&#8217;m like, okay. Just loosen up. Then I&#8217;ll take a five minute break, loosen up, get some water or something and then come back and just do it.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Or another thing I&#8217;ll do, sometimes I&#8217;m not a good singer, but I love to sing. So I&#8217;ll just turn on Spotify and then just force myself to sing along out loud as bad as it&#8217;s going to come out, just so to get my mind not overthinking it. And then things usually come out better. If I have, like my mind is focused on me singing, even though like, what notes? What notes am I hitting? So that helps me have a bit of more energy and looseness to the art that I&#8217;m making.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One thing that I would do when I was working on projects is I&#8217;d always build in at least a week into the sort of like project plan, because I mean, I think the expectation, certainly, I think from clients, but oftentimes, for us as freelances, as designers, the expectation is we&#8217;ll get the work and we&#8217;ll just be able to knock it out, like we&#8217;ll sit down and we&#8217;ll know what we do because the client has brought us on for our expertise. So we have to be the expert.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I mean, depending on how, if you set up a project rate or hourly rate or a day rate or whatever, sometimes clients will try to nickel and dime you to try to know like, well, how long did it take you to work on X, Y, Z, and blah, blah, blah? And I certainly early on in my freelance career, that was a mistake that I made. And then eventually, I switched things over either to like a project rate or I do like a day rate or something like that. I&#8217;d build in like a week of time because there&#8217;s no telling.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And for me, it&#8217;s almost like creative insurance, like I may need it in the future if something happens, like what if I get sick? Or what if I just am not feeling it? And I can take that time out of the bank sort of because I&#8217;ve built it into the project and then I can, like if I take a day off and then decide to come back later and do it, then that way I&#8217;m not impacting the project because I built that time in there. It gives me permission to not have to be a machine when it comes to like creativity because sometimes the ideas flow and sometimes they just don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;ve certainly been at that place where you&#8217;re at, where you&#8217;re like, you just have to think about the money, like think about what this is going to do. And then you soldier on or you push through it. But yeah, that&#8217;s one thing that I would do is I just build in the time because the good thing is if you never use it, then you come out early and the client is happy. And then if you do use it, the client is still happy because you came out on time.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Right. That&#8217;s great. Because I learned in the design world as well, especially when I was at that media buying agency, it was an open office and there were only like eight of us. So sometimes I&#8217;ll work on stuff, they just be standing over my shoulder, &#8220;How long do you think it&#8217;ll take?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Please. Oh, I think it&#8217;ll take me a few hours rolling.&#8221; It wouldn&#8217;t. It would take me shorter than that, but I like to add in that buffer, just like you said, like if something happens, I can still turn it in when I said I could, but also giving myself that insurance, like you said, to make it.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
But in terms of the illustration projects now, those few hours turns into a couple of extra days or maybe an extra week, like you said. Yeah. Especially when people say they have a tight turnaround, things never are as tight as people want it to be, especially with getting revisions and just getting feedback, especially if there are a lot of cooks in the kitchen. So it is way better to add in more time for that kind of stuff in the beginning, like you said.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now when you were in school, when you were back at North Carolina State, let&#8217;s say, I think that was maybe probably around 10 years ago at this point, right?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where did you see yourself career-wise by this age where you&#8217;re at now?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Honestly, by the time I graduated, I was just like, &#8220;Am I cut out for this?&#8221; Honestly, because I thought, again, like when I was 18 entering college, I thought, okay, college is going to give me the roadmap. And by the time I am a senior, I&#8217;m going to know exactly what I want to do, how to get there and I&#8217;ll be able to get there. But that didn&#8217;t happen when I was a senior. I felt kind of similar to how I was as a freshman, like, what? Like, what am I doing? I need to find a job.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
So I mainly, the main goal I had, I was like, Keisha, please have a job, please have a job and an apartment that you can pay for with your job. I had very, very basic goals for myself, have a job that&#8217;s something related to design. Yeah, that was pretty much my only goal. I wanted, the idea of freelance sounded good, but then at that time, I had no idea how to do it. So it wasn&#8217;t even, it was more like a fantasy more than like me seeing myself there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I didn&#8217;t go to design school, but it is something that I&#8217;ve thought about in terms of like, do I need this in order to have this legitimacy for myself as a designer? Because I&#8217;ve been self-taught and I did a little bit of work at companies, like I worked for the State of Georgia for a while, I worked at AT&#038;T for a while. And then like, I really had just felt like, you know what? I got this, I could start my own studio and do this and really do it myself. And I&#8217;ve learned so much really just in the time that I had my studio doing things by myself, but they never really teach you entrepreneurship. I mean, again, I didn&#8217;t go to design school, but even with the work that I was doing, by the time I started my studio, I had a bachelor&#8217;s and a master&#8217;s degree and still didn&#8217;t know anything about freelancing. I was really either making it up as I went along or I was asking other freelances. I was really gaining this education while I was also trying to run my business.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Absolutely. Because in design school, in my senior year, we had this class that the description was literally, we&#8217;re going to prepare you to get a job. But when we actually took the class, they were like, &#8220;You need a website. Do you know what a website is? You can make websites on Squarespace.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Are you kidding me? This is my senior year and you&#8217;re teaching us that we need a website. Of course, we do. What are you talking about? How do you get a job? Please tell me what to put on my resume and how to get the people to actually hire me.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Even then, like being in design school didn&#8217;t make that difference. It&#8217;s almost like they&#8217;re out of touch with what was happening in the world. Like they got the art skills, but getting a job or even being an entrepreneur, that wasn&#8217;t even close to being thought about in any of my classes. I would have had to talk to alumni who are already doing it. And kind of like you said, they were figuring it out on their own or like having outside resources to figure that out. So I definitely don&#8217;t think going to design school will or not going to design school, you won&#8217;t really be missing out honestly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, by the time I really started figuring it out, I think I was about, I don&#8217;t know, I think maybe I was about two or three years into my studio and from just talking with other freelancers and picking up, because sometimes you just have to get, unfortunately, you just have to get burned a few times in business before you learn that lesson or whatever that particular lesson is. But I think by the time I was like, by the time I hit my fifth year, I had it down pat at that point, I knew about contracts and proposals and getting things done and everything just ran smoothly, but it took some time to get there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So yeah. I think now, because freelancing is an option for so many people, whether they do it either independently, like you&#8217;re doing, or if they do something like working via like a design marketplace, such as ThemeForest or Envato Elements or Envato Market, whatever the thing is that Envato has with all of the different websites and stuff, Fiverr, even those kinds of things, Upwork, there&#8217;s ways that you can use those tools to manage your business better, but it&#8217;s still, at the end of the day, it comes down to really knowing what those fundamentals are and knowing what works best for you. I think certainly, when I was doing business, there&#8217;s not an all-purpose solution for like being an entrepreneur. I wish there was. But once you learn what works for you in terms of cashflow and payments and client communication and everything, then you&#8217;ve cracked it, you&#8217;ve cracked the code pretty much.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. A lot of the stuff I&#8217;ve learned even about graphic design because NC State does have a graphic design major, but I majored in art and design, a lot of the stuff I learned about graphic design was just learning by doing. It ended up being like the jobs I had, more doing stuff for family and friends was really the stuff that prepared me for the different jobs. And I&#8217;m learning that that&#8217;s the same thing that&#8217;s happening with freelance as well, like the classes that I take, the people, the Instagram artists that I&#8217;ll DM or Instagram friends I have, I&#8217;ll DM, those things have been really helpful. And also, like you said, being burnt, having bad clients, that helps me set better boundaries for future clients, like knowing what to do. So yeah, that&#8217;s definitely something I&#8217;m in the process of right now. I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to the part where everything runs itself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;ll get there probably I think sooner than you expect. Before you know it, it&#8217;ll just flow. It&#8217;s sort of like a&#8230; I mean, you watch anime, it&#8217;s like the Avatar State. Eventually, you&#8217;ll be able to just invoke it and you&#8217;ll be good.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Awesome. Avatar is one of my favorite shows. So I love that you said the Avatar State.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are you obsessed with at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Speaking of anime, so I&#8217;m watching this anime called Fruits Basket. It&#8217;s a silly premise. When it&#8217;s like, if you hug someone of the opposite gender, they will turn into Zodiac animal, so like the Year of the Horse, or a cat, rat, like things like that. But you end up finding out everyone has these crazy backstories and there&#8217;s this whole curse and things like that. So I&#8217;ve just been binge-watching that show basically, because I&#8217;m so curious to see what&#8217;s happening. Other than that, I&#8217;ve been playing a video game called Mario &#038; Sonic at The Olympic Games for 2020. I&#8217;ve just been going through the story mode. There was one, it&#8217;s the triple jump and I keep getting disqualified. So I got mad and turned it off, but I still think about it because I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to win.&#8221; Yeah. I would say those two things.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Also, I have a cat. I&#8217;ve never had a pet before, but I got one a few months ago, honestly, off the strength of seeing other black people on social media have cats and they seem to enjoy it. And I always wanted a cat. So I ended up getting one. So I spend a lot of time peeking over the couch, seeing what she&#8217;s doing or looking for her around the house and just smiling really big. She gets annoyed, but I think she&#8217;s used to it. I would say I&#8217;m pretty obsessed with her.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Do you have like a dream project that you would love to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a great question. I would say the only dream project I had, I got to do it last year. So I got to illustrate a deck of playing cards and I pretty much did the art direction for the whole thing. So you mentioned the tropical idea, there was a running idea I had for a long time of joining black people in the tropical space, kind of like an oasis, a place where they could freely celebrate themselves without all the isms in the world that black people carry. So I pretty much made the deck around that and got the job black people being happy or silly in that tropical environment. And that was something I really enjoy doing. If I think of like a future project, it would be a similar thing, but in a different format. I haven&#8217;t figured that out yet, but definitely enjoyed doing that deck of cards, but I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s like a book or like a coffee book or like a storybook, but that&#8217;s kind of like something that I&#8217;m juggling in my head right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is the best advice that you&#8217;ve ever been given regarding what you do as an illustrator?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Interestingly enough, I would say the best advice I have is more of like a you as a person. So like, not finding your identity in the work that you do, you&#8217;re more than the work that you do. You are enough as you are. Like those kinds of things I&#8217;ve seen have made the biggest difference for me. Yeah, a lot of times the artsy-fartsy, mumbo-jumbo, it just slides off of me. I&#8217;m just like, this sounds, but when I draw, what does that mean? So hearing things like, I&#8217;m more than the art that I make is very freeing for me to be able to just have fun with it and do stuff that I like. And I don&#8217;t have to judge myself based on how well I drew today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I can see how that, I mean, well, one, I see that is good advice just in general, like, make sure that you don&#8217;t get too caught up in the work, but also realize that you put your own identity into everything that you do as well.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next like five years? Like this whole pandemic craziness is over with, it&#8217;s 20, what? 2026. What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Honestly, I haven&#8217;t thought that far ahead. I was like, &#8220;Will the world still be turning at that time?&#8221; I think it would be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I hope so.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
You&#8217;re right. Me too. Honestly, I hope I&#8217;ll be doing bigger projects, projects I&#8217;m really excited about. I&#8217;m enjoying the projects that I&#8217;m doing right now. So more, just like an extension of the kinds of things I&#8217;m doing right now getting to illustrate different people, doing things, really hoping to get into the Children&#8217;s Book World, be able to illustrate them to children&#8217;s books. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;m looking forward to. And also, I want to get my patterns onto products. So one thing I&#8217;m hoping to do also in five years is to have my products on things. Yeah. More of like, just like all the different ways I can get my work out there, either on products or online in different formats. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;m hoping will happen, just as I grow and do things and get better at art, have it just spread onto different formats as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything that you&#8217;re doing online?</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Yeah. So you can find my work on my website, which is keishaokafor.com, O-K-A-F-O-R. You can also find me on social media on Twitter and Instagram, mostly Instagram @keishaoak, oak as in oak tree, O-A-K. The reason why it&#8217;s like that is just so you know how to pronounce Okafor. But yeah, that&#8217;s pretty much where I&#8217;m at, Instagram, Twitter and my website.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Keisha Okafor, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I have to say, I just love how joyful and colorful and vibrant your work is. Like I mentioned, when I discovered you from the work that you did at YouTube, I was just looking at your website, like, this is so fun. And I have to say that it&#8217;s rare to see a designer put that sort of joy into their work, but I am really excited to see what sort of work you&#8217;ll be doing after this interview, after people get a chance to really see your work, because I feel like this sort of vibrancy and joy in life is what we need right now. We need to be seeing more of this everywhere. And so I&#8217;m excited for people to really learn more about you and learn more about your work. And yeah, just thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Keisha Okafor:</b><br>
Thank you for having me. I am hope, really excited for people to see my work too. And I really appreciate all your kind words. Yeah, I definitely, I&#8217;m just like, if I&#8217;m going to draw, I&#8217;m going to have fun with it and I want everyone else to have fun with it too. So definitely excited to see where it all goes.</p>

<p>What happens when a Trini woman ends up in the largest city in Switzerland to learn design? You have Cherry-Ann Davis, a graduate design student at Zurich University of the Arts, and a self-proclaimed creator of visuals and words. Quite a combination, right?</p>
<p>Cherry-Ann and I talk about her design thesis, as well as her work at a feminist design publication called <a href="https://futuress.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The Futuress</a>. Cherry-Ann also spoke on growing up in Trinidad and Tobago, how she switched her career from marketing to design, and spoke on finding community in an entirely new place. According to Cherry-Ann, you should stay open to anything because you&#8217;ll never know where it will take you. I can&#8217;t argue with that!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
I am Cherry-Ann Davis and I am currently a master&#8217;s student at Zurich University of the Arts studying visual communication design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And Zurich, that&#8217;s Zurich as in Switzerland, correct?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Yes. Zurich as in Switzerland. I left my good hot island in the Caribbean to Zurich, another part of the world that I&#8217;ve not been before. Well, first of all, I never left my country for longer than a week before moving to Switzerland.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. And you&#8217;ve been there&#8230; I think you told me earlier, you&#8217;ve been there since February of last year.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Yes. February 1st, 2020, I moved, I packed my four suitcases. It&#8217;s everything that I won and I hold dear in my life, and I brought with me. So many books. And I came by myself into a new world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s it been adjusting to everything?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Well, one months after arriving, there was a global lockdown. So that adjustment period was quite hard because I didn&#8217;t know anybody. The one person that I knew, he kind of dropped me as soon as I got to Switzerland. So I was in a pandemic by myself, not knowing anyone in a flat with two other people upstairs.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And the people who were on my floor left, they went back to their countries to spend quarantine with their families, to spend that time. And I was just there by myself. Being new to school, not even having time to meet my classmates and get to know them. It was rough. It was real hard.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
My goodness. I can only imagine. How did you get through that? Well, I mean, I guess you&#8217;re kind of still getting through it, right?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
I am still getting through it. Enough prayers. I prayed a lot and I spoke to my therapist a lot, because as much as I was prepared mentally to move to another country, I was not prepared mentally to move to another country and be in so much isolation. Although I lived on my own when I was back in Trinidad, it was something that I could not comprehend.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
As we&#8217;re recording this, so for people that know, we&#8217;re recording this right before Memorial day, so right near the end of May. What&#8217;s the situation like in Zurich or in Switzerland, I guess, as it relates to reopening or anything?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Right now, next Monday, all of the restaurants will be reopening to have both inside and outside guests. So for the last two weeks, they were just having people, they could dine on the patios or outside of your restaurants. But from this Monday, all the restaurants will be opened for both seating inside and outside. That is mainly because there&#8217;s a big drive to get people vaccinated.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
I had my last shots yesterday and I&#8217;m scared as fuck because I&#8217;m thinking about all of the history with vaccination and being Black, and I&#8217;m in a predominantly White country. So my fear is just going off the radar right now. But Zurich is one of the cities that has opened up vaccination for all persons no matter your age group or your risk right now. So with that, they are trying to open more and more. Relaxing measures more and more. Sorry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Which vaccine did you get?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
I am not sure. I think it&#8217;s Moderna, but it might be AstraZeneca. I can&#8217;t remember. I was so nervous when they were telling me, I kind of blanked out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I mean, but it was one you had to get two shots for?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So it was probably Moderna. I think actually those might be the only two shots that are available globally. I don&#8217;t know if Pfizer is or not. I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
I think when talking to some of my friends yesterday, Pfizer was available in a different part of Switzerland. So Switzerland is actually&#8230; Well, Zurich is actually larger than my country. So at different parts of Zurich, you could get a different vaccine. So I&#8217;m just like, wow, that&#8217;s weird.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean all these news, and I&#8217;ve mentioned this on the show before. So for folks listening, I&#8217;m not trying to belabor the point, but I mean, all of the news around this has just been changing week after week, whether it&#8217;s availability, or restrictions and things opening up. There&#8217;s been such a rush back here in America, in the U.S. for things to reopen that it&#8217;s kind of staggering.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, it was so interesting because I remember this time last year, there was so much about making sure people wash their hands for 20 seconds and wore a mask. And now that it&#8217;s masks off, I mean, everywhere, people are just&#8230; It&#8217;s going to be a wild summer in the United States because people are ready to get out.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Right now I get scared when I&#8217;m on the tram when I see someone not wearing a mask, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yo, so what are you doing? This is Corona.&#8221; And for me, it&#8217;s kind of baffling because back home in Trinidad, right now there&#8217;s a state of emergency. You can&#8217;t go anywhere between 9:00 and 6:00. And if you are going anyway outside of those hours, you have to have a good reason as well to be outdoors.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
You can&#8217;t exercise outdoors. I feel it for the people back home. And here I am having the opportunity to get a vaccine even because back home, they ran out of vaccines, and I am here with so much privilege and this man not wearing his mask, like what are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I know some Europeans that came, they flew over here last month to get the vaccine because the country that they were in, it didn&#8217;t seem that it was going to be available or they didn&#8217;t really have a sense of when the vaccines would be available. So they just flew over here, got it, and that was it.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Well, that&#8217;s an ability that very few have, that access to even leave your own country to get a vaccine. People don&#8217;t realize that privilege. I have friends in Berlin and they can&#8217;t even get the vaccine.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think now it appears that vaccines are starting to get out to more countries from the U.S. because right now we&#8217;re at this point where supply is greatly outpacing demand. And partly that&#8217;s because prior to, I want to say maybe a couple of weeks ago, you really had to go to mass vaccination sites or maybe get them through your doctor or something, but now you can get them at pretty much any pharmacy. You can get it at-</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Really?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. The availability has increased a lot. But even with that, some people, because it&#8217;s a&#8230; If they do a two shot like Pfizer or Moderna, they&#8217;re only getting the first shot and not the second one because people are talking about side effects and everything.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
That was one of the things that was happening in Trinidad. So before I think they ran out of the vaccines, a few people who are in the high-risk area, they were able to get the flu shot, and then they ran out of vaccine. So it was like, what&#8217;s going to happen now that they need to get a second shot. Do they know after wait to get the same brand of shots or would they get a second shot from another brand of medication? So it&#8217;s questions, just big question marks in Trinidad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, let&#8217;s shift the conversation away from vaccines and all that sort of stuff. Talk to me about what you&#8217;re studying. You said you&#8217;re at the Zurich Institute for the Arts. Is that what it was?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Zurich University of the Arts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Zurich University of the Arts. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Yes. I am doing visual communication design. I came with the intention of doing a project around pattern design on Trinidad and Tobago. Because I had so much time during Corona and I have to have a thesis to go along with my artifacts, I was able to think a little bit deeper into what I want my project to be, because I initially, I was just thinking about the diversity and the culture of Trinidad and Tobago being represented in some type of pattern design for fabric or wallpaper.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
I told my interviewers when I was applying for the school, that will love to see a line of IKEA wallpapers that just shows the brilliance and vibrance of Trinidad and Tobago through pattern design, and he said, &#8220;Yes. We have partners in IKEA.&#8221; And I said, yes, that&#8217;s what I want my project to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And during lockdown, I had way too much time on my hands, and I got to thinking, what does a pattern design actually say? And how does it benefit the design industry? And what would my thesis say? And what am I adding to the conversation? So it changed. It pivoted from being pattern design of Trinidad and Tobago as a thesis on the artifact, to the thesis now looking at how can designers who are not part of the Western world utilize their own culture to create inspiration for designs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a really rich subject to go into.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Yeah. For me, it&#8217;s something that I wanted when I was doing corporate design because I worked at a bank that was throughout the Caribbean. So we were operating in 17 islands at the time, and I was responsible for all of the visuals. So all of the marketing campaigns. I was responsible for creating the ads whether it was digital, or print, or even TV ads, I would be the person who would give approval along with my colleagues in Canada.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And a lot of times, my colleagues in Canada, I remember this one meeting, it was for a Christmas campaign, and they proposed an idea and I was the one reviewing it and providing the Caribbean context. And they were like, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re not sure if you all have hardwood floors and you all use Christmas trees.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What do you mean if we have hardwood floors? Where do you think we live? On the beach and swinging from tree to tree? We have hardwood floors. We have tiled floors. We have [inaudible 00:15:42] just like everybody else.&#8221; And I basically had to let them know, hey, as much as you think that your view of things are better and your ideas are wrong, design, or even life, maybe more rich because of your position in Western world, we still have access to all of these things too.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Just do a simple Google search, and you&#8217;ll see how rich our countries are. And from that is where a seed was planted. Because so many times us as designers who don&#8217;t belong to the Western world, we still have to conform to a lot of the Western canon on how to design, on how we should market our products to people. And we most of the times don&#8217;t consider our audience, which is the people that we&#8217;re advertising to. They are also rich with diversity that we should reflect in our ads as well. So that was where the idea was based in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think that&#8217;s a marvelous idea. And it&#8217;s something that at least I know here in the States, there&#8217;s been a lot of talk around decolonizing design, which is sort of trying to free people&#8217;s mindsets away from honestly, from a Eurocentric vision of design like Swiss design, or German design, or French design, or whatever, by trying to free yourself from that and learn about designers from other cultures or even designers from different races so you can sort of add to your own design, knowledge, and research, and inspiration to create bigger and better things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There was a couple of weeks ago we had Kaleena Sales, who teaches at Tennessee State University. And one of the focuses that she has for her work when she&#8217;s talking to her students and teaching her students is having them plum their own culture to put it into their work because she teaches at a historically Black college. Her students are Black. She&#8217;s Black. So that&#8217;s where you should be pulling from for your design, instead of trying to mimic, I don&#8217;t know, the Bauhaus or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Yes. For me, I actually strengthened my idea in the BIPOC Design History course that was run by Polymode. So Silas Monroe and some other lecturers came together and they presented what a canon would look like if African-Americans were included in it. And for me, that opened my eyes to think, so why didn&#8217;t I learn about my own design history in school? I remember my design teacher always mentioning to us that good design is very clean and very Scandinavian or Swiss.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m like, but we have kind of more. We have so much color, and richness, and diversity. Why can&#8217;t I include that into my own designs? And for me, my thesis is more about showing designers that it can happen because I&#8217;m utilizing my own country, so Trinidad and Tobago, and our rich diversity, and history, and culture, and language in my artifact. So it&#8217;s more leaning towards a case study of how you can do it.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s not just the theory around decolonization and postcoloniality. It is there, but it is centered in, this is what it is. This is how we do it. So many times when people do master&#8217;s and PhDs, it&#8217;s so academic level that a practitioner can&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s happening. And I want me, as a 22 year old designer, or aspiring designer to be able to say, I understand what she&#8217;s saying. I could do that. Now let me implement it in my own design processes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a really smart way to think about it. And you&#8217;re right. I mean, I know when I think about Trinidad and Tobago, because I went to college here in Atlanta, but we had a ton of Caribbean students, mostly from Trinidad and Tobago. And even just talking with them and hearing them talk about home, and the richness of their culture, and the food, and the music, and everything, why wouldn&#8217;t you want to infuse that into your design because that&#8217;s what you get inspired by.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Yeah. There was a lecture recently at a workshop that I&#8217;m co-curating with the futurist, and Toshika Arno Sutton was there, and she was also part of the BIPAC Design History. And she presented an exercise that she did in her degree program, and it was around the genealogy of design. And she infused in it her musical influences, her literary influences, the designers that made sense to her that time.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And she mentioned that throughout, she noticed all of her non-design inspirations were of Black culture, but her design inspiration was not of Black culture because there were no Black designers that she was aware of at the time. And that&#8217;s when she pivoted her direction. And that&#8217;s part of my research so far. I&#8217;ve been interviewing my mentor, who is one of the lecturers in Trinidad who teaches almost all of the professional designers.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And she has been teaching for the last 30 odd years at the [inaudible 00:21:15] Institute. And she has said&#8230; Well, in the interview, she said, &#8220;Well, yes, we have our culture, but there&#8217;s a standards to design, there are rules design.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Miss, but we have rules, but shouldn&#8217;t we be allowed to interpret the rules through our lenses that we live.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And she says, &#8220;Yes, Cherry, your visual vocabulary and your life experiences should influence how you design, but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s still based on what the clients want.&#8221; And that kind of broke my heart a little bit because I am there thinking as much as I am following the brief of a client, if my audience is in Trinidad, it should reflect my audience more than the rules of design.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Right now, tethering on should I even think about what decolonizing design should be? Or should I just say they are the rules of design and you could break it, but not too much right now. So it&#8217;s a confusing space to me as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can see. I mean, I don&#8217;t know. My advice is to break it, that&#8217;s just me, but also I didn&#8217;t go to design school. So maybe don&#8217;t listen to that. But I mean, I can see where that conundrum exists. You definitely want to pull from what you know, but, wow, that&#8217;s so interesting. That&#8217;s so interesting to hear. I want to talk about the Futurist since you mentioned it. Can you talk about what it is and sort of what attracted you to it?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So The Futurist is a para academic organization. So it&#8217;s an Institute that provides guidance for writers and that&#8217;s how I initially engaged with it. So last year in 2020, there was a workshop called Troublemakers. It&#8217;s the second workshop that was held. And it&#8217;s basically any format of an online course, as well as a writing workshop for students who want to be a part of a community of let&#8217;s say troublemakers, literally.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So we are the ones who are doing texts on difficult subjects and themes that most universities don&#8217;t necessarily want to get involved with or get too deep in because it&#8217;s a hard topic to navigate. So for me, a Trinidadian being in a Swiss design school, and one of my professors actually asking me, &#8220;So what&#8217;s the difference between your work as a Trinidadian and a Jamaican student who was enrolled at the time?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
I was like, &#8220;Well, She&#8217;s from Jamaica.&#8221; Those simple things that I needed a community to even understand some of the terms that I needed to negotiate, and Futurist was that community. So I started off in futurist as participants in a workshop, and I messaged and I said, hey, I want to be a part of this. If you need an intern, I&#8217;m available.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
I have a lots of free time next year because I&#8217;m extending my studies and I want to be a part of this. And at the beginning of this year, I was looking for a job and I just came out of an interview to be a nanny for two kids. And I was like, Cherry, you can&#8217;t be on nanny for nobody children because you don&#8217;t have that level of patience. You have two degrees, and the moment somebody child turn to you and shout a little too loud, your Caribbean instinct might hit in and you might want to discipline the child.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And this is not Trinidad. People won&#8217;t understand this. And at that moment negotiating these thoughts with myself to not say yes to that type of job, I got an email from Nina and she was like, &#8220;Cherry, are you still interested in being an intern?&#8221; I was like, thank you, Jesus. You know my heart. And at that moment, I was like ,&#8221;Yes. Hell yes. I will send on my resume.&#8221; And she was so impressed with how I was in the workshop with my texts.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So at the workshop, you present a text that you want to work on for three months period, and within that period, you help&#8230; What was the word I&#8217;m looking for? You help other participants by reviewing their texts as well. So it&#8217;s a peer review, but under the guidance of added time three persons who were at The Futurist.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So in that, you give feedback to your partners, but you&#8217;re in a group of about six or seven persons and any group, you all just provide feedback on each other&#8217;s texts. And throughout, I was always able to provide guidance, or provide suggestions, or there was always a rapport of me helping. And that led to me being open and able to be a part of The Futurist. And this year, I co curated. So I came up with the program along with Nina, which is against the grain. It&#8217;s an online course, as well as the writing fellowship.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m looking at it now on the website and it says it&#8217;s an online course and fellowship program fostering critical perspectives on the designed past and democratizing access to design history writing in a broad sense. I love that The Futurist&#8217;s focus is on design politics and design writing. Is that just sort of born out of what Nina, who is the, I guess she&#8217;s what, the founder of Futurist?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that sort of born out of what she wanted to do or did you see this more as a community need?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
It&#8217;s both. So the first aspect for all of our online workshops is we create a theme, and from the theme, we invite persons to sign up for the online course. This is the third iteration. And for this iteration, it was a payment for the persons who wanted to participate in the online course, and in your participation to the online course, you will be sponsoring the persons who wanted to take part in the writing course.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And this worked out really well because we were able to open the online course for more persons, as well as the writing course for 42 persons who are writing critical design theory texts. And this format provides also a community. We operate on slack mainly. So we have a community of over 250 persons. Any slack group for just this one workshop against the grain.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And last workshop, which was troublemakers, we had 50 persons, and this workshop was mainly focused on writing. But with this new iteration, we were able to do a bit more and open up the community to a larger amount of people. So we have people from seven continents all over.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Seven, even Antarctica?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Okay. Maybe not seven continents.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was going to say, if you all got a research scientist or some penguins or something, that&#8217;s pretty dope.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
But we do have one person doing research on the Dodo bird, which is quite interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love that the focus is on writing. And I guess the, I don&#8217;t know, eventually those pieces will get published on Futurist once they&#8217;re through with this workshop.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Yes. So this is a format that has moved from the first workshop, which was The L.i.P. Collective, very focused on feminists writing throughout a period, and then truly troublemakers, a lot of the pieces are still being published. And with against the grain, this would provide texts that will be published on The Futurist.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So a lot of times when people do master&#8217;s research and they put their life into this, they put the two years worst of knowledge into this, it just sits in a drawer somewhere and nobody reads it. As much passion that is imbued in this work, nobody reads it. Nobody gets to see this research and Futurist provides the opportunity for this research to be viewed by as many persons as possible. And I think that&#8217;s one of the best things.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And I could access to this as well because my text, as part of the troublemakers, was published recently. It is called Culture No Context where I was looking at the ethics of ethnographic museums. So I had a lot of beef with ethnographic museums when I came to Switzerland and I went to a couple. I was able to process that through the workshop, and it&#8217;s also part of my thesis for my master&#8217;s as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What is an ethnographic museum?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So ethnographic museums are museums that take cultural artifacts and displays in a artistic sense. So if you think of textiles or sculptural pieces from Africa, India, Oceana, South America, all of these things will be just on display in an ethnographic museum. Sometimes it may be a range and gallery style. So it might be curated for a collection, or it might just be in their archives open for people to view, which is another thing that was hard for me to deal with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting. Wow. I want to break a little bit from talking about, of course, your journey and the work that you&#8217;re doing in Switzerland just to go back to Trinidad and Tobago for a minute. Talk about what it was like growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Well, Trinidad and Tobago is the most beautiful place. Everybody will tell you their island nice, but my island real, real nice. But I grew up in [inaudible 00:31:24], which is a place that the news always portrays as one of the worst place in Trinidad and Tobago. That wasn&#8217;t really my experience. I experienced community. I experienced people looking out for each other.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Yes, there is violence in our communities, but it&#8217;s not as much as the news reports it to be. And I&#8217;ve always had this view that, hey, maybe what you read on the news is not always true, because it wasn&#8217;t always my lived experience. I went to school in places that people will associate as the worst areas of Port of Spain. So there&#8217;s a part of Port of Spain that people call wrongly bridge.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So there&#8217;s Picton, Nelson Street and Bethlehem Girls. These were three primary schools in the area and I went to Bethlehem Girls, and I fell in love with art in the primary schools of Bethlehem Girls in our area where there were people tune in ponds, people making mass costumes. There was always creativity and vibrance in every aspect of my life. Move on love.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And until is places where the pan came from, which is in national instruments. And carnival really is boosted in these areas that people don&#8217;t like the most. And I&#8217;ve always had a idea that, and creativity is born in the places where struggle is also overwhelmingly popular.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What it sounds like is that you grew up around a lot of creativity and ingenuity from these so-called rough neighborhoods or these rough places.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Yeah. There was so much ingenuity because you had to find ways to survive. You had to find ways to make money. You had to find ways in order to feed your family. My grandmother used to sell in a markets every weekend, and I used to be there with her. I had my own little stalls selling my own little things, trying to make money for my own self.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And at that time, I didn&#8217;t understand that she was teaching me about business on how to invite people so that you could sell them your products over the person next to you who may have the same products. And many times she would tell me to draw a sign and put the price and everybody else would just have the number $2 for a [inaudible 00:33:51] tomatoes.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
I would take my time and I would draw it and I would put little sunflowers around it. And these little things, I think it may not have helped. But I think to myself that these may have invited people to come to our stall to buy more things. But in different ways, creativity was always around me.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
But sometimes I wasn&#8217;t aware of it at the time. And hindsight, it&#8217;s not 2020 anymore. Hindsight, is really you think that it makes you realize, hey, the lesson that you didn&#8217;t learn then, you&#8217;re learning now. We&#8217;re not talking about 2020 anymore.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, when you were in Trinidad and Tobago, you started out at the College of Science and Technology and Applied Arts, and later you finished up at the University of Trinidad and Tobago. I&#8217;m totally basing this off of your LinkedIn. So please feel free to chime in and correct me if I&#8217;m wrong. But you kind of made this switch from marketing to design. Where did that shift come in?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
As a teenager, after my grandmother passed away, I moved in with my uncle and aunt and they really pushed me more towards the business side because I was always two minds about either business or art. I did both in high school. So I had to pay to do art because it wasn&#8217;t offered with the subjects that I wanted. So art was always something on the periphery. And they really encouraged me to go more to the business side.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And I was like, well, if you&#8217;re sending me to do business, I&#8217;ll do business that I like, which was marketing at that time. I started in 2006, and at that time, the governments of Trinidad actually provided free tertiary education for all citizens. So you could go to college for free. And I went, and I got my associate degree in marketing, but then I decided maybe I could switch to art.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So I got a diploma and visual communication design. At that time I was like, what do I do next? I decided that I will go finish my degree in business because I am the type of person that once I start something, I like to finish it. So I wanted to get my degree in business. That was the moment I realized I don&#8217;t like business, having to do human resource management and organizational principles.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
I&#8217;m the person who, as much as I can memorize theory, I like to be able to explain it and I could create a story out of it and not repeat it word for word. So that did not work out too well for me in those exams, but I passed, and I realized my passion really lies within being creative and telling stories.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And if I could do that visually, I&#8217;ll go back and get my degree in visual communication design. So after my business degree, I got my degree in graphic design at the same university. And it was a distance learning program. So it was a university in Sunderland in the UK, but there was a center in Trinidad that you go to and you would get the same qualifications.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So after you are studying and you make the switch to graphic design, and you&#8217;re doing that, what was your early career like after you graduated?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Well, after I graduated with my marketing associate degree, I got a job in a bank as an office assistant. So all of the other degrees, which is visual communication, and my two bachelor&#8217;s, those were done part-time. So I worked during the day and I went to school at night, which I will not recommend to anybody unless you have a lot of heart and determination.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
It was extremely difficult at that time. I was grateful that my job required no brainpower. So as an office assistant, I was basically just filing papers, enter drawers for the entire day. And then three years later, I got a promotion to an administrative assistant where I also had to deal with running the department.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So making sure all of the office supplies were in order and making sure all of the managers had whatever they need for meetings. That is when I realized I cannot do this office administration thing anymore. Some managers just don&#8217;t know how to speak to people, especially when they think that they are in a lower position than them.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And many times, I wanted to curse out my managers, but I remember that I had a job that paid for my degree and paid for all the things that associated with me in getting that degree. So doing design is never as simple as a business degree. You always have to get art materials. You have to think about printing the projects and all of these things.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
As much as the government was providing free tuition, I still had to think about how do I present a project to look professional. All these printing costs and all of these other things that you don&#8217;t necessarily think about before. So I had to keep my job. And I realized that within RBC, there is a internal graphic designer.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So when I was there as an office assistant, I looked through the company directory and I called the graphic designer at the time. I was like, hi, I want to do graphic design. I want to know what qualifications do you have? How did you get the job? And the person, she was really sweet. And she told me the school that she went to, and it was actually the same school that I was in at the time.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And she would help me with my assignments and helped me just to get the portfolio that I needed to become a graphic designer. And when she left, she told me, &#8220;Cherry, apply for the job.&#8221; I did not get a job the first time, but one year later, the person who replaced her left. And at that time, I was able to get work experience in graphic design.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So within the year of that person holding my spot as a graphic designer of RBC, I was able to teach graphic design with a government program at the time, which was retraining adults who wanted to learn a skill. So after not getting a job and feeling really disappointed, I was able to find something that gave me the experience. So the next time the job came up, I was able to apply again and get the job. So it works out in the end.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. I mean, first of all, shout out to that woman for helping you out and letting you know this was an opportunity that you could take and also kind of motivating you to get to that point.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Yes. She really did, and she&#8217;s still a friend till today. She messaged me this week.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the best thing about the work that you do now?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
The best thing about the work that I do is that nobody tells me what I could do. So I initiate all my projects myself. It&#8217;s something that I never think that I could do because I have a knack for executing other people ideas really, really well. So you give me a vision. You tell me what you want to do. I sit down, I plan with you and we get this done. But when it comes to doing it for myself, there&#8217;s so much fear.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
There&#8217;s so much apprehension. But over the last year, 2020 has taught me if you are afraid, that just means you&#8217;re heading in the right direction, and your better mush the gas under the brakes. So just keep going full steam ahead, and that really helps me to think about how to approach these projects.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So a lot of the projects that I&#8217;m doing right now is around things that I&#8217;ve always loved. So I&#8217;ve always loved history, I&#8217;ve always loved music, I&#8217;ve always loved Trinidad. And a lot of my projects revolve around these things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you found while you&#8217;ve been there in Switzerland, and I know places have been locked down, but have you found some, I don&#8217;t know, sense of community or some kind of sense of home there yet?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Yes and no. So for me, it was difficult to make friends because as any person who is moving to German speaking Europe will tell you if you don&#8217;t speak German, that&#8217;s the first strike against you. And I don&#8217;t speak German. And it was difficult for me to even have conversations with persons because most people can&#8217;t get past my accent even when I speak in my most standard English, as they would want to put it.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
People just so enamored by, &#8220;Oh my God, your accent is so beautiful.&#8221; But I&#8217;m asking for directions to go to the grocery. I need you to tell me where I&#8217;m going. And for me, finding a community actually happened while I was in school. So for us, there was a break in the lockdowns during the summer period, and I was just so happy to get out of my, it was not even a flat, my room and my dorm and the students who were also coming during the summer to do some work.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So I found a community with my friend, [inaudible 00:43:24]. She was from Israel, my friend, Paulina, and she&#8217;s from Poland, Swati, who&#8217;s from India, Pahlavi, who&#8217;s also from India. And I have two German friends as well. For us, it&#8217;s a community of immigrants, but we usually find a lot of common ground that we could all talk about, which is usually food and spices.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So I was able to form a community in my school during the time when nobody should be in school, which is the summer period. And we were all there just trying to catch up on what we think we would have lost during the lockdown.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s so interesting you mentioned that about food kind of being this sort of connective thing between you and other immigrants there. I just finished watching this documentary series on Netflix called High on the Hog. I think it just came out today, as the day we&#8217;re recording it, and I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s available everywhere on Netflix. It may just be U.S. Netflix, not sure, but look it up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So High on the Hog. It&#8217;s a four-part documentary series and the host goes from Benin, West Africa to Charleston, South Carolina, to&#8230; where else does he go? I know he goes to Texas. I feel like he goes somewhere. Oh, he goes to Philadelphia, and then he goes to Texas. And it&#8217;s sort of tracking how so much food, and vegetables, and recipes, and tastes, and spices that were there in Africa made the voyage over and became the basis of soul food here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I think sort of the connective tissue of that documentary and what you&#8217;re talking about is one, how food can be this sort of unifying factor, and how it seems like when food is on the table, and this is probably true in any culture, where foods on the table, we&#8217;re a lot more similar than we are different.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Very much so. I could attest to that. One of my friends, she&#8217;s actually doing her master&#8217;s on the intimacy of food. And just in having discussions with her, I understand all of the walls and the barriers that we think are there with food in front of us, it&#8217;s not anymore. And you are able to communicate and share experiences a lot easier just by sharing that intimate moments of eating in front of somebody or even eating with them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I want to say, I don&#8217;t mean to embarrass you by putting this out here, but speaking of food, as I was doing my research, I saw that you are doing cooking videos on YouTube, which made me so hungry watching them. But please talk about that.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Oh my God. So during the lockdown, I was craving doubles, which is the quintessential Trinidadian breakfast. Any Trinidadian will tell you that doubles, right doubles will make you feel that you&#8217;re a Trinidadian. And you can&#8217;t ask a Trinidadian who has the best doubles, because they will always give you a different answer. But for me, doubles has grown up with me.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
I remember when doubles was $1 and then moved to $1.50. When it went up to $1.50, I stopped buying doubles for a month. And then it went up to $2, and I was like, it is only going to go up from here. Doubles is the cheapest thing that you could get for breakfast, but it also satisfies you after that.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
After you party all night and you&#8217;re sweaty and you&#8217;re still drunk, you will find a doubles vendor to give you that hot [inaudible 00:47:05], and it will remind you of everything that is good in the world. And that was the feeling that I wanted, to relive when I started my cooking journey on YouTube. I am still very shy in doing videos, but I&#8217;m getting there, and I am working on it.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
I brought my cookbook with me from Trinidad, which is naparima cookbook. I think it&#8217;s the book that all Trinidadians learn to cook from. And I am going through that book as though is it&#8230; I think there&#8217;s a movie called Marie &#038; Marie, where she&#8217;s cooking through&#8230; Is it Marie? No. Julie &#038; Julia, where she&#8217;s cooking through all of the recipes of a Julia child&#8217;s cookbook.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh yeah. Amy Adams and Meryl Streep, I think. I know what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And I will definitely be doing that. And I want to bring more recipes to YouTube using Swiss ingredients because I honestly thought I would not find anything that would taste like home in a restaurant, and I haven&#8217;t. So this is why I&#8217;m cooking online. And for me, it&#8217;s also a sense of bridging that gap where people think, especially in Switzerland, that a stranger is somebody who you have to be afraid of.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
But once I share food with you, you can&#8217;t be afraid of me anymore. This is me showing you my culture, showing you my side of life. And it involves a lot of flavor and all of&#8230; It involves sustainability in ways in which you may not have considered. So we use all of the food. We use all of the vegetable. We use as much parts of it as possible throughout the cooking. And I want to bring that to the university.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. That sustainability part, you mentioned, that&#8217;s also something in that documentary that I talked about that I thought was really interesting. So there&#8217;s this thing, and I think maybe this exists in other countries, but certainly here in the United States because of slavery and such there&#8217;s this notion that goes around that slaves were kind of given the bad cuts of meat or the unpalatable cuts of meat. And we learned how to cook it, use those and in varied ways like pig&#8217;s feet or pig ear or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Pig&#8217;s tail, chicken feet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But this documentary showed that we&#8217;ve always been like that&#8217;s not necessarily something that came about because of slavery in America. That&#8217;s something that Africans have been doing because when they hunt and they get the animal, they use the entire animal.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Yes. And a lot of indigenous cultures have used these things for centuries. And it&#8217;s only because this new tomb has been coined sustainability that people are now looking at how could we use as much of the products that we have as possible? Hey, hello, we&#8217;ve been doing this. You are new to the game. Let us show you how to do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I first heard about doubles actually because of this show. Back in 2015, I interviewed, I think she might&#8217;ve been the first Trinidadian person I had on the show. Her name was Jeunanne Alkins as she has a animation company and a design company called Everything Slight Pepper.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Oh, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And she was mentioning the name of it came from that&#8217;s her doubles order.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Yes. Every Trini you must have slight pepper. If you don&#8217;t have slight pepper, I&#8217;m not sure if you have a Trinidadian passport. If you have a little sweet sauce too, you have a Trinidad and Tobago passwords we would say for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I have to say your videos on YouTube, the food looks amazing. The stew chicken, the macaroni pie, keep it up.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It looks so good.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
It was all done with my iPhone.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look, that&#8217;s what a lot of people are using. I mean, come on. I just got a new phone last month or so because I&#8217;ve been holding onto my old phone. And this thing has three cameras on the back. These phones are getting so sophisticated. Use the phone. That&#8217;s where all the good cameras are</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
For me I actually had a DSLR. And when I was leaving Trinidad, I realized this is too much for me to carry. I sold my DSLR and the money that I got from it, I put it towards buying the iPhone 11 because I know in the next two to three years, I&#8217;ll be a student and I&#8217;m not making any money to buy any new phone.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So I wanted the letters and I wanted to make sure that if I do anything with regards to recording or videos of photography, at least I have something that could provide me with good quality. And I am honestly excited to share more cooking videos. And those videos were released as part of my first curatorial project.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
It&#8217;s called We Cooking and it was part of a performance festival in Zurich called Zurich Moves and which I curated my thing as 12 other Caribbean designers to present work into a publication, but it tends on a mystery of Zurich Moves. Four curators came together and we produced a publication that is going viral. It&#8217;s getting lots of buzz in the arts within Zurich. And my mind is blown. This was the first time I&#8217;ve ever done anything like this and I want to do so much more of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, if you don&#8217;t mind, I would love to link to your YouTube channel in the video so the audience can check them out as well. They&#8217;re really good.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Definitely. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you feel creatively satisfied?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Right now? Yes, I do. I actually had this conversation a few weeks ago with one of my friends who still works in the bank. And she said to me, Cherry, if you did not leave the bank at the time that you left, I&#8217;m not sure you would have been able to survive because, for me, moving to Switzerland was a three-year project in which it involved at least 10 other people.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So 10 of my friends were there just cheering me on and making sure that I made my savings goals and helping me think about ways in order to make additional money to pay for my bills to move to Switzerland. However, it was called vision 2020 and it was not my goal to move to Switzerland. My goal was to move to Germany to go to design school there. When I got rejected, I had to change plans. I had to pivot really quickly.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And the friend who dropped me when I came to Switzerland, he actually came to Trinidad and he was like, &#8220;Cherry, this is a really nice school. I think you should come.&#8221; And he brought me brochures and I was like, &#8220;Hey, if Switzerland accept me, I&#8217;ll come.&#8221; And I applied and they did.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So that&#8217;s how I got here and this is how a lot of my creativity I could see the value in it now because it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m doing and I&#8217;m doing from my heart and I&#8217;m doing the projects that I really feel passionate about. And I really want people to take notice of how passion could collide with purpose and provide inspiration for you to do things and go places that you may not have necessarily thought was within your reach before.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? It&#8217;s 2026. You&#8217;re out of school by this time. What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
I want to be a writer and a lecturer. So the reason that I did my masters was to become a lecturer at the University of Trinidad and Tobago, which is one of the universities that I attended. But I am thinking now that with Zoom and Skype and the accessibility that we have for online learning, I don&#8217;t need to limit myself so geography.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And I would to continue writing, design politics, and design thinking, and design critique pieces because there&#8217;s so many people and it will just react to everything the same things about design. And not looking at the nitty-gritty and the people who are being left out of the design conversations.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
And I want to say, hello, we&#8217;re here. Take a look at these with my writing. But I also want to help the next generation of designers see that anything is possible and that they could bring their authentic selves into what they are designing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
So online I am at sliceofcherrypye. So it&#8217;s pie with a Y. So it&#8217;s sliceofcherryP-Y-E.site. And I&#8217;m also on Instagram with the same names, sliceofcherrypye, Twitter, TikTok as well where I just make fun out of things on TikTok. Those are the places.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Cherry-Ann Davis, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you really for sharing your honest look at how your life has been coming from another country and being in Switzerland during this whole lockdown and everything, but also really I can tell you have a lot of deep thoughts behind the work that you do about just kind of these intersections of culture and design and history.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I&#8217;m excited to see the work that you produce whether it&#8217;s through the Futuress or through your studies. I&#8217;m excited to see how you bring your culture and all this work that you&#8217;re doing into this world that perhaps in Switzerland is not ready for it, but I have a feeling that you&#8217;re going to make them ready for it whether want to be or not. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Cherry-Ann Davis:</b><br>
Thank you very much, Maurice. I just want to say one thing. My project is called Waiting Self and it&#8217;s exploration of what design could look like if culture is infused into it. So if I didn&#8217;t mention that before.</p>

<p>One of the benefits of hosting this podcast for the past eight years is that I get to see how guests progress in their career. Such is the case with this week&#8217;s guest, Adekunle Oduye! He was one of our first podcast guests way back in 2014, and I recently asked him to come back on the podcast and give everyone an update!</p>
<p>We talked a bit about his current role at Mailchimp, and he went into the importance of design systems in his work. Adekunle also spoke on how his career has shifted over the years, the power of mentorship, and we revisit his 2014 interview to see if his motivations and goals are still on track with where he is now. It&#8217;s rare that we get a chance to do this type of self-reflection, but it&#8217;s definitely clear that Adekunle has grown and evolved by defining his career on his own terms!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Hello. My name is Adekunle Oduye. I am a UX engineer based out of Brooklyn, New York. Currently right now I am working at MailChimp building design systems.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Although I heard that MailChimp had expanded out into New York. How long ago you&#8217;ve been there?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been there, it&#8217;s going to be two years. So they actually have a Brooklyn office. It&#8217;s smaller than the one in Atlanta, but it&#8217;s a pretty good amount of people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Did you get a chance to come to the office?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah. I went to Ponce City Market, which I think, I compare it to Chelsea Markets for people that are from New York. But yeah, it&#8217;s pretty cool. The people are pretty good. The food is pretty amazing. I, I think every time I left, I felt full and also wanting to come back.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I love that office space that they have in Ponce City Market, although I think the last I heard, they were about to move out of it because the company&#8217;s gotten bigger. So they&#8217;re moving to a different space, I think in another part of town.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s correct. I&#8217;m not too familiar, but from what I&#8217;ve heard from the people that are down there, it seems like they have to walk down the BeltLine. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s 10 minutes or whatever, but yeah, they&#8217;re going to be moving. I don&#8217;t know when it&#8217;s going to happen, but it&#8217;s probably in the near features.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How&#8217;s your year been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah. My year has been pretty good. I&#8217;ve been taking the easy since last year. I think last year was hectic for everyone. But I think for me, what I was trying to do is stay busy. So I was doing a bunch of stuff, side projects, and doing some freelancing, and reading a lot, and whatnot. So, this year is just like, I&#8217;m just taking it easy and establishing some of my hobbies that I haven&#8217;t been doing in a while, so it&#8217;s been pretty good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One thing I remember from our last interview is that you&#8217;re a painter. Did you take that up last year?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
I did one painting, but I did drawing because it&#8217;s &#8230; I think with me the painting, I feel like I&#8217;ve lost a lot of my skills because I feel like a lot of my work recently is mostly on the computer. So I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of drawing. In 2019, I did a couple of drawing classes. So I went to the museum and was drawing. Also, we had critique sessions. Yeah, I&#8217;m trying to do baby steps where I try to draw something every day and get back into it. But hopefully this summer, I&#8217;m going to have dedicated time where I just get lost in that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Nice. What else did you learn about yourself over the past year? I feel like everyone is starting to come out of this with some new personal revelation about themselves.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah. I think for me, there was a lot going on last year, and I was like, it was making me very anxious and worrisome. I got into a lot of stoicism. For those who don&#8217;t know, stoicism is basically ancient philosophy, and it gives you a way of living. I think one of the most common things they have talked about is that how you want to focus on things you can control. I think that was helpful because I think not only in life, but at work, there&#8217;s some stuff that bothers you whatnot, but you have to really focus on, what can you control? If you can&#8217;t control it, then you shouldn&#8217;t really worry about it, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, that makes a lot of sense. I think it&#8217;s a really helpful tactic in general. Certainly it&#8217;s actually a piece of advice I&#8217;ve given a lot of people this year that have started working remotely is to focus on the stuff that you can control. Because you&#8217;re thrust back home and it&#8217;s not exactly the work environment and you have to adjust to that, just focus on the things you can control. You can control how you respond to things. You can control your reactions, things of that nature.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. I think that actually helped me with a lot of being more proactive rather than reactive because a lot of the stuff is like, if something happens or let&#8217;s say someone says something to you, you can&#8217;t really control that, but you can control how you response to it or how you&#8217;re going to move forward. I think that&#8217;s been my response and my mentality since last year. I think it has been very helpful because things always happen, especially with work where sometimes you can go through reorg, and people are not seeing eye to eye, but I think always look back and say, all right, what can I do better? What can I do to help people? I think that&#8217;s been very helpful, but also it keeps me grounded.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Speaking of work, what does a regular day look like for you at MailChimp?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
A lot of it revolves around maintaining current designed system that&#8217;s being used in the product. So, some days I could be responding to people that have questions around like the design system, other days I could be building components. Currently right now, I&#8217;m mostly focusing on prototyping. So prototyping patterns, and seeing how we can establish these pre-built guidelines and patterns that designers and engineers can use when they&#8217;re building out features.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I want to talk a little bit about design systems. I feel like that&#8217;s something that personally, I&#8217;ve really only heard fairly recently. Can you talk about what a design system is, and how it&#8217;s different from say, a style guide or a brand guide or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah, for sure. A design system is basically a collection of components, patterns, and guidelines for a product. So, any product you see from Facebook to Google or whatever like that, they have a specific set of design systems. The whole idea is that you create these peed built Lego blocks for UI so that people can take certain pieces and start building the whole user experience or application of natural product. The difference between design system and style guy is that I would say the design system is the umbrella, and it includes the style guy and the style guy would define the more atomic levels of the design systems. So, your type holography, how your buttons are going to look, where are the colors, and whatnot. Basically from those foundation styles you go build to your components, or you build your patterns and whatnot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now is a design system important when it comes to a product like MailChimp?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s important because as your product grows, there&#8217;s supposed to be a lot of tech debt, but also in some cases, there might not be a cohesive UI experience overall. So the whole idea of design system is to making sure that the product is scalable, it&#8217;s accessible, and is performing. One case scenario would be like if I am a product engineer and I want to build a feature, rather than building it from scratch, they could use a design system that will help them build the actual user flow much quickly and faster.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. So it&#8217;s almost like a, I was going to say like a kit or a tool box or something. It makes the development a lot easier because you&#8217;re pulling from all these pre-designed elements that you can slot into place, or use to quickly prototype or make something.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah, pretty much. It&#8217;s not only specific to engineers, but it could be useful for designers. There&#8217;s even more in the case where they do for contractors. There are many ways you could use the actual design system. I think the best design systems are the ones that are inclusive and are be able to use by many different people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Even for content strategists, that would be &#8230; I guess I could see that, if there certain tone or certain passages, like error messages or something like that, like microcopy, that kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah, pretty much. We actually have one content style guide that we have, and I think it&#8217;s super important because I look at it as like, people are not visiting your product because of the UI, they&#8217;re visiting because of the content, and whatnot. So, having a consistent way of doing content is super important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Gotcha. Gotcha. I was curious about that because at the startup that I&#8217;m currently at, they&#8217;re focusing pretty heavily on design systems, but we don&#8217;t have a brand guide, or a style guide. There are certain types of things that they want to do branching out with content and other media and stuff, but we don&#8217;t have that sort of structure in place to make sure that the things we&#8217;re creating are cohesive to the rest of the brand or something. I&#8217;m glad that you mentioned that, it&#8217;s sort of an umbrella for these other things because I know when I&#8217;ve tried to explain it, they look at me like I&#8217;ve got an arm growing out of my forehead or something. So, I feel like I know I&#8217;m on the right track here, is not the same thing, but it&#8217;s similar. Okay, gotcha.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah. I would also add that, I always compare it to building a house, you don&#8217;t want to start making your own screws and all this other stuff. So, usually you have some case where you&#8217;re like, all right, we have all these different pieces, and you can put them together to fit or solve any problem that you want to face. It just makes your life easier. You don&#8217;t have to focus on two things at once.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I remember when we first talked on Revision Path, which for those listening was seven years ago, Adekunle was episode 21. At that time, you were just about to start at NASDAQ. I think it was maybe the day before your first day or something like that. Do you remember what your time was like there?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah. It was definitely an interesting experience. I would say that was probably my first real corporate job, so I didn&#8217;t know what to expect. I can say I definitely learned a lot. I encountered with a lot of great people and different people. I think it&#8217;s something that I use to this day because I was part of a large product design team is one of 30 of us. I&#8217;ve learned a lot. I learned a lot about front end development. I learned a lot about research. I learned about how to talk to executives. So, it was definitely a good experience there. I think I was there for three and a half years, which is the longest-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
&#8230; time I spent with one employer. So, it was a fulfilling experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
After that, you were at Justworks for a minute. Actually we just had someone on the show, Sabrina Hall, well, she&#8217;s at Justworks now. But you were at Justworks for a minute. And then after that you were at Sloan Kettering. When you think back on those two experiences, what do you remember?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah. I think those two experience was probably how I learned what I wanted to do. When I was at Justworks, I was really figuring out what I want to do because it was like, I think a lot of times like, company want to put you in a box. I remember when I was doing an interview, they were like, &#8220;Are you more of a designer or developer?&#8221; I was like, I wanted to get the job, so I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m a designer,&#8221; but I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m doing both.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s where I really learned what I wanted to do because I think even when I was there, I was probably one of the more technical product designers. It was hard to do both when you&#8217;re working on three different squads, so it was a good learning lesson.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
I think what I&#8217;ve taken away from there was that I want to be in a place where I was able to use both my design and development skills. Another was I really wanted to focus more on design systems. And then at Sloan Kettering, that was probably the second time I was more of a lead for a project. So I was leading the design system efforts there, which I really enjoyed starting from the ground up. I did a lot of user interviews, and was able to work with people and build it from the ground up and creating that foundation. Yeah, it was definitely hard work because people that I&#8217;ve worked in design centers tend to know there&#8217;s so many things you have to do. There was just me by myself working on it and getting some part-time help from some of the engineers. So I realized when I was there, it was understanding that you have to have a team to build something great because it&#8217;s so much work has to go into it.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Another was around alignment because I think when I was there, I was working on design systems, but there was other departments that are working on design systems. I think it was harder because I don&#8217;t think we were aligned on what the design system should be. So, that was one of the takeaways I learned where it&#8217;s like making sure you&#8217;re aligned, and making sure that your design system is inclusive, and people can see it, use it, and also provide some feedback was super important. Yeah, I think those experience definitely shaped me and understand what I wanted to do and how I wanted to do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It looks like your career focus has really shifted over time. You started out back when you were about to start at NASDAQ, you started out with front-end. From there as you went to other places, you shifted to UX, then to product. Now you&#8217;re, at least what it sounds like from the work of doing a MailChimp, back to front-end. Talk to me about that. What caused those shifts as you progressed in your career?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah. I think it&#8217;s more a case of what I&#8217;m curious on. I think one of the things I promised myself when I was starting out was that I wanted to take any idea from start to finish. So, that means from the design standpoint, I want to be able to do the research and understand who our users are, also understand the business, and what would be beneficial to the business. How do they make money? And then from the UI standpoint, it was to really understand what makes good product UI, and how we can make it cohesive, and whatnot. And then midway through my career, I learned that, all right, you could design the best mock up, but if you can&#8217;t build it or if it&#8217;s hard to build, then it&#8217;s probably not going to look exactly like it would look when you&#8217;re designing it. So that&#8217;s where I started really understanding the technical side, even how the internet works and how the browser works, and what is possible, and how to make performance applications and websites.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
I would say it was a curious from the start to the end of building something out. I enjoy it. I think often times, you look at the stuff I&#8217;ve done, even you look at the actual job titles I had in the past, which stand from print designer, web designer, front-end developer, product designer, design technologist, UX engineer, front engineer. It&#8217;s a lot, but I feel like for me, it&#8217;s I&#8217;m curious in learning how to build products from start to finish. I think over each of those job titles, I&#8217;ve learned so much, and it&#8217;s helped me to really understand what I want to do and how I want to do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, back also when we did your first interview, I remember you told me a piece of career advice that you give to other designers. You said to always study your craft, do you still stand by that?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah, for sure. I think it&#8217;s something that never ends. I double down to the case where you have to study the basics before you start to do anything that&#8217;s more complex. It reminds me of when I was in an art school, where I was like, I want to do a painting. But I think one of my teachers was like, &#8220;You have to learn how to draw first because that&#8217;s the foundation.&#8221; I think it&#8217;s the same with design and engineering, whereas with design, you have to really understand typography, color theory, spacing, line, and et cetera. With engineering, it&#8217;s more in the case of understanding design patterns, and variables, and functions, and whatnot. If you understand that core, then you pretty much could do anything. It&#8217;s similar case of programming. You understand one programming language, you could probably program anything else, you just have to figure out the syntax. I think that&#8217;s what I always communicate to people often.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there any other advice that you would add to that just based off your experience over the past seven years?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah, for sure. I think one thing I mentioned before is, don&#8217;t allow people to put you in a box. Oftentimes, I hear people go like, you&#8217;re just a designer, so you only should focus on design, or you&#8217;re a developer, you only should focus on developer. But I think the people that are going to stand out and be great teammates are the ones that have experience in multiple disciplines. I&#8217;ve seen people, like designers that are very good with writing copy, and I think that&#8217;s a skill that I wish I had, but it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s great to have when you&#8217;re being part of a team. I think it just helps with overall personal growth and always pushing yourself to do something different because I think oftentimes, you can get very comfortable with, I been doing design for 20 years, I&#8217;m just going to keep on doing it.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
I feel my design career has helped me become a better developer, and I would say vice versa too. Yeah, I would say don&#8217;t let people put in a box and always explore different disciplines and whatnot. The second thing I would add would be to making sure that people are very proactive with how they want their career to go because I think oftentimes, people think about, I&#8217;m at this job and I&#8217;m only doing this, and I&#8217;m going to do this. But I think how I envisioned it was, I want to be able to do this and this. This was when I first started out. I wanted to always make sure that my current job or role is pushing me forward to that actual goal I had. I think going in that way, maybe right where the focus on like, all right, what I&#8217;m doing today is this helpful. If it&#8217;s not pushing you forward, then I had to talk to my manager, or I figure out, what were some ways I could build on those skills and whatnot? So, I would say those are the two additions I had.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I want to go into mentoring. I noticed from looking at your LinkedIn that you&#8217;ve been working with this organization called Springboard as a UX mentor. You&#8217;ve been doing that for almost three years now. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Springboard is basically a bootcamp that&#8217;s run online where anyone that is interested in becoming a product designer, and I think they expand it to software engineering, but I work on the UX side of things, but anyone can take this course. It&#8217;s about say six to eight months long. You basically are learning a lot about the foundations of UX and UI, and you get paired with a mentor. So, each week you talk with your mentor about the stuff you&#8217;ve done, and if you have any questions or whatnot. Yeah, I&#8217;ve been doing it for three years and I probably had 10 plus mentees. One of my ways of teaching them is always using experiences from my past, which I feel like that&#8217;s a better way of telling a story rather than just saying like, you need to do this because X, Y, and Z. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
I would say it helped me to really get good at explaining my process because usually the mentees were always ask like, &#8220;Why should I do this over that?&#8221; Probably four or five years ago, I&#8217;d have been like, &#8220;Well, because that&#8217;s how I learned it.&#8221; But now I&#8217;m better at explaining why should you use one technique over the other and what makes good design. Also, I think be able to critique is a skill that I needed to improve on. Yeah, it&#8217;s been overall a good experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s so interesting hearing you talk about mentoring and then just juxtaposing that with our interview from so long ago on how you were just starting out. It&#8217;s great to hear your growth in that area. What do you really gain from being a mentor? What does it give you?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
I would say that the first thing is just giving back, paying it forward because even what you said is, from when I was seven years ago, I was pretty much into anything, I was more a designer, and I wanted to get into product and whatnot. The reason how I got to this point was like, I had a lot of people that allowed me to ask questions, and allow me to pick their brain in order for me to get better. So my idea would be to paint that forward. So I think that would be the first thing. The second thing as I mentioned is that, it&#8217;s more in the case of learning how to communicate and talk about your process. I realized that as you spend more time in this industry, you&#8217;re going to work with a lot of designers, technical folks, non-technical folks.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
I think one of the key things is to be able to communicate your ideas and thoughts to multiple people. I think mentorship is definitely one of them because I definitely had specific cases where people ask me questions about color theory, or design systems, or whatnot, and I always had to make sure that I was able to explain in a way where they could understand. Yeah, I think overall, it&#8217;s been pretty good. I feel like it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m able to empower people, and hopefully they can accomplish their goals and dreams and whatnot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I keep referencing our interview just because I&#8217;m struck as you talk just how different things have changed just, even hearing in how you carry yourself has changed. You mentioned back then you really wanted to speak at conferences, which you&#8217;ve done since then. What are some of the events that you&#8217;ve spoken at?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
From our conversation, the year after that was my first conference talk, which was CSS Conference, which was probably one of the most terrifying, but best things I&#8217;ve done. The reason why I say that is because I did my talk and I re-wrote my talk the night before because I was so nervous and whatnot. But I think, again, that was like, I probably would never do that again, but it&#8217;s a learning lesson and whatnot. But yeah, it&#8217;s been pretty good. I&#8217;ve been able to speak at some of the conference that I always wanted to go to. So, some of them has been clarity. I did an event part, did smashing magazine, and went to a smashing meets and whatnot. I&#8217;m around at 30 40, which is wild.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
I think last year I spoke at the most conferences I&#8217;d done ever because I think everything was remote, so it was pretty good stuff. But yeah, it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m glad I did because I think, even back then when I was looking at it, I was very fearful of public speaking. I think usually a lot of people are scared of public speaking. For me, I decided to, I got to face this fear head on. So the best way to do was to get up on stage and talk about something. But yeah, it&#8217;s been a great experience. I&#8217;ve met so many great people along the way that&#8217;s helped me become a better speaker, better developer, better designer, overall good person. But yeah, I hope to continue doing that in the future. I don&#8217;t know when in-person is going to come back, but it&#8217;s going to come back probably next year or something like that. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It feels like some places are even trying to bring stuff back this year. Maybe they&#8217;re waiting until the fall and the winter. I know I&#8217;ve gotten some invites to actually San Francisco Design Week. As we&#8217;re recording the San Francisco Design Week, I got invited for that. They were like, you can come in-person if you want. I&#8217;m like, that&#8217;s next month. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to be there for that, but I appreciate the invite. They&#8217;ll allow it virtually. To your point about so many events going virtual last year, I spoke a ton last year for that same reason. I could just log on here at the house and be on a panel or give a talk or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I wonder if that&#8217;s going to really continue as we move forward because I went to a lot of new events that honestly just took advantage of the current situation to be able to put an event on, doing it online means you don&#8217;t have to worry about a venue, or insurance costs, or things of that nature. You can just set up a series of Zoom calls or whatever. I hope that continues in the future because I think that&#8217;s made these types of conferences a lot more accessible for more people.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah, for sure. I think that was one thing I&#8217;ve learned when I was attending [inaudible 00:28:51] last year. They had a thing where we were doing networking, speed, dating sort of. I remember I was talking to a bunch of people. Some people were from Russia, they were like, yeah, I was always wanted to go to one, but I can never go because I couldn&#8217;t afford it. So, I agree that it &#8230; I think hopefully they have some hybrid where they can do both. But I like it. I feel like I spoke to more people in virtual conferences, or network with more people in virtual conferences than real life because-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Really?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
&#8230; it actually forced me to speak to new people, which is interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s interesting. I don&#8217;t know what the first in-person conference is going to be that I attend. If they have it in-person this year, I may go to Black in Design in Boston. Well, actually it&#8217;s a Cambridge, but close enough in Boston. I may go to that, if they do it in-person this year. I&#8217;ve missed that kind of in-person camaraderie. I don&#8217;t know, we are able to network with people after talks. You could talk to people in the hall and stuff like that. I&#8217;ve missed those kinds of spontaneous connections because I did a bunch of talks last year, and the one thing was, once my talk was over, that was it. I closed the laptop and I&#8217;m like, okay, now what? Wait for the honorarium to come in and print, which is not bad, but that sort of in-person networking thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s still going to take a while, but I&#8217;ve started already seeing some events. Actually funny enough last year, our design live, I think was going to have an event here in Atlanta. They were asking me about, not about speaking, I think they wanted me to help out as a media partner or something. I was like, it is very irresponsible for you to have an in-person conference in Atlanta in the middle of a pandemic. They ended up doing it online. I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re going to come back down here or not, but we&#8217;ll see. I just hope that more of these virtual events stick around, and that some of these events that had to go virtual at least offer that up as an option moving forward because I got to go to so many things that I otherwise would not have been able to go to. But because it was online, I could just pay my money, get a ticket, log on, boom, boom, boom. It was pretty easy.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah, I agree. I think speaking wise, I think I was doing, at one point, it was three weeks. In a month, I was having three talks. Most, it was same talk. But I would never have done that if it was after traveling, whatnot. So I think it made it easy for me to do those talks and also improve on them because usually what I do is each time I do the talk, I&#8217;ve changed a specific thing and figure out what works and what doesn&#8217;t work. I get feedback from the actual conference. Yeah, I think it was pretty good. I would like to do more in the future. I also be about the actual in-person ones because I think some of the best memories is talking with people, and just chatting, and grabbing dinner, and just meeting new people, and whatnot.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
But yeah, I think hopefully we go back to something that&#8217;s more like, you have hybrid model where some conferences are virtual and other conferences are more of hybrid model. So I think hopefully &#8230; But yeah, I&#8217;m excited for that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. One thing that I usually will ask guests on the show is where they see themselves in five years. I&#8217;m curious, when you think back to when we did our interview, when you think back to that, what did you think you were going to be doing in five years?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Wow. I think when I was looking back, I think I actually wanted to be some of sort of director, or product design director, or whatnot and just leading a team and whatnot. But yeah, that&#8217;s definitely not going to happen. I think things I learned that it was like, I think at one job &#8230; Yeah. I think when I was at NASDAQ, I was managing a person, and also doing icy work. I think managing is important role, but it&#8217;s probably not right for me because it&#8217;s &#8230; I like the craft of it. I think you also feel like, not manage, but I like leading. I think there&#8217;s a difference between those two. You can be a leader and not be a manager, which I was like, okay, I could do that. Even in the more technical fields, you have some ICS that are more managers, you have ICS that are more of directors and directing projects and what not. So I think it allows for more flexibility and whatnot. You said five years, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
I mean, I wouldn&#8217;t even know because if you told me seven years ago I&#8217;ll be where I am today, I&#8217;d be like, you&#8217;re lying. Yeah, I think my goal is to definitely do more mentorship. I would like to have some mentorship program. It&#8217;s for people that would like to get into more of the design engineering, which is both basically a designer engineer, in that roam because I know there&#8217;s not a lot of resources around that. You have to be a designer or the engineer. So I&#8217;m trying to create this community that&#8217;s more of a case of these hybrid thinkers and whatnot. I think doing more teaching, mentorship, and whatnot, I think that would be my goal.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
But yeah, that&#8217;s hard because like I said, back in the day, I had a whole list, and even prior to that, I wanted to be an art director for a magazine publishing company, and things have changed a lot. So, I try not to make too much of a long-term goal, but hopefully I&#8217;m doing more teaching and mentorship.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I like that the idea of doing a design engineer hybrid community because I think we&#8217;re starting to see, at least I know, I&#8217;m starting to see a lot more of that in tech. The place where I&#8217;m at currently, for example, is largely, I think it&#8217;s mostly engineers. But a lot of the engineers are operating in a hybrid sort of thing. So they&#8217;re an engineer, but they&#8217;re also on our growth team, or they&#8217;re an engineer and they might also be doing maybe something more like DevOps or infrastructure. That&#8217;s not so much front-end type stuff. I think that&#8217;s something that you&#8217;re starting to see more of this melding of skills, particularly with startups that try to stay small and lean. They usually want to have a bunch of hybrids that can do multiple roles as opposed to a particular specialist that can come in and only does one thing, and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah. I think you&#8217;re right. It&#8217;s becoming more of a thing. I think 10 years ago, was the case of we only want you to do one thing, but I think organizations are starting to see the benefits of having these hybrids because they not only could do two things, but they could also collaborate with different people, and also take ideas from concept to completion in a timely fashion. So, it&#8217;s definitely going to be more in the future. Again, there&#8217;s not many resources dedicated for these individuals because I think how we communicate is like, you have to pick one over the other. I always though, it was like, you don&#8217;t have to pick one or the other, you could do both.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve been doing it for 10 years. Even if they hire me for one thing, I always end up doing the other thing. So, it&#8217;s definitely going to take off and hopefully it becomes a thing where people, not only in career, but also in school are like, I could become a design engineer and whatnot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you spend time on when you&#8217;re not working?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time, either drawing and picking random hobbies. So actually for some reason, I bought a lock picking set and I enjoy doing that. Again, I&#8217;m not going to do it to rob anyone. Yeah, trying to do more stuff that&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t require a computer. So hopefully in the future, I could do pick up like woodworking and some other things. But yeah, I enjoy more tangible, actual building stuff because I think definitely last year told me where I was like, I need to spend less time on a computer, especially with all the Zoom meetings and whatnot. I used to do when I was younger around art painting and even doing something that was sculptures, but again, I&#8217;m trying to do a baby step, so I&#8217;m going to start with drawing and then hopefully graduate to the more complex ones.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember seeing something, I think it was a study or something, it was talking about the rise in video conferencing and how it&#8217;s increasing carbon emissions overall because of the, I guess the carbon footprint of doing video conferencing versus, say meeting up in-person or something like that, which is honestly something that I didn&#8217;t really think about at all. If anything, I was like, well, if we&#8217;re not traveling, then yes, carbon emissions would go down because you&#8217;re not in planes or trains or automobiles or something like that. But I was reading this study and it was saying that one hour of video conferencing, puts out, I think up to 1,000 grams of carbon dioxide, and it requires up to 12 liters of water. But if you turn your camera off, you reduce that footprint by 90 something percent, which is ridiculous.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s amazing because I think a lot of people think like, I&#8217;m not really increasing my footprint because it&#8217;s all digital, but you have to understand there&#8217;s servers, and those servers require power. So the more you do, the more energy is on use and whatnot. Yeah, I think hopefully you figure out how to decrease that because I think, especially moving forward, there&#8217;s going to be cases where a lot of companies and whatnot are going to be more of a hybrid model and it&#8217;s going to be more video conferencing and whatnot. So hopefully, we figure out ways to optimize it overall.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s an interesting thing because I know I&#8217;ve heard that around like cryptocurrency because I&#8217;ve heard folks talk about how Bitcoin is actually really bad for the environment. When I first heard that, I said, well, how is a digital currency bad for the environment? Then I looked into it in terms of the data processing that&#8217;s used to mine for Bitcoin uses a lot of electricity, and any production of electricity has a carbon footprint, a water footprint, a land footprint. So, all of that can cause environmental damage overall. And then when you look at, how many gigabytes of data are we using between YouTube, and Zoom, and Facebook, and Instagram, and Twitter, and TikTok. Lord knows how many other platforms and stuff. I don&#8217;t know how this veered off into environmentalism, but I just &#8230; I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s something that you&#8217;ve mentioned that had me think about that particular study. So maybe somebody that&#8217;s listening, they can look into that if they want to.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
No, I think it&#8217;s important because I think a lot of people thought, I&#8217;m not really doing much because I&#8217;m at home and I&#8217;m watching videos or doing this, but there&#8217;s always straight offs, and there&#8217;s always some sort of footprint. Even me, I had to learn about this. I was like, that doesn&#8217;t really make sense. But if you think about it, the more technology you use, the more servers we need, and also the more metals we need. So it&#8217;s just, there&#8217;s a compound effect to all this stuff we do. I think it&#8217;s good and more people are aware of it. Hopefully that awareness translates to people creating products that are quicker, faster performance and whatnot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, hopefully so. The next video meeting I have, I&#8217;m going to turn the camera off and tell them I&#8217;m saving the environment. See if that works. I think it&#8217;ll work. I&#8217;m going to try it out.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
You&#8217;re like, I&#8217;m trying to save the planet, so I will keep it off.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you wish you would have been told about this industry when you first started?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
I think the first one had been around burnout because I think earlier in my career, I was like, I&#8217;m going to work all the time. I&#8217;m going to use every framework, every tool, and whatnot. I would say I probably been burnt out a lot of times because I wanted to learn it all and use it all. So I wish someone told me, was like, don&#8217;t focus your time on learning new things, focus your time on building. Let&#8217;s say, if I wanted to learn Python, I would say early in my career, I probably would read a book and go through a bunch of video courses on it. But me now, I would be like, all right, what project am I building? Is Python the right tool for it? Somebody [inaudible 00:42:24] it was like, all these technologies and whatever like that, think of them as building tools, so like a screwdriver, a hammer and whatnot.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
The best way to learn how to use a hammer is that, if you&#8217;re feeling like, say building a house, and you always have to ask the question is like, am I using the right tool? Because if I&#8217;m building a house, then do I need a flame thrower? Again, a flame thrower is probably not a tool, but it&#8217;s one of the tools in your tool sets. You have to figure out which tool is best for the job. I think that would have been super helpful because I definitely burned myself out with learning random things and whatnot.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
The second thing is that, because I think a lot of times people look at the tech industry as, it must have been so great, and all these companies are perfect. I was like, yeah, none of these companies are perfect. All of them have their problems. They&#8217;re basically same as like humans. There&#8217;s no perfect human, is the case of has everyone has their own problems and you have to figure out which company is worth your time and effort because I think a lot of times, I see it where I hear people that are coming to school like, my dream company is working at this company. And then there&#8217;s always some news that comes out about a company and their bad practices and whatnot. So, I would always say there&#8217;s no one great company. Also, don&#8217;t put these companies on a pedestal because I think a lot of times, you say like, you work at Google or Facebook. I think a lot of times, people put those people that work there above everyone else.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
But I wouldn&#8217;t say that&#8217;s the case because I think there&#8217;s a lot of companies that are not as big and are not located in SF or New York that are doing some great work. So I think that&#8217;s the thing I&#8217;ve learned being in this industry for 10 years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think that&#8217;s the truth, there is no such thing as a perfect tech company. They all are culpable in some way. I think we&#8217;ve certainly seen that, Jesus, over the past five years, look at some of the really big tech companies like Facebook and Google and Twitter, and how they&#8217;ve managed to now be wrapped up into our everyday politics, and even the democracy of this country, and everything. Aside from the fact that their tools are being used as these platforms for misinformation, then you look at the hiring practices or the management practices, or &#8230; It&#8217;s so weird.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I guess I could give this as an example, I&#8217;m not under NDA. My last employer, for example, was very woke. It&#8217;s what you would call a woke employer. I will not name this employer, you know the name of the employer, Adekunle, the folks who are listening probably know the name of it. I will not mention the name of it, however, this place really prided itself on being very open and transparent and things of that nature. I can tell you, it could not have been further from the truth behind the scenes. I mean, lying, gaslighting, all sorts of stuff, it was a mess. I mean, it&#8217;s been reported in the news. I don&#8217;t have to name the company, you all know which company I&#8217;m talking about, but it&#8217;s a mess.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, it&#8217;s a like shell of its former self, which is really unfortunate. I want to see the company succeed, but there no perfect tech companies, we&#8217;re all humans at the end of the day.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve heard so many things that I&#8217;ve been part of, especially last year when there was a lot of talk about the black experience in tech and how companies are like, no, we&#8217;re inclusive and whatnot. And then there&#8217;s individual saying, no, because they&#8217;ve done X, Y, and Z and blah, blah, blah. So it&#8217;s always making sure that, again, you don&#8217;t put these companies in pedestals and understand the fact. I would add this to where it&#8217;s safe, making sure that you produce your own content, and have your own side hustle, just in case, because again, I see some messed up things that changed the way I think about working at a company.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
The one scenario I was going to, I&#8217;m going to use, I&#8217;m not going to name the company. But I was working at this company and this person was at, she&#8217;s worked there for 10 years and whatnot, and I remember going through a rotation, they were like, here, we&#8217;re a family. Everyone loves us. We&#8217;re here for you. And then one day they basically fired her on &#8230; They told her on a Wednesday that her last day would be Friday and she was crying. She was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to do and whatnot.&#8221; That was a wake-up call because I was like, I never want to be in that position where a company fires me and I have no game plan after that. Yeah, that would be another advice I&#8217;ll give people is, always have some sort of side hustle.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
I wouldn&#8217;t say having a million of them, but like for me, I do the mentorship, I do conquer speaking, write articles and books and whatnot. So, even if I get fired from my day job, I&#8217;ll be able to survive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Always have a plan B, absolutely. At this point in your career, how do you define success?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
I define success with two things. The first thing would be freedom. The idea of being able to work on what I want to work on, or work the way I want to work and whatnot, and also work with the people I want to work with. The second thing would be around happiness because I think an idea is, you have to be happy. I think there&#8217;s been a change with how people think about success because people sometimes think like, I could have all this money, but if you don&#8217;t have your health and you have no one to share with, then you&#8217;re not going to be happy. So I think I always focus on making sure that I&#8217;m free to do whatever I want to do, and I&#8217;m happy.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll add a third thing where is like, I am pushing myself to best level possible because I always think about, can I be better? Can I do different things and whatnot? The one thing I want to do is I want to have no regrets when I get older because I was scared of whatnot. What I was mentioning before was like, doing speaking engagements, I was terrified. I was like, I&#8217;m tired of feeling scared, let me just face this fear head on. So I would say those three things are probably how I define success.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Given that definition of success, what do you appreciate the most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
The first thing is I&#8217;m healthy. I know we went through a pandemic and current still in one, and I would say health is probably one of the top thing because you&#8217;re able to do so many things, if you have some good health. So, that would be the first thing. I think the second thing is understanding what I want to do out of life, or how I want to do it. I think, as I mentioned before, during the time I was between those two jobs, I really figured out what I want to do, how I want to do it. I think that made it easy because now any other opportunity comes my way, I know if it&#8217;s right for me or not night for me from the moment I hear about it.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
There&#8217;s a lot of people that are older than me, they&#8217;re like, don&#8217;t know what they want to do and whatnot. But I think for me, that&#8217;s been something that helps me push forward. But also I know when to say no and when to say yes to certain things because it has to fall under those criteria. But yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What haven&#8217;t you done yet that you want to do?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
The one thing I wanted to do is hopefully do a startup, start my own startup in the future. I know this is probably a cliche answer from someone that&#8217;s working in tech, but I think that&#8217;s something that I want to just try out and see if I could do it and whatnot, and see if it&#8217;s something feasible but for me. But I think that&#8217;s the thing I probably want to do within the next 10 years. If it works, it works. If it doesn&#8217;t work, it&#8217;d be a learning lesson. But I think overall looking back at what I&#8217;ve learned in the past 10 years, the idea of taking the idea from concept to completion, I was like, well, I think I&#8217;m set up to be a CEO one day, not for a big company, but just do my own thing and providing some sort of product. So, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s going to be tech related or shoot. It might be something that&#8217;s physical, but-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It could be lock picking.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
That&#8217;s my thing. I&#8217;m trying to think of, how can I turn this into a product? But yeah, hopefully something comes along my way that I&#8217;m super passionate about, and I can use my skills. Also, there&#8217;s a group of people that I can provide a service to. Yeah, hopefully-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
That happens.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and your work and everything and follow you online?</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
You can follow me at adekunleoduye.com. My site is really old, but it&#8217;s going to be updated in the next couple of weeks. You&#8217;ll find me in any social media, specifically my first name and last name. So, it shouldn&#8217;t be that hard. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m the only Adekunle Oduye, but I&#8217;m the only one online, so I&#8217;m going to market it. Yeah, just that find me on those channels.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sounds good. Well, Adekunle Oduye, thank you so much for coming back on Revision Path, and for giving us an update. As I said to you before we started recording, I listened back to our first interview, and the change in just how you are talking about your work, how you&#8217;re carrying yourself as a person from that interview to this interview is like night and day. I can really tell that you&#8217;ve grown up and matured in this industry. You&#8217;ve learned some things, and you&#8217;re taking that out into the work that you&#8217;re doing, and out into the world by mentoring other people and really paying it forward. So, it&#8217;s really been a pleasure for me to see your development over these past few years. I&#8217;m glad to see that you&#8217;re mentoring and helping out the next generation while still working in this industry and trying to make a difference. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Adekunle Oduye:</b><br>
Yeah. Thanks again for having me. I am hopeful that anyone that&#8217;s listening to this one and also the past interview I did, motivates them, they&#8217;re like, you don&#8217;t have to be perfect, and anyone can do it. Yeah, I appreciate it. Keep on doing this.</p>

<p>A dear friend of mine asked me to include a creative on Revision Path that could speak to building a personal brand online, and my mind went immediately to UI/UX designer Brandon Groce. I first encountered Brandon a year ago hosting an AIGA DC design event, and was impressed by his work creating content for design brands including Disney, Hilton, and LG. Did I mention he&#8217;s also an Adobe Partner?</p>
<p>Our conversation started off with an update on what Brandon&#8217;s been doing over the past year, and he talked about his current and upcoming projects, including the DesignOff Tournament. We also talked about building confidence, showcasing your work, and&#8230;the metaverse? (You&#8217;ll have to listen to the end to find out!) Kudos to Brandon for being a great designer and for helping elevate the next generation of designers through his events!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Alright, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Howdy-doody, Maurice. My name is Brandon Groce, yes, gross as in nasty, not spelt that way, but I am a designer and Adobe partner, and kind of can be summed up in terms of what I do, not necessarily what I am, but I create content for design brands and I throw on some highly edu-taining design events.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. How&#8217;s the year been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not going to lie, I love being able to be in my house and not have any outdoor obligations, my friend. My partner asked me, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you like to go outside?&#8221; And I looked back to my childhood and I was like, &#8220;I think I was always in a corner with the computer, in two sheets to cover my whereabouts.&#8221; [inaudible 00:03:49] focus either playing games or learning things on the internet. Honestly, my year has been good. I absolutely love learning. It&#8217;s not the same for everybody else. Everybody has a different situation, but I&#8217;ve been very lucky to have healthy family members and be in this situation that I&#8217;m in. So it&#8217;s been good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Good. What lessons did you learn over the past year? How do you think you&#8217;ve grown and improved?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I&#8217;m a very anxious person. My parents are like Brandon, you need to wear that pro, I don&#8217;t even know Prozac is the thing, but I don&#8217;t think stress or anxiety is a negative thing. I really think it is a beautiful thing, or at least in my case, because it tells me it is literally a biological indicator of like that is just going to fuck up your day. So please fix that.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
So this year, I have learned how to effectively &#8230; or it&#8217;s going to get better as I get older, how to learn what I need to quickly to put out a fire or build a raft, or learn whatever I need to, to either avoid or somehow redirect whatever catastrophe is coming my way, specifically when it comes to my business. I&#8217;ve only been in business for two &#8230; I can&#8217;t even say two. Yes, I&#8217;m still saying one. I&#8217;ve had an audience for a while, but it&#8217;s only been, I think, a year, last month, where I&#8217;ve ventured on my own and trying to figure out with the relationships and things that I&#8217;ve had, how to kind of go from what we&#8217;re, not even taught, but how we&#8217;re built to think like employees. And I&#8217;m not saying that in the derogatory sense, but there&#8217;s certain brain patterns that I had that didn&#8217;t help me scale what I was trying to build. And I feel like I&#8217;ve finally broke some of those thought patterns, which have really helped me figure out, in addition, tiring business coach, which was part of the growth, but learning how to not be in the business, but work on the business.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I mean, there&#8217;s a whole bunch of learning lessons, but essentially, me being able to, in a year where everybody was inside and where everything was becoming digital, or a lot of money was being allocated to digital events, digital this, digital that, AR/VR, being able to see a whole change in the market, in addition to finally, with the market change, seeing where I fit into it, as well as how to scale my business in that market change. Those are like the three things that have been highly, I guess, learning lessons when I&#8217;m continuing to learn and just been beautiful things in the past year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes. And I have to say, it&#8217;s good that you&#8217;re learning that in your first year of business. There&#8217;s a lot of businesses that don&#8217;t get that until maybe year two or three after they&#8217;ve gone it alone and figured out that&#8217;s not the best way to do it. I like that part you said about being in the business, but not really working on the business. So it&#8217;s good that-</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Which is still hard because I have to be on camera [inaudible 00:07:06]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I mean, but hey, that&#8217;s your business, though, right? That&#8217;s Groce media. What&#8217;s a typical day like for you?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I can tell you what I would like to have my typical day be. It&#8217;s only in bouts of stress like this last week where I just throw it all away. Typically, I wake up at 6:00. I&#8217;m very structured, man. I get thrown off if you ask me to do anything outside of my routine in the morning. I don&#8217;t care if I wake up at &#8230; like today, I woke up at 9:00. I must get on my little cycle, must be either 15 minutes or three miles. I listen to audio books, while I&#8217;m on the cycle. I must take a shower after that, make my coffee, and then I make a list for what needs to get done that day, and then I sit in my chair for &#8230; I honestly don&#8217;t like to. If I can get all my work done before like 1:00PM because I know as soon as I eat, I&#8217;m tired. So I try to get &#8230; And this is why I went on a break last week and I&#8217;m trying to get my schedule back together, because I had a really challenging three-week, almost a month sprint where I work through the weekends, I typically don&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Yes, from 6:00-7:00, 7:00 to about 1:00, I&#8217;ll probably &#8230; that&#8217;s my work. That&#8217;s where all my everything that must be done is done within that time. And then the rest of the day is just, what other things need to be planned, for example, one of the things I need to focus on is creating SLPs for whoever I decide needs to fill these positions that we were kind of talking about earlier. But yes, I mean, morning and till 1:00PM is kind of pretty structured after that. It just depends on what I want to do or what extra, like what would I have to be doing tomorrow that I can do today, but I am pretty regimented and I try to keep in mind that I know my brain is only probably optimal for like four or five hours of really good like no distraction related work. After that, I&#8217;m like &#8230; The bunnies and the Chipmunks they&#8217;re running around my brain at that point. No way. I&#8217;m not sure that answers your question. But that&#8217;s literally my typical day and Saturdays and Sundays in working is different, is typically strategizing in reading on Saturdays and Sundays. It&#8217;s not sitting at a computer. I don&#8217;t necessarily consider it work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, but you&#8217;ve got that structure down, which I think probably helps out from day-to-day to make sure that you stay on task.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
That&#8217;s one thing that I know I&#8217;m really good at, is habits usually. And my dad is this way too. I got it from him. And people always yell at us, they&#8217;re like, there&#8217;s like an hour in the beginning of our days that you just can&#8217;t disrupt or we even have &#8230; There&#8217;s literally a calendar. Actually, I&#8217;m going to bring my dad into this. But he has a phrase like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t eat cake on Tuesdays.&#8221; And we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Why specifically Tuesdays?&#8221; But there&#8217;s a reason and he sticks to it. I&#8217;m the same way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look, we all got to have our rules. We got to have our structure that gets us through things, I think especially since this past year, people have just had to discover and develop their own kinds of habits to get through. So it&#8217;s not a bad thing, I don&#8217;t think. What are some projects that you&#8217;re working on now?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
So with everything going digital man, do you know what virtual production is?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Virtual production?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where it is?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
What it is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, I know what it is. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
All right. Have you seen these people on the internet with mocap suits? You&#8217;ve seen these &#8230; and they&#8217;ve been around for a while, but they&#8217;re starting to pop up a little bit more. For example, you have AiAngel, CodeMiko, you have these virtual influencers, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes, yes. I&#8217;ve seen those.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
All right. So I have been studying how to do &#8230; I have a beta version of this stuff made. So I have a car, I have a city. You&#8217;ve probably seen it in my live streams, but I&#8217;m just getting my character made. I hired somebody to make my character and we&#8217;re going to start building in the metaverse. With the tournament that we were talking about a little bit earlier, designoff.live. It&#8217;s basically, think esports, but for design, and I really want that event to be almost like a virtual music concert/tournament. Do you play games Maurice?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I do.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
What games do you play?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;ve got a switch. So I&#8217;m not going to lie. I&#8217;m mostly playing Animal Crossing these days because-</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Oh, my God.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; it&#8217;s just a destresser. Wait a minute, you didn&#8217;t let me finish. You didn&#8217;t let me finish. I mean, I&#8217;m mostly playing that. I do have a PS4 and I&#8217;m between playing Fuser and Persona 5 Royal. So it varies.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Persona 5 brought me back. You reeled me back in. Do you watch Twitch at all? Do you watch any gamers?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve seen some gamers on Twitch. I&#8217;ve watched a few on YouTube also. I know I&#8217;ve watched some people do live streams on YouTube. I&#8217;ve seen some gaming live streams on Twitches as well.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Got you. I think what&#8217;s really missing right now, and it&#8217;s also very challenging at the moment with, everybody&#8217;s on zoom calls, everybody&#8217;s watching live streams of some sort. The thing is, is that, and this has always been the problem even with webinars, it&#8217;s people on stage talking to audience and audience are just chatting. And yes, you can hit the clap button or the heart button or whatever, but I&#8217;ve been watching this one individual, her name is CodeMiko and she does the best. Her avatar and maybe the world that she has isn&#8217;t necessarily to my aesthetic liking, but the fact that she&#8217;s able to allow the audience &#8230; she&#8217;s a developer by trade, and so the audience can input commands or purchase certain things to mess up, or make things happen to her. Either mess up the environment or make things blow up, make her dance, mute her while she&#8217;s streaming. She&#8217;s basically gamified her live stream experience.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
And so you&#8217;re a gamer &#8230; imagine if you&#8217;re watching a live stream of one of your favorite brands, or maybe even one of your friends and you just want to mess with them. And you just drop $1 or $5 and maybe even just type this code and something funny happens on stream. It&#8217;s no longer a one-way street, it&#8217;s a two-way street. And there&#8217;s so many levels of complexity that you can make this, I mean, I really don&#8217;t even think the larger brands are even doing this right. We&#8217;re still at the point where we&#8217;re looking at these large organizations with millions, billions of dollars, and they&#8217;re still doing the side by side conferences, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
With almost like zoom calls. So really what I&#8217;m looking at is how do we bring that sort of CodeMiko entertainment into design, through Design Off as a tournament, almost like, think about it as WWE is like the entertainment version of wrestling, this stuff is not saying what we&#8217;re doing on stage is fake, but it&#8217;s so dramatized, people get hype about it, and it&#8217;s entertaining, bringing that side of things over to the design world. And it also be somewhat of a learning experience as well. So the number one thing that I&#8217;m working on, is designoff.live and other design education related events. And now I&#8217;m so far down the line. I don&#8217;t remember your questions.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, that was it? I mean, I was going to talk about DesignOff and you sort of mentioned what it is and everything, but I was asking, what projects are you working on? I&#8217;m really intrigued by this virtual production, so you&#8217;re going to have like a virtual avatar that represents you. It&#8217;s you, but it&#8217;s not you. Sort of like a VTuber, I guess, right?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
A VTuber essentially except it&#8217;s going to be &#8230; I wish there was like a video podcast, can you bring it up? Think VTuber, but not. VTuber is kind of like it&#8217;s the concept of what I&#8217;m talking about, but it&#8217;s niched into almost like the anime sort of sect, whereas kind of what I&#8217;m talking about. Think about, you&#8217;ve played Assassin&#8217;s Creed, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Or any type of dope 3D video game. Essentially, things have gotten so cheap, Maurice, I have a mocap suit. We&#8217;re about to dive in. My mocap suit was only 2500. I can put on this suit and I can download any character I want from a video game, from whatever, and I can become that. It cost 2500 for that suit, the character is probably between $25 and $100. And as I put on the suit, I become that. And even the scenes are like $25. So the ability to create almost triple A level quality game. And the thing is, is like games, right? You can create your own game, except what I want to do with it, is make it more so an entertainment platform, and also a tournament. So rather than making a game, we&#8217;re doing something a little bit different. We&#8217;re pulling a couple things together. But yes, essentially VTuber, however, it&#8217;s more so taking the thought of making a real triple A game, whether that be the latest Assassin&#8217;s Creed or some other high graphic game, basically utilizing Unreal Engine in its capabilities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m very intrigued by that. I really want to see how that will come forth in the future, especially with people have virtual reality headsets and stuff like that, like how all of this will kind of work together because I do see things going certainly more into this, I hate to say the virtual world because I&#8217;m sounding like I&#8217;m a kid in the &#8217;90s. Remember when the virtual world was like a thing in cartoons and television series? We&#8217;re going to the virtual world. That&#8217;s sort of what this feels like, but it&#8217;s actualized. You can do it. It&#8217;s in the realm now that any consumer can probably get into, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Yes, man. The costs are really low. Things are going to be crazy man. At the end of this podcast, people are going to be like Brandon has his screws loose, someone get him a Home Depot set, used to call it, but yes. The way that I see things going, you were saying the virtual world, I&#8217;m making numbers up, but I really do think that there will be people that live in the virtual world. Have you seen on Netflix the Altered Carbon?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ve heard of it. I haven&#8217;t seen it.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not going to go too much into it because I&#8217;m horrible at explaining. Everybody&#8217;s going to be like, that sounds horrible. But it is a really good series guys. You should check it out. But there&#8217;s people they call the real world the real. And those are the people that live like in virtual reality by choice and these people that live in the real world. I really do think that that will be a choice. You&#8217;re not even a half life of your 100 years. So I really do think in the next 20, maybe 30, you have crypto coming up the ability for people to maybe not even have regular jobs, just play games for the &#8230; not even like streaming, just be able to play Pokemon Go for their income. We&#8217;re going into a lot of things, but I&#8217;m just very excited about the virtual world because like I said, in this, I guess, industry what people will call the world builder, it&#8217;s kind of the metaverse is what it&#8217;s called. And people who create within the metaverse are people that create games, but I think video games is going to be one of the ways that we enjoy life in the future, which is interesting and weird to talk about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, the metaverse. That sounds like another &#8217;90s cartoon. I&#8217;m not saying that to be derisive or anything, but it sounds really cool. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. That stokes the inner child in me to be like, &#8220;Oh, what is this about?&#8221; Even as you mentioned Altered Carbon and kind of, I guess, notion of being able to sort of have yourself inside of the metaverse. I don&#8217;t know, it reminds me of this anime, and you&#8217;ve probably seen it called Serial Experiments Lain.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Serial &#8230; No, but I&#8217;m writing it down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s streaming on anything, and I know if Cat Small is listening, this will make I think the second time I&#8217;ve mentioned it on the show. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s available to stream, but it&#8217;s a 13-episode series about this girl named Lame and how she gets sucked into this online internet world. I think if you like Altered Carbon, you would like that show.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes. So to bring it back to the real world for a minute, I can&#8217;t help but notice, of course, in your photo that people can see you for the cover art that you&#8217;re holding this neon, Adobe XD logo cue, which Adobe XD appears to be your kind of main tool of choice. Talk to me about that. How did you land on Adobe XD?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s not just the Adobe XD that&#8217;s part of it, but it&#8217;s more so about the Adobe brand in particular. I&#8217;ll explain that. So Adobe XD just because &#8230; and I can&#8217;t just say just because, because my main skill or my main trade is UI/UX design and being able to &#8230; there&#8217;s a couple of reasons, right? Have a company that offers not just the &#8230; it offers the suite of not just what I have done that produced my income, as a UI/UX designer, XD, but they also have Photoshop, Illustrator, they also have After Effects, Premiere, they have everything at really one cost. And so the larger picture I see is, I have to be careful what I say here, because it&#8217;s not necessarily true. We&#8217;re moving in a space where AR and VR is going to be what UI/UX designers are as of right now.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
When COVID came through and everything started to become remote, I saw a huge uptick in the need for UI/UX designers. Why? Because everybody&#8217;s at home. And the companies who have these streaming platforms and who have digital experiences, their revenue is skyrocketing because everybody&#8217;s on their some sort of screen. And the next version of that is yes, we have screens now, but you have companies like Snapchat, even though their glasses technology looks a little bit funky at the moment. Did you see that release this week?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Of the new like specs?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Specs. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Yes. So it looks a little funky, but that is version 0.01, that&#8217;s essentially a beta version of what I think the iPhone was when it first came out. It doesn&#8217;t look sexy, but the idea is there. Being able to wear a set of spectacles where your friend could decide, hey, I want to wear this pirate hat and I&#8217;m going to press this, anytime anybody has a certain type of technical optic and looks at me, they&#8217;re going to see my digital outfit. So that&#8217;s also the metaverse. So you could decide on your app or whatever, or you. You can be like, I want to wear X, Y, and Z. You put that in your phone and if I&#8217;m looking at you with these spectacles, I can see everything that you decided to wear in the digital space, while also in the real world. I just find that being a lot more attractive to me, just because the sky&#8217;s the limit on what you can do, you&#8217;re no longer limited to 1920 by 1080, you&#8217;re not limited to what are the 320 by whatever 568, someone&#8217;s going to be like, hey was the pixel off, right in the comments, guys.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
But yes, I think that&#8217;s the next step because the sky&#8217;s the limit, the only thing that you&#8217;re really limited by is the hardware, but for screen experience, when we can just create experiences on the things that we look at, man, that&#8217;s crazy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes. And so tools like Adobe XD, or even like the Creative Suite really kind of play into that more.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Yes, because you are able to use like &#8230; This is the thing. When you have things like, whether it be Figma, Sketch, whatever else is out there, you have specific tools for specific things. But when the market starts to become more complex, and you need to be able to adapt, what is their lifespan looking like? And I&#8217;m just like, that&#8217;s great. They&#8217;re a specialty tool. That has some market share. In the larger scheme of things where I think things are going, and also what I&#8217;m interested in, which is also a large factor, this is probably where my biases, because there&#8217;s still going to be screen experiences needed. There&#8217;s still people trying to get their mobile out here and their million dollar companies out here, trying to get their mobile app out.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
So yes. I just like to be on the cutting edge of things and being a part of technologies that allow flexibility and also the integration of where things are moving. So you have Adobe dimension is a 3D tool that allows designers, is also by Adobe, without really any 3D knowledge knowing how to make stuff you just need to know how to download models, change the color them and then use your brain to rearrange them in the way that you think looks best, export that, drop that in, whether that be Photoshop XD, it just makes &#8230; Adobe&#8217;s tagline really does hold up or it&#8217;s just like creative for all. They reduce the barrier to entry and reduce the complexity of what it takes to create something.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know for a while in the design industry, there was this big, I don&#8217;t know, I felt like there was this big push away from Adobe tools. I feel like it was right around the time Adobe Creative Cloud became a thing with their subscription. And lot of designers I know really pushed away from it trying to find some alternative, and they doubled down on Sketch, which is still Mac-only, or they used Figma, or they&#8217;re using other tools like that. But I mean, the way that Adobe has been innovating over the past few years since they&#8217;ve started Creative Cloud, probably because a lot of subscription money, I&#8217;m not going to lie, but the way that they have innovated over the past three years has been nothing short of remarkable. And, I mean, I hate to say there&#8217;s not really any other tools out there that can touch what Adobe is doing. This is not an Adobe sponsorship, by the way, although if you all are interested, let me know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m just saying this because personally, I cut my teeth on Adobe. I learned Photoshop and Illustrator on my own. I just did an interview earlier today where I was talking about how I didn&#8217;t start out in design, I started out doing customer service stuff after I graduated from college. And I would go to Barnes and Noble and pick up .Net magazines, and those like UK computer magazines that would always come with a CD or something, or those Photoshop tips and tricks books. I go to Barnes and Noble, get those, look through them, take pictures, take them back home, I used my pirated copy of Photoshop to try to get my design chops up and stuff. Of course, now that I&#8217;m in a position where I can pay for it, I do pay for it. But I say that to say in terms of the amount of innovation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, Photoshop is a verb for a reason. I mean, nobody&#8217;s out here saying they&#8217;re going to Figma their photos.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
No, I don&#8217;t even think you can Figma a photo, sadly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Look, where I work at now, I asked them for an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription because I wanted to work on some design stuff. And they were like, &#8220;But, we have Figma&#8221;, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, that&#8217;s okay. That&#8217;s all right. That&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I think there&#8217;s no right or wrong. I think there&#8217;s just certain &#8230; like I said, there&#8217;s a market for a reason, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
There&#8217;s particular individuals that there needs really line up with Figma. They were free. They had all this stuff for free. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
What they had was, for a lot of people, they&#8217;re like, why not? But like you said, when you find yourself in a position, and you&#8217;re like, I have the resources now to allocate to a tool that allows me to do more of my best work. That&#8217;s kind of the mindset that, when you have that mindset, you have the resources to actually put it towards something that makes you do your best work. For me, that just happens to be Adobe, because the type of work that I do requires a lot of cross threading.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s fair. Yes. And I mean, also with these Adobe tools, I mean, they&#8217;ve been industry standard for a reason. Every design job I&#8217;ve had, I&#8217;ve still had to use Dreamweaver or Photoshop or something. But I can see why these other types of tools have become more popular, because they have been brought up as the industry changes. There&#8217;s been a huge influx of UX/UI designers and product designers in the past, like seven years or so. And so there has to be tools then that can kind of work with that. I know, for a while, people are trying to use maybe Photoshop or Illustrator to do that, but needed something that was maybe a bit more, I don&#8217;t know, exact, I guess, because Illustrators are for vectors, Photoshop is for photo manipulation, and if you&#8217;re trying to do something that&#8217;s more product-based, you&#8217;d need a tool that, I guess, would allow you to simulate some of those things, which of course, is why Adobe XD comes along, but then also why you have a Sketch and a Figma, or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The tools match what the industry is doing at the moment, so I can see that. Yes. Kind of switch gears here a little bit, I know you are located in Maryland, is that where you&#8217;re originally from?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I think so. Guys, for those of you guys who are listening, Maurice asked me before the podcast, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Brandon, where are you currently residing?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;First off reside is a too big word to even use in a sentence with me.&#8221; And then I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t even know my street address barely.&#8221; But yes, Maryland is I think where I&#8217;ve always been. I have been to Texas though. I&#8217;d lived there for a little bit. And I love the heat over there, man. Love that it doesn&#8217;t get cold. But yes, I&#8217;ve been in Maryland for the majority of my life span of 27 years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. What was it like?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
And this is also what is interesting because people ask me about life and I talk about the internet. I really didn&#8217;t go outside much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So growing up you were the kid that was like always in the house on the computer.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Oh, yes. Yes. Even if you look at my Facebook profile pictures and you look at the &#8230; There was one day where I was looking at some of my high school friends and their pictures versus mine. I was like, oh, hang out with people. And so the majority of my childhood was wrestling in Brazilian jujitsu, because I was a very active, like I said, I can&#8217;t really sit in the chair, I had a lot of energy. So the majority of my childhood starting at eight, up until whenever college started after high school was Brazilian jujitsu, and just teaching and training both kids and adults. I have a brown belt Brazilian jujitsu. I stopped after I moved to Texas and trained a little bit here and there on and off. Business is a lot like jujitsu, except you don&#8217;t get physical ailments from it. Unless, right now I have a pinched nerve for sitting in my chair, so I&#8217;m really lying.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you&#8217;re like street fighter, basically.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I mean, you can say that, but I&#8217;m definitely the first one to run. If you were with me, I have &#8230; Maurice, let me tell you this real quick. Back to my anxiety and paranoia. I&#8217;m not sure if it runs in my family, but I am the first one. We&#8217;re about to go to the storm, it&#8217;s an actual phrase. Let me grab my pepper spray. I don&#8217;t know what it is. I was talking to somebody about this the other day. I like to be overly prepared, because I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to go down. And I&#8217;m not saying I live in a bad area, and I think that&#8217;s also from jujitsu to where is a mindset kind of came where it&#8217;s the paranoid survive. And that&#8217;s kind of how I operate. Some people think that&#8217;s very, a chaotic way to live, but for me, it&#8217;s like hey, that&#8217;s the way that I operate. I try to be always overly prepared. You never know what&#8217;s going to happen and you try your best to optimize what based on the situations that you&#8217;re in, which is also probably why I don&#8217;t leave the house a lot. There&#8217;s a lot of stimuli out. I can control everything that&#8217;s artificial, which is in the computer. [crosstalk 00:32:40].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. But, I mean, even like, still to that point, I guess you were still, I&#8217;m assuming, exposed to a lot of design and tech growing up perhaps.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
A lot of art, or a lot of books. A lot of books, a lot of puzzles. Yes, that&#8217;s all I did, man. Man, I was a hustler. I would resell things that I found at school back to kids, I would sell like art lessons in elementary school and make money so that I really use this money to, or the quarters my parents left in the couch, to purchase puzzles that I would put together, or my grandmother would always buy me these things called Zoids. Do you remember those?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Zoids?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
They&#8217;re essentially like Gundams, but they&#8217;re like cats, or different animals.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hadn&#8217;t heard of those.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t remember what year they were, but they were like my thing. I would put them together without the instructions. And these things were like hundreds of pieces. And I would just figure it out. And honestly, my main superpower that I think is like, I&#8217;m just like, oh, that was the wrong hole, we got to figure the other hole out. I&#8217;m very good at putting things together. And that&#8217;s why I always loved art and expressing things, but I also loved creating something that worked, which is why I really struggled at the end of high school and even moving into college where it was just, what is technology plus art? And I didn&#8217;t have an internet, around the time I was 18, I was like, oh, we&#8217;re just going to be a tattoo artists somehow without getting any tattoos. That wasn&#8217;t going to fly because who&#8217;s going to hire a tattoo artist without any tattoos? I know I wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You got to start somewhere.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Well, this is true. But I just was not &#8230; I was like, I know I mess up paper. So if somebody comes to me and was like, can I have an owl, and I just mess up one feather and somebody is not going to be happy. So like I said, I really like control and something that you can constantly tinker with. I dabbled in internships at NIH with medical illustration. I thought that was really weird. This is when I learned I really didn&#8217;t like work because, and it was probably around 18, 19 at the time. And I would go there and I would want to learn so much, because these people would show me interesting things and I would spend time trying to learn how to do it. And then they would go out on three hour lunch breaks and I would always go in and ask the question, they&#8217;re kicked back in their chair, and I&#8217;m like, what&#8217;s going on? Nobody does any work here. And I&#8217;m not saying this is what the general workforce does, but I was just very turned off by the lack of &#8230; and it wasn&#8217;t even that the other interns were like that as well, I was very turned off in that environment, that the fact that there are so many interesting things around us and nobody&#8217;s asking any questions.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Yes, so I&#8217;m a tinkerer man. Even though I call myself a designer, I&#8217;m probably more so an inventor mindset than anything else. I really like to learn how things work, we will be in Giant man. And I&#8217;ll be like, I wonder how they package those raisins. I ask questions all the time and I really like to find how certain things are made, especially when things are in alignment with what I do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m going to jump ahead a little bit here, because I feel like just based on what you&#8217;re telling me, I really get the sense that you&#8217;ve had to work a lot to build up your confidence in order to really, one, I think showcase work that you can do and of course, to partner with Adobe and other companies and such like that. How do you build that confidence? What advice would you give out there to somebody that&#8217;s listening that wants to build up that confidence to be like you?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Well, I wouldn&#8217;t say try to be like me. Let&#8217;s pause right there. But I think I have a pretty good &#8230; I didn&#8217;t have this story when we first talked about this in the beginning of the podcast, but it&#8217;s one thing that I hold indefinitely in my head that changed things for me. So in school, school was very hard for me. The way that I was, and that I talked about NIH, was not who I was in early school at all. To be honest with everybody, I don&#8217;t even know how I passed elementary school, middle school, or any. I never did any work. I have no idea. They wanted me out of the classrooms. But I never paid attention in class and mainly because I struggled with the way &#8230; now thinking back, it&#8217;s a little bit clear, I didn&#8217;t understand the instructions that whomever was giving me and how to do certain things. And I was like, why is it this way and not this way? And because I didn&#8217;t understand the way that they were telling me, a lot of the times, I was basically the laughingstock. There was so many times where if I even just dare raise my hand in class, the class will just blow up in laughter, and that really hurt a lot.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
And so a lot of elementary school and in middle school, I just thought &#8230; we were talking a little bit earlier where the kids in the special help class programs. That was me. I think I started reading out loud, even in high school, man. Honestly, that mess sucked. But what really changed was, I would probably always get &#8230; I&#8217;m not even sure you can get D&#8217;s in elementary school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You can.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I probably got them. Yes. And I just remember my mom telling me, as supportive as she could, she was like, you&#8217;re different. You have ADHD. Just please try to pass. And I remember like, yes, it&#8217;s not just one time, but just looking at myself in the mirror, not understanding why didn&#8217;t get things. Thinking back about it, don&#8217;t make me feel good. But there was just one day where I was just like, for whatever reason, I just decided on the dumbest thing ever to Maurice. It was a spelling test. So I was like, I&#8217;m going to just try and spell probably like because and I spell it because. I don&#8217;t remember what it was, but I decided to stay up really late and just study 10 words probably what it was. And I got an A. I remember running home from the bus with the paper in hand to tell my mom. Damn, I can&#8217;t even tell this story. Shit hurts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, I didn&#8217;t mean to-</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
No, you&#8217;re good because it&#8217;s a really good story, man. And then I opened the door and I said, &#8220;Mom, I got an A.&#8221; And she hugged me and I remember I went upstairs after that and I was so pissed, Maurice, that I listened, for I don&#8217;t know how many years, to people telling me that I was slow. Regardless of the tears dropping, it was like in that moment that I realized that I had let people tell me things about me that I accepted. I got so pissed in that moment. I was like, I will never, ever, ever allow somebody to tell me what I can and cannot do. And I probably threw a castle around in my building or in my room, something like that.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
But yes, it was a spelling test. Yes, it was something minimal. But it was like that big lesson that how, me, other people, what stories that we hold in our heads and that we apply to ourselves, and that weigh us down in terms of what we actually think is possible. And I&#8217;m not religious or anything. I found recently in the Bible, Exodus 3:14. And don&#8217;t forget who asks, but they essentially ask God, what his name is, what he&#8217;s called, and he says, I am.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I was thinking about this school period or this anger, or whatever this experience that I had that made me feel less than, and I was like, why? Why would he say I am? And I was like, he&#8217;s probably so woke, that he understands and doesn&#8217;t even give the ability to somebody else to even label whatever he is. He just is, or whatever it is. And I was like, wow. Regardless of who said that shit, that&#8217;s some powerful stuff. I am. That&#8217;s something that really sticks with me because I live &#8230; this is a little bit going into talking about the imposter thing. I just understand that I&#8217;m an entity that becomes whatever I decide I would like to become. I come with a biological technology that allows me to pick up and put down whatever it is that I desire within my capabilities of operation.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
So long story, how can somebody become more so of themselves rather than like me? It takes time. I happened to find it studying 10 fucking words for a spelling bee and realizing that I was holding people&#8217;s stories of me and I never crafted my own. So every day, I hold myself accountable to what story, what I like to tell the world about me. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s highly important. And I changed from day-to-day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, that&#8217;s really powerful.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I hope so. I hope it was worth the tears. It dropped in my tea.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I can&#8217;t drink that any longer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to keep on that same vein, not trying to make you continue to cry, but-</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Two tears, we&#8217;re done. [inaudible 00:42:45]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
As you have said, you&#8217;ve managed to kind of instill this confidence now within yourself where you don&#8217;t take in other people&#8217;s thoughts or stories about who you are. And to that end, you have this very unique personal brand, which you&#8217;ve taken time to craft, like I said, I&#8217;ve watched your videos, I&#8217;ve seen your photos, looked at your Instagram, etc. How can someone out there listening start to create their own personal brand? Is it more of the same process that you talked about?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Yes, it&#8217;s really getting in tune with what it is that you produce and that you want to produce. I think it&#8217;s really important we produce things on autopilot. Like you by yourself, or me by myself, I&#8217;m more likely than not, I&#8217;m probably talking to myself, regardless of where I am, which probably makes what I do very natural. And that&#8217;s why the acting thing probably seems natural, because I do &#8230; Man, I talk to myself in the shower. My partner&#8217;s like, &#8220;Who the hell are you talking to?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like talking to Sarah, Jamil, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;They&#8217;re in my head. They&#8217;re talking.&#8221; We have yet to be tested for schizophrenia, but there&#8217;s probably a little dose of that in there.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
But I think it&#8217;s really important to know what you enjoy and what you do naturally, that is, the way you don&#8217;t have to try too hard, but understand where your natural abilities and occurrences lie. It&#8217;s not just that because you have to also understand what people enjoy about that. But you have to find what people like and value. For example, you could be funny to yourself, but are you funny to other people? So for example, when I was young as in high school, I was picked on a lot. And it wasn&#8217;t until I started saying the dumb shit that was in my head right back at the person where other people started dying, laughing about what I said. I was like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s funny.&#8221; And so this is when I started &#8230; when I realized I was like, &#8220;Oh, I do this naturally. Are there other people that are funny that I can study that could help me enhance what I do naturally?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
So I&#8217;ve watched so much Katt Williams, man. I watch a lot of comedy to help me enhance what I&#8217;m naturally capable of and find people other &#8230; but I sound crazy, but I was about to say other avatars, other people who are built with almost somewhat of the same things that I see in me and just take what they&#8217;re doing and try to evolve my skill set from what they&#8217;re doing. I try to find who I would be in the future based on what I know about myself, and what I see in them and try to take what they have already done and apply it to what I&#8217;m doing today. I study &#8230; yes, I said Katt Williams, but I try to read as much as possible bibliographies because there&#8217;s frameworks, these people who have lived like hundreds, thousands, I don&#8217;t know how long the earth has been here. But there has been a repetition of your DNA and capabilities somewhere in the universe. Imagine if you were able to find throughout a couple of books, who you want to be or who you think you&#8217;ll be sprinkled throughout books, and just in a couple paragraphs, you can take those learnings and apply them to the frameworks that you walk about life with. The reason I read is to build the character that I&#8217;d like to see.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I think of myself as a computer, essentially. I download software through books, or through watching people, or through whatever type of input, but it&#8217;s really important that I understand who I would like to become and find frameworks through multiple ways to craft said character. And I know that with the words that I&#8217;m using, some people will be like, that doesn&#8217;t sound good. This goes back to that first story, I told, would you rather be told who you are, or create who you want to become, or who you are, rather? And that&#8217;s just how I go about building my character?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you appreciate the most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Honestly, probably my time with my partner and the freedom, that&#8217;s first. And then the freedom to just think about what I want to put out into the world and have time to do that and have a community and people around me who also are trying to strive for the same things and working together and building that idea. So my relationships, my free time, and my ability to, with that free time, think about what I want to put into the world and produce and what impact that has.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Speaking of that, what kind of legacy do you want to leave behind? When you look at yourself, say in the next five years or so, what&#8217;s the sort of work that you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
The impact is just possibility, man. Through this design, I&#8217;ll be able to have people understand that you can learn all day. You can be on YouTube and just learn, but just through doing and having fun, and just be tinker, just tinker and build what you want. That&#8217;s what makes you learn. And to facilitate that, just how Dean Kaymer has, that&#8217;s something I&#8217;d like to do in addition to some, not entirely sure even what to call it, but because we are going to be getting into the metaverse and being able to produce quality 3D movies almost, but just because of our virtual setup. I would also like to do some storytelling as well. We&#8217;ll see. The combination of both.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can see storytelling. You got the voice for it.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So just to wrap things up here, Brandon, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
For sure, you guys can find me &#8230; If you just type my name into Google, you&#8217;ll find me. Brandon Groce, G-R-O-C-E. If you guys want to participate in DesignOff, you guys can go to designoff.live. The majority of my stuff, you guys can find me on Instagram, that&#8217;s probably where I&#8217;m most active, or you guys can join our amazing discord community with over 1,000 other creatives from all over the world and not just UI/UX designers and we have illustrators, 3D artists, we literally have, I think there&#8217;s more people from other countries than where I&#8217;m at. So it&#8217;s really nice to have people who are not just in one vertical, but can help each other build on top of something. So short answer, Instagram at Brandon Groce, YouTube, same thing, but if you find me on Instagram, you&#8217;ll find me everywhere else.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Well, Brandon Groce, I definitely want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I honestly want to sharing your story and being as open and candid as you were to share it. I think it&#8217;s important for people to see the path that people take to get to where they are. It&#8217;s not always this straightforward, you went to this school, then this school, and then worked at this place. People come into this industry in so many different ways and I think it&#8217;s really important to be able to see how you&#8217;ve been able to make your own place in this industry, how it&#8217;s helped you build your confidence, how you&#8217;ve not only helped to build a community, but also help to empower so many others out there to see the possibilities for themselves that they didn&#8217;t see. So, thank you so much for coming on the show, man. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Brandon Groce:</b><br>
Likewise, Maurice, thank you so much for having me. I appreciate it.</p>

<p>What a difference a few years makes! This is definitely the case with this week&#8217;s guest, Tiffany Middleton. <a href="/tiffany-middleton-2015" data-wpel-link="internal">When I first talked to her on Revision Path</a>, she was just starting out as a junior designer from Childersburg, Alabama working for a Texas-based sports company. Now she&#8217;s a senior art director for FanDuel and has continued honing and flexing her design skills, only this time in the Big Apple!</p>
<p>We started off with a quick check-in, and Tiffany spoke on her interest in mentoring and helping other Black sports designers through a community she created called <a href="https://www.trenchesdot.com/home" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Trenches</a>. She also talked about some of her favorite projects over the past few years, the experience of working for ESPN, and spoke on the confidence she&#8217;s found from fully stepping into her identity and claiming it proudly. Tiffany is all about showcasing the power of the Black creative voice, and you know that&#8217;s definitely something we support around here!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Hi. So I&#8217;m Tiffany Middleton and I am currently a senior art director at FanDuel in New York City. I&#8217;ve been here for about six months and before FanDuel, I spent about four to five years at ESPN on the digital team and then on the social media team.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. How&#8217;s the year kind of been going so far aside from, I guess, starting this new job?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Oh man. I guess I would go back to, I guess, 2020 of how it started and then where I&#8217;m at now. So like I said, before FanDuel, I was at ESPN and I think life for me there was like kind of getting to do your dream job and then coming to a point of wanting a change a little bit. I grew up on ESPN, it was everything for me, I&#8217;m a big sports fan. And when coronavirus happened, to bring it up, I feel like it kind of changed my perspective on not just my life, but also my career in a way where it just made me kind of take a pause and think about what I was doing and if that was the right direction for me. It&#8217;s kind of at a point in my career where I felt like I had achieved everything that I wanted to achieve at ESPN.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
I feel like I learned so much there. I feel like it was one of those. I compare it to [The Warriors 00:04:11] of it&#8217;s a well-oiled machine, it&#8217;s so many talented designers there. There&#8217;s always great work, but I guess I kind of like to put it in a sports perspective of taking a chance on myself and kind of [KD 00:04:25], leaving The Warriors and coming to Brooklyn. So that&#8217;s what I feel like I did. [crosstalk 00:04:29] And I feel like a lot of that happened off of coronavirus because it paused everything, it changed it. So it&#8217;s been going pretty great. It was definitely an adjustment, a different system. So it&#8217;s been relearning everything I thought I knew but from [inaudible 00:04:47] perspective.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, did you take a break between leaving ESPN and starting at FanDuel, or did you just kind of go right into it?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
I pretty much had two days off and I was back into it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Damn, you got to get yourself a break. Wow, two days and you just went right back into it.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the thing. Ever since I&#8217;ve been a kid, my goal has been to be a successful designer. So it was like, I didn&#8217;t know what a break was. Since the last time we talked in six years, I probably have only taken one vacation that&#8217;s been more than four days. I usually go on vacation [inaudible 00:05:24] my computer. It&#8217;s like I didn&#8217;t know how to take a break. So it&#8217;s like coronavirus made me kind of realize I needed to take a break in life. And then it also changed my perspective of design and how I can use that more for a spiritual, more people impact thing versus a success thing.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
I try to use my design in a way of helping other black people get into design and find different careers to kind of outside the box versus doing design to kind of build my own career in a way. I feel like I&#8217;m settled in my career and I feel like now I&#8217;m at a spot where I really interested in mentorship and helping other people out and then collaborating with other designers and also just spreading more awareness about design in general for black people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I want to go back just a little bit to ESPN because, of course, during the pandemic last year, sports were kind of&#8230; Everything sort of took a pause, especially major sporting events. How did that really affect your day-to-day work at ESPN when everything is revolving around regular sporting events?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
So what I did at ESPN right before I left, I worked on the digital content team. So a lot of our work wasn&#8217;t your day-to-day sports on TV. It was more of a very secluded market and we did a lot of stories based off of sports where they were these long form digital visual storytelling pieces. So we told a lot of stories that were kind of about sports and evolved into sport has been none of our day-to-day work revolved around the sports games. So for us, I think one of the departments that probably had a biggest impact of&#8230; We were working even more because we were doing a lot of evergreen stuff before a sport stopped. So once it stopped, it&#8217;s like we started to do more work and more traffic on the site because there wasn&#8217;t these live games. So I honestly started working more when the coronavirus happened, but I was at home, but I was working more. So it was a different pace, but you start to burn out a little bit quicker than you would in an office.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, interesting. I can imagine because you&#8217;re now having to work from home and I think it&#8217;s something&#8230; Certainly when I had guests on the show last year, that was just a big thing for a lot of people to get over because your home is sort of your refuge away from work and now the two locations have merged and you have to kind of find a way to compartmentalize that.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
It&#8217;s no break. And then I got a puppy, so it was just like, I never had a break. I had no space and [inaudible 00:08:15]&#8230; While I was there, they started to have layoffs during coronavirus. So it&#8217;s like, I started to see the impact of it for coworkers and friends. So it started to kind of&#8230; Mentally, it became a tough situation because it&#8217;s like, &#8220;There&#8217;s no sports, are sports going to come back?&#8221; Eventually the coronavirus did affect our team. So right before I left, I had a couple of coworkers that did get laid off. So I think it was just a lot happening at once. And then you see it so close up of the effects of people. Luckily I personally wasn&#8217;t laid off, but just having people that I&#8217;ve worked with for four and five years lose their jobs, it takes a mental toll on you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know exactly what that&#8217;s like. I mean, I was working at a startup last year going into the pandemic and I think it was maybe about two months&#8230; Actually, it was right around this time that we&#8217;re recording, right around this time. Right around Memorial Day that they laid off my entire department, just gone and it does take a toll on you because you say that part about having to learn how to take a break. I had to learn how to take a break really quickly because I went from this kind of go, go, go, rush, rush, rush all the time, traveling with work, to now just you&#8217;re at home. And granted, I&#8217;m in Atlanta and there wasn&#8217;t really that much of a lockdown period, but still, it takes a toll on you. It really does.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Yeah. And see, I was in Connecticut, so it was already feeling like a lockdown place. [crosstalk 00:09:50] coronavirus [inaudible 00:09:50], it was a complete lockdown.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Let&#8217;s fast forward to kind of what you&#8217;re doing now. You mentioned you&#8217;re a senior art director at FanDuel. What does a typical day look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
So my role at ESPN was more so hands-on, building websites and working with developers and kind of taking about a month or two per project, whereas at FanDuel, not only am I managing a team, so I&#8217;m responsible for everything FanDuel Fantasy and [TVG 00:10:23] products and FanDuel Racing. And then just overseeing the designers on my team, approving work and then also creating work myself and then figuring out different systems and trying to rearrange systems that they have in place currently and just figure out new processes. So I went from kind of 90% designed to 50% design and then 50% emails, people managing, processing, strategy. I&#8217;m definitely enjoying it, it&#8217;s definitely a different role. So it&#8217;s just making me see things in a different light and understanding the intricacies of having a great system.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is it different going from a media company to&#8230; Well, FanDuel is what? Entertainment slash gambling sort of, right?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Maybe gambling is not the right word to use there.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the word we want to use, but essentially, I would say more of&#8230; Because I&#8217;ve been playing fantasies, I&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s kind of like a getaway for sports of people still watch sports but I think, especially with social media and Instagram and things like that, something that I did notice at ESPN was people were less likely watching TV. [inaudible 00:11:41] I think they started to do with a lot of cord cutting where I feel like at a company like FanDuel, adding an incentive of betting or a fantasy or just being able to play with your friends and kind of watch a game with a little bit more invested into it, makes it more longevity with [inaudible 00:12:00] sports.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
But you&#8217;re competing with everything else on social media these days. So making that switch from essentially storytelling and it&#8217;s very Print style Magazine type of foundational design to more we do a lot of marketing assets on this end. It&#8217;s a faster pace, a different type of strategy, a different audience that you&#8217;re looking at. Also at ESPN, I was kind of working on user experience and UX and UI. So going from a UX and UI back to kind of marketing design, it definitely took some adjusting to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. Going from that sort of product based work to more, I guess kind of print and web sort of almost, it&#8217;s a big shift.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Yeah. I was using Figma and Sketch at ESPN for my last three years and [inaudible 00:12:53] Photoshop. So it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m having to almost go back to college. The product world is very much different than marketing, like I said, it&#8217;s a whole different thought process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does the design team at FanDuel look like?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
So we have a ACD above me, so he manages our whole department and so it&#8217;s him and then it&#8217;s me and my counterpart. And so I oversee half the house and my counterpart oversees the other half of the house. Like I said, I do fantasy and racing. So racing includes TVG, which is a horse racing product. And then FanDuel Racing, which is our in-house horse racing product. And then my counterpart, he does FanDuel SportsBook and then FanDuel Casino. And then under us, it&#8217;s senior and junior and regular designers. And then we have a copywriting team that we work counter with. And then we have a project managing team that we work with. So it&#8217;s a bigger team than&#8230; Well, not bigger, but a little bit more diverse as far as the copywriters, editors and designers on our team as a whole. When we&#8217;re on meetings, we&#8217;re all together versus at ESPN, a lot of our meetings were more just in the design department. I did work with a lot of writers, but not as closely as we work with our copywriters and project managers at FanDuel.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Have you all started to kind of go back into the office yet? Or is it still remote?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
We&#8217;re still remote, so I haven&#8217;t met any of my coworkers in person. I&#8217;ve only seen them on Zoom.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And you&#8217;ve been there now, like you said, for just a couple of months now.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. All right. Well, hopefully soon once these mandates lift, I feel like there&#8217;s already this rush to get back to normal. I&#8217;m using the air quotes over here. So that&#8217;ll probably happen sooner rather than later. When it comes to working on new projects, what does the creative process look like? Because like you said, the team is pretty varied in the structure and even the type of designers that you have.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
So I think the biggest difference, especially from ESPN to this job is that at ESPN, a lot of the projects, it was a free range of the imagery you can use as far as the athletes. Whereas at FanDuel, we have to use a lot of stock imagery or more your foundational design stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
So when we&#8217;re concepting, it&#8217;s like, you really have to rely on your design skills versus at ESPN, I felt like if you have a nice photo of LeBron and great typography, it&#8217;s a pretty solid design. Whereas here you have to really work to kind of use what you have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And that&#8217;s because you&#8217;re not necessarily working directly with the teams or with the photographers [crosstalk 00:15:43], you have to kind of sell the concept of sports without the actual athletes in that way.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Exactly. So it is a different task.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at some of the work that you&#8217;ve done over the past five to six years, it could be stuff at FanDuel, it can be stuff at ESPN or whatever, what have been some of your favorite projects?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Ooh, that is a very hard one. I think my favorite project is going to be a project I did right before LeBron&#8217;s time with the Lakers. So we hired an artist from every state where every NBA team is and did these LeBron billboards, which is a pretty cool project. It took a lot of time just finding the right artist in the right states and then collecting their work. And then we did kind of a website part to it. But just seeing the different artists come up with these different concepts that are very true to their states and very true to the teams that they were trying to get LeBron to come to, was probably my hands down favorite project. I mean, it became a big deal of in Louisiana, I think they actually put up some of the billboard.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Somebody purchased the art and they put a billboard in Louisiana and then the LA one was pretty great, which the artist who did that ended up putting those on a t-shirt and I had one. So it was just one of those projects that you don&#8217;t really get a lot of chances to work on. So I was very grateful to have been assigned that project, but it also took a whole lot of work because I was excited for it to be done with, but still when I look back, I think that&#8217;s probably one of the funnest projects that I worked on throughout my career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, when I had you back on the show, back in 2016, you were in Dallas, you were just starting out at Panini America, I remember it&#8217;s a company. I think they make trading cards, right?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s sports trading cards. How did you end up getting connected with ESPN and eventually making it to New York?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
So super funny, but Twitter. Twitter is the funniest thing. So right when we probably were chatting maybe two months before that, I actually had applied for a job at ESPN. They flew me out. I met one of the creative directors there via Twitter and he connected me with a potential job. I went to Connecticut and I end up not getting the job and I was devastated, super sad, but then a month or two later, I end up getting a job in Panini America. And probably two months after we talked, if not sooner, I got an email from the same creative director, and he reached out about a potential part-time job with ESPN, working on Snapchat, at the time Snapchat Discover was not a thing, but that&#8217;s kind of how I started. So I was working at Panini America full-time and then I started working with ESPN part-time and within a year, they offered me a part-time position in Connecticut, but I was hesitant to kind of move for a part-time position, but they made things work to where it worked out logistically for me.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
So I end up leaving the job in Dallas after a year, moving to Connecticut, working part-time for a couple of months. And then I end up getting an opportunity to work full-time, which I switched from the social media team to the digital content team. So it was kind of this blessing in disguise that I didn&#8217;t even know. Like I said before we talked, I had gotten denied from ESPN and I was devastated. And then within a year, I was in Connecticut, working there and it was a full circle moment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). How was it adjusting to the city and everything?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
I moved from Dallas to Connecticut. So I&#8217;ve been in Connecticut pretty much the last five years or so. And [crosstalk 00:19:36] I met friends in Connecticut and we would spend a lot of time in New York City. And so eventually I was like, I need to move to New York because I&#8217;m going [inaudible 00:19:45] Connecticut, but it&#8217;s not a lot to do there. Especially [inaudible 00:19:49] Dallas or New York, it&#8217;s nothing to do there except for work. So I always moved to Connecticut envisioning that I will live in New York City. I just didn&#8217;t think I would be in Connecticut that long. So coming to New York has been a big adjustment, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve really experienced New York because coronavirus.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah. That makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
[crosstalk 00:20:10] living here, I&#8217;ve been here on the weekends, but I haven&#8217;t lived here when it wasn&#8217;t coronavirus, but it&#8217;s starting to pick back up. But just being here for five or six months, the amount of black creatives that I&#8217;ve been able to meet compared to living in Connecticut or even Dallas is 10 times twofold.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh really? Okay.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
So many more black creatives, just different people that I would not have crossed paths with in life if I hadn&#8217;t lived in New York and especially within Brooklyn itself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now are these other black designers in the sports and entertainment industry or just black designers in general?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
So some, a handful are probably in sports entertainment and then some are just within the industry of just creative and fashion. But actually at ESPN, I did meet a lot of black creatives, some weren&#8217;t designers, but photographers, videographers, producers, just a wide range. So it&#8217;s like, ESPN was very much majority white, but I did meet a lot of black people that were creative, just within smaller groups.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. That&#8217;s good to know. I mean, I would imagine, like you said, with the pandemic, that does make it difficult now to really meet folks. I can&#8217;t wait to go back to New York. When I used to work for a company in New York, I didn&#8217;t like it because I would go to New York and I&#8217;d think, &#8220;Oh, work.&#8221; But before then, I loved going to New York. So I&#8217;m looking forward to going back up there when I don&#8217;t have to work. And just kind of experiencing the city, New York is fun. It&#8217;s fun. I don&#8217;t know if I could ever live there, so props to you for that, but it&#8217;s a great city, especially for, like you said, meeting other black creatives and stuff. That&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did it take a lot to kind of adjust to the city?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
I think because the last two years I&#8217;ve been back and forth&#8230; I kind [inaudible 00:22:04] neighborhood, I have friends that lives pretty close, so it&#8217;s like I got here, everything kind of just centered around me. I already kind of had people that I knew, I already had spots that I knew, but I think it&#8217;s definitely different than Connecticut because it moves very fast. There&#8217;s a lot going on. And me growing up in the South, every time my family comes up to New York, they absolutely hate it after [inaudible 00:22:29]. [inaudible 00:22:33] overload of people, overload of things, it&#8217;s just a overload. So [crosstalk 00:22:39] sometimes it can be tiring, but I also live in Brooklyn. I feel like Brooklyn is more like a neighborhood versus if you go to Manhattan, it&#8217;s more of that New York City vibe, whereas Brooklyn just&#8230; It&#8217;s chill, but you never really know what you&#8217;re going to get when you walk outside.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, certainly, I mean there&#8217;s parts of Brooklyn that are like that. Most places that I&#8217;ve been to in Manhattan&#8230; Unless you&#8217;re going further up like near Harlem or Washington Heights or something, or at least to me, it hasn&#8217;t felt as claustrophobic as if you&#8217;re down in say the Financial District or something like that. But no, Brooklyn is fun. Brooklyn&#8217;s a fun time.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Yeah. No, it&#8217;s very fun. It&#8217;s very quiet. It&#8217;s also very small once you get used to it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Nice. That&#8217;s really nice. So let&#8217;s talk about Trenches. Now I remember when I had you back on the show you were talking about In The Trenches, which was this site that you had created to kind of talk about black designers and the sports and entertainment industry. Has Trenches kind of evolved from that concept?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s evolved as I&#8217;ve evolved, right? Like I said, early on in my career, very focused on just design, design, design. And I think the older I got, the more I really started to look at the spaces that I was in work wise and realizing that, &#8220;Why am I the only black designer?&#8221; And then looking into sports in general and like, &#8220;Why is there only 10 of us?&#8221; Feeling like you&#8217;re in a box that you can&#8217;t quite get out of. And so for me, Trenches kind of started to evolve around just black creatives in general. So I&#8217;m kind of still in this in-between of it&#8217;s sports, but I&#8217;m also trying to break it out more into culture and music. Because I feel like sports is very black on the field, but within the front offices, it&#8217;s usually very non-black. I&#8217;ve tried really hard to focus on black designers in the sports industry, but you just start to kind of run into the same people because it&#8217;s hard to let us in.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
So I&#8217;ve been working with a mentee and she got a job in the sports industry and working at NFL. And I was really proud of that, but it&#8217;s like, we&#8217;re still just fighting just to get in. Last year, I ended up teaming up with some of my friends who some worked at ESPN, some worked at the NBA, they&#8217;re all black women and we did a Zoom conference where it was just black women in the sports industry. And it was just designers, editors, social media managers. And that for me kind of changed the wheel again because it was something near and dear to me. Being a black woman, seeing that many black people that were kind of experiencing the same thing I was experiencing, it made it feel more true to me. So that&#8217;s kind of where Trenches have evolved, is going from sports and design to more just our experiences as black women or black creatives in this industry.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
We sometimes don&#8217;t seem to exist or even when we get there, we&#8217;re dealing with issues that a lot of our counterparts aren&#8217;t dealing with, or even when I think sports is on a general, it&#8217;s so hard to get into. And a lot of times people break into it by doing these free internships. But the reality is there&#8217;s not a lot of people of color, especially black people that can kind of afford to take this free job and have their parents take care of them for a year or so without getting an income. And I think sometimes that pushes us behind and then sometimes I&#8217;ve seen where people, essentially hire people that are the same as them.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
So it just started to seem like a lot of different obstacles that were coming up for black people to be in the sports industry. So it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m still fighting for, but it&#8217;s evolving more into a culture thing because I feel like black people have more space to kind of own their own thing in culture and music versus in sports. It just seems like until the gatekeepers really focus on bringing in black creatives in the sports industry, it&#8217;s always going to be a tooth and nails fight.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting. I didn&#8217;t even think of how maybe these specific kind of niches of design would still unfortunately really have this big diversity problem. And the reason I&#8217;m saying this is because over the past few years, as I&#8217;ve done the show, I mean, there has been an influx of black designers in product and UX like crazy. And I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because of bootcamps or because of other programs or stuff, but you can go in a major city and swing your bag around and hit a dozen black UX folks. It&#8217;s kind of astonishing in a way. I didn&#8217;t even think about how in something like sports and entertainment that there&#8217;s not that many black designers that are kind of making the graphics and stuff like that. Why do you think that&#8217;s the case? Is it because of the kind of old boys&#8217; network?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s a old boys&#8217; network and I&#8217;ll be honest, I think for me, I started to notice it with Trenches because once I started Tweeting out stuff about Black Lives Matter and black designers&#8230; The more I started Tweeting about black people, the less interaction I started to get because I have ran Trenches as if it was this well-oiled company. And I had kept it very corporate and not really personal. And last year when the George Floyd thing happened, it became more personal to me. That&#8217;s when I really, really started to realize, &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re not interacting that much.&#8221; And I think that kind of made me switch it up because I just felt like for years there are a lot of followers that I could kind of name off the top of my head.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
People were very into Trenches, but when it became about humans, it was less support. It was less interaction. It was losing followers. So me being a black queer woman, I couldn&#8217;t fake the funk anymore. It wasn&#8217;t as important to me as livelihood was, I wanted to more so create a platform and a space for people like me that weren&#8217;t really included in those rooms versus people that had always kind of been entitled to that room. So I felt like Trenches was becoming something where even I wasn&#8217;t being accepted in it as I was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You said something really interesting there, I want to kind of draw out a little bit where you said once you started talking about humans, humans play sports too. And I&#8217;m not saying that in a bad way as how you say it, but I know there seems to be&#8230; And this is probably gone back we&#8217;re talking decades, probably OJ and even past them. But there&#8217;s something about America and seeing black athletes, they just don&#8217;t want politics in their sports. They want sports to be this idyllic&#8230; I don&#8217;t necessarily want to say lily-white, but they want it to be this idyllic problem free environments that&#8217;s just about the game. And that&#8217;s not the case, especially when you have black people that are the majority of the players.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, we could talk about this all day, but [inaudible 00:30:08] it&#8217;s a system, right? Because the real thing for me is, like I said, I grew up on ESPN, I loved it to death. I grew up on Slam Magazine, but something I didn&#8217;t realize up until recently was it was not those companies that I was in love with or that I loved, it was that the guys on the field, the women on the field, they reminded me of the people I grew up with. I was able to see people that looked like us on the big screen and that&#8217;s what I was attracted to. So I think once I got to those companies, I started to realize that the people on TV aren&#8217;t the people I&#8217;m working with. So it&#8217;s like they controlled our narrative. And I started to really realize that they control our narrative.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
And I think what I like about LeBron so much is that he was one of the first players that I feel like truly started to own his own narrative. I love Michael Jordan to death. I think he&#8217;s the greatest athlete ever. But if you really think about Michael Jordan, the executives at Nike owned the narrative of who he was supposed to be and who they wanted him to be and who they [inaudible 00:31:13] be. And so I think when designers are designing these graphics, they&#8217;re just essentially using these basketball players and football players that are essentially characters with the tattoos and the dreadlocks and the braids, and they&#8217;re looking cool on these graphics. But if they walked into a store at their homes and they didn&#8217;t have those big names, they might call the cops on them. And that&#8217;s why I said humans of&#8230; Once I started talking about real heart to heart stuff of things that we have to deal with as black people, nobody wanted to entertain it.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t want to be like an athlete that&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Shut up and dribble.&#8221; When I&#8217;m shutting up and Tweeting what you want to see, you&#8217;re cool with it. But when I Tweet something that&#8217;s serious, nobody wants to talk about it. Or when I Tweet about, &#8220;You guys should hire more black designers.&#8221; &#8220;Well, they&#8217;re not qualified.&#8221; Well, why aren&#8217;t they qualified? Is it that they can&#8217;t afford to be in these schools? Or is it that they have the talent, but it&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re looking for? Because for me, I&#8217;ve always thought art is [inaudible 00:32:11]. So I think there is good design and there&#8217;s bad design, but there is a lot in between, as I&#8217;ve seen a lot of black designers get passed up on roles just because their work wasn&#8217;t the way a white designers&#8217; is. So I also realized that a lot of people were getting hired from roles where people whose work I would be Tweeting out. So I just started to feel like I was supporting more non-black designers than I was black designers.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
And that just sit right for me, because I feel like it took me a while to just get my foot into the industry. And I think the people that did let me into those doors, they were all people of color. They were either people of color or white men who weren&#8217;t from America. So my boss at ESPN, he is from London. So it just was something that, it just was so apparent that I couldn&#8217;t not notice it. So that&#8217;s kind of why I kind of stepped away from the sports design thing and just started to focus more on black creators.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Because I would find a lot of beautiful art in Brooklyn or beautiful photographers or things like that. But their work wouldn&#8217;t be sports center, but I just felt like it still needed to be shown and talked about, especially because once I did start speaking about black lives, or I put out the Protect Black Women shirts, 90% of my sales, 90% of the interactions was all black people. It just changed the perspective of I don&#8217;t want to be a sellout and it just felt like I was at that moment without realizing it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting. I have to say, even coming to that realization shows, I think, your growth as a person and as a designer to be able to really survey the field and see that, that sort of what&#8217;s happening and how you can help to counteract that. One of the things that I present when I talk about Revision Path, I tell people to not just be an observer of the problem, but to work to try to be the solution because it can be real easy to just look at the landscape and see that things are messed up. And that&#8217;s all you talk about is how messed up it is. But you&#8217;re not doing anything to counteract that or to be actively against that. So no, I think that what you&#8217;re doing with taking Trenches in that direction is a great thing. And I can tell you, even just from doing this show for however&#8230; 400 plus episodes, the tide is turning in some ways, but it&#8217;s interesting to see how even in industries like sports and entertainment, particularly in sports, that that&#8217;s not the case.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Yeah. It is definitely not the case.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. So aside from Trenches, you mentioned this Protect Black Women shirt. Are there any other projects that you&#8217;re working on?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
That was the last one out, I do you want to relaunch it because I feel like it has more legs and I have some stuff planned for the upcoming year, but I&#8217;m trying to figure out all the logistics, so just stay tuned for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The way that the year is going now, it&#8217;s of course so different from last year. It&#8217;s like, you&#8217;re kind of trying to get your rhythm back in a way after a year of not really being able to do what you do, you kind of have to sort of ease back into it a bit. I&#8217;m trying to think of what other stuff I would want to do creatively this year. And I don&#8217;t know, I need time to think about that. So that makes sense. Now back when I had you on the show, I keep mentioning our old interview, but you told me then that your dream project would be working with Nike. Is that something that&#8217;s still on your design bucket list?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
That has changed completely. So I think for me, the difference between me six years ago and me now is going back to what I just said about just fully stepping into my blackness and understanding that every room I walk into, people are going to see my color first. And I don&#8217;t ever want to take a job where I feel like I might have to lose a part of my culture in the surroundings of where I&#8217;ll be. So for me, A is I visited Portland, I&#8217;d never visited before, but I went there last year, right before coronavirus and my time at ESPN was great. It changed my life, it was a great experience, but I would probably not want to live in a place where the population is less than 20% black and very not diverse. And so A, I would just not want to live in Portland.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
And then B, I think again, kind of going back to growing up on ESPN, especially growing up on Nike, I mean, every shoe I own is pretty much a Nike shoe except for Adidas. But realizing that all of these companies, the one thing they have in common that I gravitate a lot towards to, is black culture. And I think for me now, it&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m realizing that I have what I was looking for and I can kind of do my own thing with it. And I also feel like, not to take anything at Nike or any other company, but sometimes it just feels like it&#8217;s capitalizing on black culture, especially when it&#8217;s such a big brand. And that&#8217;s kind of changed my thoughts about it because like I said, six years ago, I&#8217;m just thinking logistical design stuff, not thinking about any culture perspective or from a person to person perspective.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
And now it&#8217;s like the older I get, I&#8217;m like, I would love to work at Nike. I think they do great design, but I also wouldn&#8217;t want to take a job where I feel like my mental health or my ability to be around my culture might be limited in a way or capitalizing on black culture and not really giving back to it. I think I&#8217;ve turned into this humanitarian type of person. So I would love to work with Nike. I would love to collaborate with Nike, but working at Nike, as an in-house designer, those thoughts are a little bit less now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I have what I was looking for. That is such a powerful statement to say. And you&#8217;re right about how these companies&#8230; Particularly Nike, I mean leans on blackness a lot. I mean, look at their marketing. I mean, look at Kaepernick.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. And I mean, I think they do great work, but if we&#8217;re being in real and you look in the front office, they may not have a lot of black executives. And I&#8217;m one of those people, it might be contradictory or people might disagree with this, but I want to see black people in roles that aren&#8217;t diversity and inclusion or HR roles. I want to see a black design manager. I want to see black people in those roles at Nike where they&#8217;re doing the same jobs as white counterparts, but they just happen to be black. Not that they&#8217;re roles where it&#8217;s a role made for a black person. I just feel like they can add more diversity to the office side</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
In one of your recent Tweets, you said, &#8220;The older I get, the more I simplify.&#8221; How have you simplified your life over the past few years?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Oh gosh. Let&#8217;s see. I think decluttered is the number one word. Not just decluttered my home, decluttered my mind, decluttered my thoughts, but I&#8217;ve decluttered my design process a lot. I think younger me is more into, &#8220;What&#8217;s the coolest design I can come up with?&#8221; Versus now it&#8217;s, &#8220;What is the most practical design I can come up with? What design can I create that isn&#8217;t going to cause any issues with legibility, any confusion?&#8221; Very being into simple. I love fashion, so I have to use Kanye as an example. Kanye from Graduation was wearing backpacks and polo outfits and lots of colors and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
And now [inaudible 00:40:19] Kanye seems like he wears the same thing every day, but he&#8217;s reserving his energy more so he can be more creative. And I start to realize that if I&#8217;m trying to do the best design every single design I do, I&#8217;m exhausting my energy and it&#8217;s causing me to be less creative. So now I&#8217;m being more intentional on textures, backgrounds, fonts, the foundational thing is that I can kind of switch up. So it&#8217;s kind of making this toolkit of accessories or design tools that I use and I kind of switch up and change around. So I still am able to be creative, but I&#8217;m also boxing myself in to where I&#8217;m not exhausting my creative energy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Kanye also got four kids. So I would imagine that cuts down a lot on his own style. Just like, &#8220;Look, give me something simple.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
I was going to say, he&#8217;s also a [inaudible 00:41:15] billionaire, so kids is&#8230; I&#8217;m sure he has people to take care of them to-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
[inaudible 00:41:20] creativity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What keeps you motivated and inspired these days?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Oh, let&#8217;s see. I think black culture does. I&#8217;m big into music. So I think back in my day&#8230; I&#8217;m not even that old, but I feel like back in the day, Lil Wayne, Missy Elliott, their music videos, they used to get me so excited. The conceptual stories behind it, the creativity, still feeling like true to nature, but seeing it on the big screen, those type of things get me excited. So music is continually being my inspiration for just motivated with design and then motivated on side projects or just motivated to do things that can potentially make a small change in this big world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At this point in your career, how do you define success?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
I would say success for me is a peace of mind. Obviously a peace of mind, which seems very simple, but you know how sometimes you get the job that you love, but you never get any sleep, you&#8217;re always tired, you&#8217;re always stressed out, you are just running raggedy? So I think for me it&#8217;s like success has nothing to do with money, has nothing to do with awards and things like that. I think it&#8217;s what gives me gratification, what gives me peace, what makes me feel like I&#8217;ve done what I need to do, but it just doesn&#8217;t cause me regret or cause me a lot of problems. I just feel peace, especially with everything going on, that is what I define as success. Being able to do what I want to do when I want to do, how I can do it without having somebody control that in a way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the thing that I really love about kind of always having some sort of a side project or something. No matter where I work or what I do, I know I&#8217;m always going to have something on the side that&#8217;s just mine that I can do 100%, no outside input or anything like that. So I feel you on that. I actually asked this question in the last interview, I said, &#8220;What advice would you give your teenage self?&#8221; But what advice would you give 2015 Tiffany to help prep her for the future?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Oh man. Patience. Just be patient because things are going to come and they&#8217;re going to come when they&#8217;re supposed to come, not when you want them to come. And that every day may seem like a long day, but when you look back, they&#8217;re short days, but to do something every day that will impact the next day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, what would you like the next chapter of your story to be like, when you look at, let&#8217;s say the next five years, what kind of work do you want to be doing? Where do you want to be? All that sort of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
I think New York is my home for the next five years, at least. So I would definitely like to still be in New York, I would like to do more community events like art shows, maybe do some school programs. Just do more awareness for black designers within sports and just black designers in general. And then I&#8217;ll also probably like to hop my foot back into the product world because I really loved the thought process about that. So just more community events, probably bring Trenches outside the computer and have a outside event and maybe dabble back into product eventually.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think that would be a great idea to do, like a little summer meetup or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;d would be great. When I started doing live shows for Revision Path&#8230; What&#8217;s funny, when we had our interview, I wasn&#8217;t even thinking about taking this offline. I was like, &#8220;This is just going to stay a podcast.&#8221; But I started doing live shows in 2017. And the great thing about doing a live in-person event for black designers is the actual space and community that it creates. It&#8217;s not so much that you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, where people in a place listen to someone,&#8221; or something like that. What it&#8217;s doing is it&#8217;s bringing folks together around a common theme that they may never have found a way to interact with each other in any other sort of way. So the fact that they&#8217;ve managed to come together in this one space that you&#8217;ve made of a meetup or something like that. We&#8217;ve done live shows where people will be hanging around an hour after we&#8217;re done, two hours after we&#8217;re done.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They&#8217;ve closed down the venue, people are still standing outside talking and it makes me wonder what connections have been made from those kinds of events. And if those connections would have even happened, if the event never happened. So I definitely love the idea of doing some live in-person stuff. I mean, I was starting to do a tour in 2020 before the pandemic. We did a live show out in Los Angeles, that was great. Actually we did our 300th episode in New York. That was 2019. I don&#8217;t want to get into that story, but that was a whole other thing. But if you think about doing live events, even just a small 20 person thing or something like that, socially distance, do it, it is such a good time. Not just for you as the host of it, but just for the community that you&#8217;ll be able to bring together around a common cause.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Yeah. No, it&#8217;s actually something I&#8217;m kind of working on right now. So we may have to connect later, but yes, it&#8217;s something I was talking about with the team that I worked on, the Zoom conference with. And then coronavirus happened and it was just not working, but now that people are being outside again, it&#8217;s definitely something that&#8217;s in the works for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, Tiffany, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
So I&#8217;m big on Twitter. I love to Tweet, so you can follow my personal page, it&#8217;s Tiggatip. So T-I-G-G-A tip on Twitter and then also Trenches, just Trenches_ on Twitter and I&#8217;m also on Instagram and not Facebook, but Instagram and Twitter. So @Tiggatip, personal, and then Trenches for Instagram and Twitter.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Tiffany Middleton, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show, coming back on the show, really. It&#8217;s been so great to hear your story of how you have leveled up since I first had you on the show. Back when I had you on back then, I remember saying how fun it was, how much of a treat it was to just talk with you and get a sense of what you&#8217;re doing. And I can hear the maturity and how much you&#8217;ve grown over the past six years just from this conversation. So I&#8217;m excited to see what comes next for you. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I really appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany Middleton:</b><br>
Thanks for having me.</p>
