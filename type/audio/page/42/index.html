Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>Design can be a powerful way to bring people together, and Tim Allen embodies that as the VP of design at Airbnb. He oversees several teams at the popular online housing marketplace, including their newest offering <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/experiences" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Airbnb Experiences</a>, and we spent the first part of our interview talking about how Tim got started at Airbnb, as well as the company&#8217;s open culture.</p>
<p>Tim also shared how growing up and living around the world as a military kid helped inspire his early design work, talked about attending NCSU and working his first design jobs at Interactive Magic and IBM, and spoke on the importance of design leadership and designers as business leaders. Tim truly wants to be a beacon for more Black designers to enter the industry, and he&#8217;s leading by example!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Hi Maurice. I&#8217;m Tim Allen, VP of design at Airbnb, and I look after design functions globally across design, research, UX, writing and creative.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, that&#8217;s a lot to look over.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s quite a bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s a regular day like for you at Airbnb? Does that exist?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know if it does exist in terms of a regular day. It&#8217;s a lot of context switching, I can tell you that. Sometimes I&#8217;ll have a day where I try to avoid these, but it&#8217;s just back-to-back meetings with wildly different contexts for each meeting.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
But typically there&#8217;s some combination of our creative culture. How do we feel that? How do we calibrate it? What does quality look like? Which leads into product. How are we impacting customers&#8217; lives through our product and maintaining quality? Again, that&#8217;s a pretty constant theme.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
And then creatively, how are we creating resonance with our brand? So in some variation, sometimes all three, sometimes just focusing on one, like people. I&#8217;ll have one day where I&#8217;m focusing just mainly on one-on-ones and connecting with folks, making sure folks are being enabled to do the best work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How did you get started at Airbnb?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I got started through a conversation. Much like many other positions I&#8217;ve had. I had a conversation with Alex Schleifer who is our chief design officer and we just hit it off immediately. Our sons are about the same age, so he was actually on his way to pick up his son the first time we chatted. And we started talking about our design ethos and what we believe in. And that pretty much rhymed and that was a great way to start a relationship.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So just had the conversation and then before you knew it, you&#8217;re working at Airbnb.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s pretty good.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
It was a snowball effect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s the best thing about your job?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I guess the best thing about my job, I think it&#8217;s just being creative. Just thinking orthogonally about business challenges, customer and community challenges, and then applying my own sense of tuition and background to those challenges is pretty exciting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Tell me more about the team. You mentioned you are doing a lot of context switching. Talk about the teams that you oversee.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. You have experience design, which is a pretty broad function. We have generalists here, so a good range of folks that either index on visual design or interaction design. Or mostly a combination thereof, but with varying levels of capability on either side of that. You have research and insights, survey science, data science and UX writing, information architecture. There&#8217;s quite a bit of variance there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s interesting that there&#8217;s all those positions at a company that is&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, would you call Airbnb a tech company since they&#8217;re mostly deals, I would say with&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to call it hospitality, but with lodging in a way?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. Accommodations is one big part of our brand. We&#8217;ve recently expanded into just Airbnb experiences where you don&#8217;t have to own a home or have a home in order to be a host basically.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me more about that.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. So Airbnb experiences is all about the best in class experiences. So when you arrive at a location you can feel like you&#8217;re at home and you feel like a local as opposed to feeling like a tourist. We have different categories such as animals just launched recently to a lot of a fanfare. We have a couple of categories that are getting ready to launch soon as well. Cooking is another category that&#8217;s very popular.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
We also have adapted experiences too. So just in terms of inclusivity and accessibility, a lot of times people with mobility impairments or people that are disabled, have a tough time when they&#8217;re traveling, being integrated into experiences. And so we have a whole host of adaptive experiences that are specifically catered towards disabled and the combinations that are required.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, it&#8217;s not even so much&#8230; It almost sounds like a built in almost a package in a way. Of course with Airbnb you&#8217;re renting out someone else&#8217;s space, but it sounds like with this it also lumps in different activities you could do, like maybe going out to eat or I don&#8217;t know, seeing a play or something like that. Is that a good way of describing it?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean mostly my job is about innovating around the entire consumer journey across digital and offline experiences. From the moment you think you want to go somewhere, as an inception moment through planning, through booking. Obviously through hosting is a big experience in terms of your commendation and the experiences you have while you&#8217;re traveling. And so it&#8217;s like how do you create the best trip possible and make it as magical as possible?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I never thought about it, I guess in an end-to-end sort of way like that. It&#8217;s not just that you&#8217;re providing lodging, you&#8217;re also providing entertainment. You&#8217;re providing&#8230; It&#8217;s almost tourism, I guess, in a way.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. A big part of our brand is around tourism. We have ecotourism category of experiences as well. So yeah, that&#8217;s a good way to think about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Let&#8217;s see. So one thing that I&#8217;ve heard a lot about with Airbnb, we actually have had someone from Airbnb on the show. This was years ago. I don&#8217;t even know if he still works there anymore, but he talked a lot. His name is Ariem Anthony. I think he was in the production design department, but he talked a lot about Airbnb and it&#8217;s very open culture. Is that something that you&#8217;ve experienced since you&#8217;ve been there?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yes, one of the biggest things that drew me to Airbnb was my perception from the outside of the community. And then now that I&#8217;m a part of Airbnb, it&#8217;s definitely rung true. That open theme is definitely there. I think it&#8217;s because of the company mission is resonates so deeply with so many people. It&#8217;s usually the number one reason people join or want to be a part of the company.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
And company missions can be fluff sometimes. Right. But I think the actual intent of delivering on the mission of creating a world where anyone can belong anywhere, so intentionally going after that and then also having the means to deliver against that. I think those two factors create this culture that it&#8217;s like a baseline understanding that people have. This shared purpose that allows people to be open in a different way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I know that&#8217;s something that and really I think in a lot of big tech companies, having an open culture is something that&#8217;s really important because diversity and inclusion is important. They want to make sure that people can bring the notion of bringing your whole self to work. Is that something, I would imagine in your position being a VP, that&#8217;s a really big deal.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, if you think about the long game, the way I think about belonging is almost synonymous with creativity. I think when you overlay the factors that add up to belonging with the factors that enable creativity, they&#8217;re very similar. To a sense of safety with this fearlessness of not creating errors and the openness of communication, feeling like you can contribute. All of these things that when you feel like you belong, it&#8217;s very much a way of cultivating creativity too, which is basically my job.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you help to enable that throughout your teams that you oversee?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Well, one thing I start with is just this foundational representation. I think homogenous teams usually make homogenous products based on homogenous strategies. And that&#8217;s definitely not what we&#8217;re aiming to do. Again, we want anyone to belong anywhere.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
And when you say anyone, how can your team stretch as much as possible across the breadth of human diversity in terms of gender, race or gender identity, orientation, background, ability, disability and so forth? We&#8217;ve got a good range of folks. So you start to get that diverse perspective built in. We don&#8217;t have it solved. I think we still have a ways to go as many organizations do but that is definitely our intent at our foundation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So let&#8217;s switch gears here a little bit. Of course, people know you from that not just your work that you&#8217;ve done while you&#8217;ve been an Airbnb, but also a lot of your other design leadership positions, which we&#8217;ll get into later. But let&#8217;s take it all the way back. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, so my father was in the military, so we moved quite a bit. I actually spent a lot of time growing up in Japan, several years in Okinawa and several years in Iwakuni. And then we moved to California, South Carolina, D.C., Northern Virginia area. And I ended up going to high school and settling in North Carolina. And yeah, went from high school to college and design school in North Carolina as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I saw as I was doing my research, you got your undergrad and you got your graduate degree from NCSU, which we&#8217;ve featured on the site before. We&#8217;ve talked a lot about how great the program is. We&#8217;ve had a few NCSU alums on the show too. What was it like there for you? Paint a picture. What time period is this when you&#8217;re at NCSU?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Oh man. So this was a while back, at NCSU. It was called the School of Design rather than the College of Design. It was&#8230; I want to say it was one of the top 10 design schools or so. So coming into it, for me, was a very big deal. I was so excited to get in. When I first got there, I did feel like a fish out of water though. I was like these are real designers around me. My background is airbrushing so I had my little airbrush compressor and airbrush all ready to do some design work and-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wait wait, hold up hold up, back up. Airbrushing? Like how people airbrushed T-shirts or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah that&#8217;s actually&#8230; So how I got into I guess design or I would say art back then was in high school. Yeah, I had my own airbrush company.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, T-shirts. In sophomore year in high school, my dad got me a airbrush set as a gift because I just drew all the time. I was a big drawer and I just drew cartoons and stuff all the time. And then he was like &#8220;You should try this.&#8221; And before he knew it I was making T-shirts for the basketball team and football team and all my friends. And then that blew up into cars and boats and then I started doing businesses in the area and stuff. And by the time I was a senior had just a whole portfolio of business. Which I use that as a portfolio, which I didn&#8217;t even know what a portfolio was, to get into design school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you were airbrushing T-shirts in the South? I&#8217;m imagining this is probably mid &#8217;90&#8217;s probably.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah you&#8217;re talking about mid &#8217;90&#8217;s.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. You were cleaning up, you were cleaning up because airbrushed T-shirts were pretty big back then.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Huge, man. I had a pretty nice business man as a little high school student. It was good. I just loved doing it. I&#8217;d just stay up. Literally I&#8217;d start, I don&#8217;t know, after dinner ish and just airbrush all the different, I guess clients I had until 2:00 AM or so. Get some sleep and then go to school and handout all the merch.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. So it sounds like your parents were pretty supportive of you using your talent in this way.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean even just introducing the airbrush. It was just really, really supportive of art in general. I know that&#8217;s not always the case but yeah. Yeah, that definitely was the case with my family.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did they introduce you to art and design at an early age or was it something you just picked up?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s interesting because both my&#8230; Well, my mother used to teach art and then my father was just a doodler. And I just would see him doodle and he&#8217;s actually a really good artist and he taught me how to draw when I was super young and then I just kept doing it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. And then that of course inspired you to end up going to North Carolina State. So tell me about the program. Do you feel like it really helped you once you got out there in the world as a working designer?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, I mean I&#8217;d say there was a couple of very fortuitous events that happened and some mentors that sprinkled in there that just fueled the passion I already had around art into design. And not only helping me understand what design is but also how it relates to art. I think I was very fortunate to be in a curriculum that was labeled art and design. So it was this intermix of subjective emotion and then objective problem solving and how those things relate. Still to this day is foundational in the way I approach design. But yeah, the opportunities I had really were straight coming in. One of the professors saw my airbrushing and airbrushing is very volumetric. And that was one of the things that drew me to it. It&#8217;s so easy to shade and so forth.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
And so he&#8217;s like &#8220;You know what, 3D design and CGI is probably something you would gravitate towards because you just have this natural instinct towards objects.&#8221; And I was like okay cool. And so eventually, that relationship blossomed and he got a grant from NSF to create character animation and pedagogy for what they used to call multimedia back in the day. So this is basically like CD-ROMs and stuff. And so he just paid me for a summer to learn CGI. It was these silicone graphics machines that were down in a basement and no one that knew how to use them. They were built on Unix and he was like &#8220;Crack the code on these and learn how to create 3D avatars and animate them and there you go.&#8221; And so I literally again, it was sort of deja vu with the airbrush. Because the same thing I did was for the next three months I just holed away in that basement learning 3D. And then yeah, that started&#8230; That was my path of how does art relate to design?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Self taught.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So once you graduated from North Carolina State, what was the first design job that you had?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
First design job was at this game company called Interactive Magic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
And they were known for this flight simulation game called Apache and it was just&#8230; Apaches are these huge helicopters in the military. I think it&#8217;s like&#8230; Well, I don&#8217;t know, one of the most feared or destructive helicopters in the arsenal or whatever. So we played that up in the game and basically you got the experience of flying an Apache helicopter but we also did first person shooters and a couple other things as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And now as I was looking through your extensive LinkedIn resume, I saw that you were a product design lead at IBM for five years and this was back during a time when product design certainly wasn&#8217;t as widespread as it is now in the industry. I&#8217;m curious to know, what did you take away from that experience?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Oh man, that was foundational as well. I was fortunate enough to have Chris Paul as a manager coming out of the Interactive Magic. He recruited me into the team within a year I was already managing folks just because he just believed in my capability. So not only was I learning product design at a very early time but then also learning how to manage people and so forth early in my career. Yeah, it was a pretty cool time. I was working on WebSphere, which is like a enterprise web development IDE. Yeah and a couple other projects there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
One thing that I saw recently, I was reading through, I think it was FastCompany. I was reading through and they were talking about this study. I don&#8217;t know, you probably might&#8217;ve read this, the study from McKinsey about CEOs and design leadership. Do you know what I&#8217;m talking about?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yes&#8230;yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you probably know where I&#8217;m going with this. So you&#8217;ve held down a lot of design leadership positions at a number of different companies and agencies. I mean we&#8217;ve mentioned IBM, of course you&#8217;re now at Airbnb but I mean, Adobe, Amazon, Microsoft, RGA. That&#8217;s a huge swath of experience there. And to sort of refer back to this study, the study basically was saying that CEOs don&#8217;t understand design leadership at all. When you look back at your career, have you found that to be the case?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I think there&#8217;s been a progression. I wouldn&#8217;t say where we&#8217;ve reached the Nirvana yet but there has been a progression. And I could describe my early career as trying to get a seat at the table as a designer. And then as a team lead trying to get your team to have a seat at the table. You&#8217;re the voice of your team, at the seat of the table. And then human centered design and design thinking. Being the voice of the customer and having the customer have a seat at the table. Table being like executive forums, decision making forums and so forth. And then I think now, if you&#8217;re fortunate enough to be in a successful company, most likely there&#8217;s some notion of design as a strategic asset in there.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I think the extent to which that&#8217;s true probably varies. But yeah, I think we&#8217;ve grown. At the same time, I think designers as leaders are very rare. And I think at the point of my career that I&#8217;m in now, what spoke to me quite a bit, getting back to Airbnb a bit is the fact that the founder, two of the three founders are university grads and Brian and I have a good rapport. Brian Chesky is like a designer&#8217;s designer if anything. He leads the whole company as CEO. And the way to approach problems that we learned very early on as designers is just thematic in how Airbnb just runs in general. And I find that fascinating.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you just dropped a little something there I want to go back to. You said that designers as leaders are rare. Can you unpack that a little bit? What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, designers as business leaders.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Are rare. Yeah. I think there are very few CEOs with design backgrounds. Typically even at the executive levels, design reports into engineering. Typically there&#8217;s very little design organizations that end at CEO level or report into sort of a C level position. Again, that&#8217;s just representation, that&#8217;s sort of quote unquote, seat at the table. So I just find that interesting. I think that at a certain level, we plateau a bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What do you think would need to happen to change that?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I think that design&#8230; Approaching design with a business lens without sacrificing the ability to be creative is one way to do that. I think there&#8217;s a balance to be had there. But understanding and even building this into design curriculums at a early phase in people&#8217;s development is key. Like how did decisions get made in business? And how can design play a part not only in what&#8217;s delivered but how it&#8217;s delivered and why it&#8217;s delivered? In relation to the business and the reason why the company even exists.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Given your design leadership positions, have you found that designers are starting to come more into that business sense as the years go on? Are they improving, I guess? That&#8217;s probably a better way to put it.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I think that design has just&#8230; It&#8217;s been democratized by technology a lot more. So I think when we bring folks in with varied backgrounds, so folks just out of undergrad while they were going to school or even not attending undergrad, that have had their own brand agencies or have been contracting and understand-</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Agencies or have been contracting and understand business at a level of basically putting the food on the table. I think it enables them to have the same, a different level of rigor in terms of how they impact decisions at work as ICs or even managers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I&#8217;m curious about that, because I feel like certainly as technology has made it so more and more people can enter into design at pretty much any level. In a way it sort of forced some people to be almost more entrepreneurial and more businesslike in their design, because they may not necessarily be doing it for a business, but they have X number of clients. Say if they do a bunch of design for a marketplace website or something like that, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m thinking like 99designs or something to that effect where they didn&#8217;t have to kind of talk to a number of different clients and weigh the business cases and not just creates for the sake of creation I guess.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. Even just bringing it back to my own story of having an airbrush business and understanding clients and briefs and however crazy they were either in high school or sort of like, &#8220;Hey, just hook me up with a T-shirt with the Wu-Tang Clan symbol on or whatever. But you still need to understand like, &#8220;Okay, what is this person&#8217;s sensibility and what are you&#8217;re trying to do with?&#8221; It&#8217;s basically what this person&#8217;s brand is. That enables a different level of &#8230; A different way of seeing the world when you hit the corporate or agency roadmap.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So you&#8217;ve been now at Airbnb, we spoke about this before recording. You&#8217;ve been there for about seven or so months now. What lessons did you learn this past year? How has this new experience improved you or has it helped? How has it helped you grow?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been for me just refreshing to be in a company where creativity and design is an extreme asset. I mean, I think I probably took that for granted earlier in my career working with Nike at RJ and just being in sort of an agency for so long of like, your purpose or what you believe in intersecting or overlapping with your talent or kind of capability as a designer. And so I didn&#8217;t understand how rare that was until after I left RJ and wasn&#8217;t working on Nike.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
And I think now, I&#8217;ve worked with a lot of companies that have great missions, but being at Airbnb, it reminds me of early in my career where it&#8217;s just like a lot of people believing in something, a lot of people with extreme amounts of talent. And I think that belief mixed with the level of creativity and talent that&#8217;s cultivated here is just, it&#8217;s one the things that just it&#8217;s really refreshing and it&#8217;s a delight to be here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. When you look back over your career at all the places you&#8217;ve worked at, what are some of the biggest lessons that you&#8217;ve learned?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
The biggest lessons I&#8217;ve learned I think is that in some ways I think creativity in terms of design is an act of kindness. What draws me to design the most is when that&#8217;s quantified and calibrated against. What I&#8217;m saying is, I think that creativity by itself is an inservice of something. Creating a better world or impacting people&#8217;s lives in a positive way can start to feel a little self-indulgent. But I think a mission like empowering every person on the planet to achieve more. When you mix that with creativity, there&#8217;s kindness involved in that. I think a mission like anyone feeling like they belong anywhere, there&#8217;s a notion of kindness in that. And design in the right circumstances can impact people&#8217;s lives if people are committed to it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does success look like for you now?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
For me it is just authentically committing to a purpose and kind of propagating that commitment among team members. So attracting people to that mission, fueling that mission, and then delivering on that mission, which is basically our products and our innovation. So I think success is all about understanding that purpose and just being a catalyst for belonging at this point.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I know just started at Airbnb not too long ago, but I&#8217;m curious, are you happy kind of with your current work-life balance? Is it good?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Work-life balance is interesting because I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know if I create a binary between the two.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d necessarily say it&#8217;s a binary, I guess think of it more like a see-saw. Like the balance is where you feel it&#8217;s the most balanced, so it&#8217;s not necessarily taking one from the other. And I&#8217;m curious, if it&#8217;s not balanced, what would that look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
So I have a two-year-old now, which is a new thing that&#8217;s very inspiring as well, and a five-month-old.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Thanks a lot. So I think I&#8217;m happier in my career, just in terms of where I am and the people I&#8217;m working with. I think so that makes me a better spouse, better father and so forth. I think in doing that, the balance is, I think when you&#8217;re passionate about something, you&#8217;re compelled to do it quite a bit and go above and beyond. So it&#8217;s like how do you calibrate against responsibilities as a new father while still stimulating yourself and improving yourself? And just along that, is it just being on a journey of an improvement as a person and then, how does your career fit into that as well? Let&#8217;s that being a new father, those are some new variables that I hadn&#8217;t had to deal with before.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What keeps you motivated and inspired these days? I mean, aside from your kids, I would imagine.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, kids definitely. I would say that&#8217;s probably number one. I mean, without being cliched, you see that everything is new in their eyes. You see everything that comes in comes out in some way. You see a reflection of yourself, both the best parts of yourself and sometimes the worst parts. So that&#8217;s definitely an area of inspiration. I read sci-fi, I&#8217;m a sci-fi fanatic. I love Octavia Butler. So I read her stuff a lot. I think mainly it&#8217;s a combination of fashion, sci-fi, and just being enamored with my kids is probably the biggest inspiration for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, I heard you are quite the sneakerhead too. Somebody told me that. I mean, you let me know if I&#8217;m wrong there, but.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, I have a big, large collection of shoes from my days working with Nike and I feel like I&#8217;m a reformed sneakerhead a bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is that possible?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I think I probably have way &#8230; I don&#8217;t know, but I don&#8217;t have as many as before. And so I have just a few, a smaller inventory than I did before. But I try to make them count.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Like a nice warehouse set aside for them.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, [crosstalk 00:35:38].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Climate control. Do you feel like you&#8217;re living your life&#8217;s purpose right now or do you think you&#8217;re still searching for it?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Oh wow. That&#8217;s deep Maurice. Yeah, at times I do feel like that&#8217;s the case. I love what I&#8217;m doing right now in terms of purpose. I love how it&#8217;s being directed and delivered. I love the impact that I have on people&#8217;s lives, or the impact I want to have on people&#8217;s lives. And yeah, it&#8217;s cool to be a new father. And so there&#8217;s a lot of things that are in line right now. So yeah, I hadn&#8217;t really thought about it like that, but yeah, I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m starting to live my purpose.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything that you haven&#8217;t done yet that you want to do? This can be career-wise. It can be life-wise, anything in particular?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I&#8217;d want to learn how to fly, fly planes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, for one of my recent birthdays, my wife got me flying lessons and it was pretty amazing. So I just started, but I haven&#8217;t been able to keep it going. But yeah, I&#8217;d love to just be I guess a novice pilot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. I feel like we&#8217;ve had someone on the show that was a pilot. Well I don&#8217;t know if they were a pilot. I think they were just into flying planes, like model planes. I&#8217;m thinking of Dantley Davis. I don&#8217;t remember if he told me he was into planes or if he did fly recreationally. I don&#8217;t remember which it was. But I would imagine that&#8217;s probably pretty well within your grasp right now?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean it&#8217;s just amazing to be up there and how you feel when you&#8217;re actually in control of the plane, how complex it is. But in some ways it&#8217;s fairly simple as well. Just seems like extremely challenging but very peaceful at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Will probably make your commute easier.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Oh indeed, yeah. Going from Seattle to San Francisco man, you wouldn&#8217;t talk about work-life balance. That&#8217;s one thing that&#8217;s off balance is like, how can I make that commute less painful? So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How far is it? I mean, I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;re flying, but it&#8217;s what, like a two hour flight?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. Sometimes a little less. And then yeah, I&#8217;m trying to make it a science to get in and out of the airport and to the office as quick as possible so I can get my day started at 10:00 AM starting from Seattle, which isn&#8217;t too bad.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. See Airbnb needs to work on the air part. They got the bnb part down.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They get the air part down, get you a private jet or something back and forth. Make it happen.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
There you go. I like the way you&#8217;re thinking Maurice. We should have a transportation division as well. I got to hit them up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, so what is it like, I&#8217;m curious because Seattle is a pretty big tech city. I mean Microsoft is there, Amazon is there, and Nintendo is there, bunch of other probably smaller companies and stuff, but you&#8217;re working in Silicon Valley. Do you feel like that&#8217;s a big shift for you in any sort of way?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
For me personally, no. I mean we have an office, Airbnb has an office in Seattle as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. So there&#8217;s a office here and so I work out of the Seattle office as well as the San Francisco office. So we&#8217;re quite a community here in Seattle. And I think what&#8217;s interesting, really interesting in terms of the black design community here, woman by the name of Bekah Marcum has just recently just used LinkedIn to literally just knit together a community out of thin air over the last couple of years of black designers in Seattle. I just spoke at one of the events not too long ago, but being a part of the design community just at large in Seattle, it&#8217;s great. And like you said, there&#8217;s a ton of tech companies here. There&#8217;s a ton of agencies here as well. This is a nice creative climate.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Talk to me more about that local Seattle design scene. Black design scene I guess if we want to put a finer point on it. What is it like for you at this stage in your career?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I like to be closer probably to the black design community or design committee in general. So fairly busy. But yeah, just being able to meet with young early in career designers and folks who&#8217;ve been in the game for a while as well is just super interesting. I mean, iron sharpens iron and sometimes it&#8217;s just representation, like this being in a room of people that look like you, especially when that&#8217;s not often the case is cathartic in and of itself. And if all those people are also within your function and are passionate about what you&#8217;re passionate about as well, it&#8217;s like paradise.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s something that I found interesting when I started doing live shows with Revision Path is that oftentimes just the fellowship aspect alone of being in the same room, like for attendees, for me too really. Just being in the same room with a bunch of black designers, I don&#8217;t want to say that&#8217;s enough. It feels like a disservice to say that&#8217;s enough given sort of the dearth of spaces that are available in the design community that speak to us, that are for us, that cater to us, et cetera. But just being in the space, every time we do a live show, people are like, &#8220;When&#8217;s the next one?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Ah, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; But they love that opportunity so much and they&#8217;re able to talk to people that look like them, that are in the same field as them. It&#8217;s such a rarity when it does happen.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Oh my God yeah. It&#8217;s so rare. I mean basically we couldn&#8217;t stop talking about it. After we finished up with the event, people were just constantly remarking about how rare this is and how good it feels. And yeah, I mean just like you said, it just speaks the dearth of opportunities, places, times when we are together. And so we&#8217;ve got a long way to go in our industry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you&#8217;ve been a design leader in this industry for a long time. You&#8217;ve seen designers come and go, you&#8217;ve seen trends come and go, et cetera. What is something that you&#8217;ve &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Seeing trends come and go, et cetera. What is something that you think most designers don&#8217;t worry about but they should? I have an answer. I don&#8217;t want to seed your answer but I want to listen to what you have to say.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I would say the why, I think the more senior you get, the more experienced you get, it gets better. But I&#8217;ve even seen more senior designers not really understand why they&#8217;re making decisions and be able to articulate the rationale behind it. And it goes back to just art versus design. We&#8217;re not artists necessarily. We should be artists, but our job isn&#8217;t art, as a designer at least. You are solving problems, so understanding how to articulate why you&#8217;ve made a decision, down to every design decision. Even some of the design decisions you&#8217;re probably making intuitively or instinctually, I&#8217;d love to see designers focus more on that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That was actually pretty close to my answer. Yeah, I was going to say writing, but for the very same reasons of being able to articulate sort of why you made a certain design decision or why you decided to go a certain way. I mean look, I&#8217;m a designer that can sit out and vibe for hours over fonts and find what the right typeface is to get a vibe and all that. But being able to articulate the why behind it is so important because otherwise people just think you&#8217;re some woo woo hippie designer just pulling stuff out of nowhere. And it&#8217;s like where is &#8230; what&#8217;s the rationale behind it? What&#8217;s the thought process that goes into the decision? Because it feels like without that then yeah, you are an artist because artists don&#8217;t necessarily have to explain that. But as a designer you&#8217;re in service to the user, to the company, to the client, et cetera. So that rationale becomes paramount.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah, I couldn&#8217;t describe it better. I think &#8230; and then as you rise in seniority, you have this whole notion of accountability. So as you define that, you either create accountability because of those decisions or you&#8217;re given accountability because of those decisions. And if you don&#8217;t understand what you&#8217;re being held accountable for, you can&#8217;t measure it, you can&#8217;t tout it, you can&#8217;t &#8230; When calibration performance reviews come around, you&#8217;re sort of like, well I did this, but why did you do it? How does that track against the business impact? Can you make a &#8230; I think there&#8217;s several ways to use that as ammunition and one of them is through performance reviews. I also see that as an area where writing and everything we&#8217;re talking about comes in handy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What advice would you give to, let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m a mid career designer, I&#8217;m even loath to use that term because the middle of a designer&#8217;s career, it&#8217;s often a very weird nebulous period of time. You know what I mean? I mean certainly if you look at titles, you can be a junior or senior whatever, but mid career, is that three years, five years, 10 years? How long is a designer&#8217;s career, et cetera. But let&#8217;s say a mid career designer, say five years or so in the game, they&#8217;re listening to this interview, they&#8217;re looking at your work, they&#8217;re looking at your resume. What advice would you give them if they want to get to the level where you are?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Sometimes I&#8217;m a little old school, I don&#8217;t even know if this really still applies, I haven&#8217;t thought about it as much, but when I was coming up and it was again, my father&#8217;s influence, he had the whole adage of you got to be twice as good. He didn&#8217;t really necessarily add the whole expect half as much thing. He just &#8230; they definitely instilled that, understand where the bar is and then just double it. So I&#8217;d say craft and just excellence. If you can just be as scary talented as you can be, I think that starts to speak for itself. And also it reflects your passion, whether that is interaction or XD or communication design, visual design, graphic design, whatever it is. Even gathering insights, just that notion of excellence and understanding where the bar is and always trying to push it is a gift.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So one of the things that we have for this year, for 2020 is basically a more equitable future. I mean 2020 is sort of this year that&#8217;s been driven into pop culture as the future in many ways, whether it&#8217;s the new show or just the notion of a repeating year of some sort where this is the future. How are you helping to use your design skills or even just kind of your station at where you&#8217;re at in life, how are you helping to create a more equitable future?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
One of the things we just started to do is to work with companies, like the Inneract Project, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with the other Maurice Mo and even beyond that how can you create more awareness of design as a viable path. Not only viable but extremely lucrative in some cases, path as well, to underrepresented marginalized groups. I think that&#8217;s key. I think for me, in terms of contributing to a more equitable industry and talent pool, it&#8217;s just like getting folks in and then understanding the barriers there. I mean it&#8217;s not just social economic but it&#8217;s also cultural. I think we talked about my background where my parents were very supportive of art just as a means to &#8230; as a way of living but that&#8217;s definitely not always the case. You see that all the time.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
So overcoming those barriers, so awareness. I think access is another one. And then also just tilling the soil as it were, as a leader myself in propagating the understanding of representation, diversity and having a diverse population feel like they belong as well and how that puts jet fuel on creativity. There&#8217;s tons of research on it, I won&#8217;t go into all that, but it&#8217;s tangible what happens when you get a bunch of different voices singing the same song.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? It&#8217;s 2025, it&#8217;s even further in the future, what is Tim Allen doing? What&#8217;s he working on?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Oh man. 2025 in the future, I&#8217;m probably a host of some sort. Either a super host, in terms of an experience or my home or both. I&#8217;m working on that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Oh, an Airbnb host. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know why my mind went straight to game show when you said that, but okay.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
I could be a game show host. That could be interesting too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hey, nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Yeah. No, I feel like I would want in five years to be &#8230; to have provided some pathway of access to increase our numbers as black designers in the field. Definitely within Airbnb. But not only us racially but numbers of other underrepresented populations as well. Just being a beacon of inclusion and belonging. Yeah, I think if in five years, somehow in the orbit of what it means to create a creative team or produce creative deliverables that are inclusive and that inspire people to want to be more inclusive and host and make people feel like they belong. That&#8217;s what I would want to do in five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
You can definitely check me out on Twitter, Tim Allen Design. Hit me up on Instagram as well. I&#8217;m just Timothy Allen there. LinkedIn is always a good route too. I&#8217;ve got a couple of portfolios out there, but they&#8217;re super old. So take a look at those if you want to, but just to kind of see my path and some old work like-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Any of the airbrush shirts up there?</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
No, I need to put some of those up there though.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You should, I feel like that&#8217;s making a comeback now. Fashion design comes in 20 year cycles.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
True, true, true. And we&#8217;re &#8230; that would be right for right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hey look, think about it.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Okay [inaudible 00:08:44].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right Tim Allen, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you for, one, giving us kind of a peek behind the curtain at Airbnb, what it&#8217;s like to kind of be at your position, but also just talking about your path, your journey as a designer, how you&#8217;ve come up and also really, I think it&#8217;s good to have that sort of introspection once you get to a &#8230; I don&#8217;t know, I think once you get to a certain level in your career to kind of see this is where I&#8217;ve been, this is where I&#8217;m going.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s always good, I feel like to have those sorts of insights and reflective moments because not only does it help you out and help you grow as a person, but also it helps out others as well because you&#8217;re able to kind of impart that knowledge on the next generation and certainly it looks like with the work you&#8217;re doing at Airbnb, through your teams as well as this work that you&#8217;re talking about with the black designer community in Seattle, et cetera, that you&#8217;re making that happen. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Tim Allen:</b><br>
Thanks for having me, Maurice. I appreciate it. It&#8217;s been a pleasure.</p>

<p>I first heard of Billy Almon at last year&#8217;s Black in Design Conference, and I was so energized by his talk that I knew I would have to have him on the podcast to share his story with you all. Being a biology-inspired storyteller and designer might sound a bit peculiar, but wait until you hear how vital and important his work is to all of us.</p>
<p>Billy started off with a primer on biomimicry, and then shared how his experience with Hurricane Katrina changed the course of his life forever. We also talked about the value of exposure, and the creation of <a href="https://www.billybiology.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Billy Biology</a>, his way of giving back to the world and inspiring generations to come about how biomimicry and design are so important. According to Billy, &#8220;the answers are all around us.&#8221; And I think after this interview, we should be ready for them!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are, and what you do?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
My name is Billy Almon, and I am a biology inspired storyteller and designer. So, I look at organisms in nature, I get an understanding of how they innovate, how they have been innovative, and I look for opportunities to apply that to challenges at the human scale.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Now, I regret to say, I first heard about you last year, at the Black and design conference that goes on at Harvard Graduate School of Design. You were on this panel, actually, with two other people who&#8217;ve been on the show, Ari Melenciano and Jerome Harris. Yeah, I know the panel was about equity and justice in technology and media. I remember you gave this example about a slime mold that I thought &#8230; I was sitting in the back like, &#8220;Wow, that is really dope.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How had you heard about the event before you spoke there?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
I&#8217;d been trying to go to the event, I&#8217;d been trying to attend the event since the first conference. My wife actually told me about an opportunity when they started looking for speakers for the last conference, so she actually reached out to them and said, &#8220;Hey, you might want to check out this guy named Billy Almon, he might be good for your conference.&#8221; Then, they reached out to me with an inquiry about participating.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Yeah, I mentioned before we started recording how your wife, she reached out to me too, years and years ago, about starting a podcast. That&#8217;s dope that she&#8217;s been proactive in helping out like that.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Man, she&#8217;s the most self actualized person I&#8217;ve ever met. It does wonders for my career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I read where you refer to yourself as a biomimicry advocate and practitioner. Of course, I have to ask, I feel like you probably get asked this on every podcast but, what is biomimicry, and how do you use it in your life?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Biomimicry comes from this term called biomimesis, which translates to imitate life. Essentially, it&#8217;s the idea of turning to nature for inspiration on how to solve problems. If you think about the world in which we live in, every single organism on this planet, whether it be human, or bacteria, or mammals, all of us have to deal with the same conditions. Sunlight, cyclical processes, ebbs and flows in resources, competition, environmental factors that play into how we live our lives.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
So, when you think about the fact that we all experience these things, and when you think about the fact that a lot of these organisms have been around longer than we have, you start to see that there&#8217;s all of these existing methods and strategies for solving problems, that exist in the natural world. What biomimicry does is we study these organisms, and then we find the underlying tactic, or strategy, or function that&#8217;s at play, at how these organisms are solving their problems, and then we apply that to parallel problems that humans face.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
To give you an example, Velcro is an example of the biomemetic process at play. The designer of Velcro, he was a Swiss gentleman who would take his dog for walks. Every time that he would come home, he would find these little spherical seeds attached to the fur of his dog. So, he took these seeds under his microscope, and saw that there was these curly little hooks on the end of each strand of this seed, and he realized that this is a great way that this seeds attaches to animals, these curly little hooks. That became the inspiration for Velcro. So, if you think about how Velcro looks, when you look at it up close, it&#8217;s all of these little strands, and curly strings on one side, with fur-ish counterpart on the other, so Velcro came from the strategy of this seed, which is called a burr seed, to attach to animals, in order to have the animals carry the seeds to locations where they might potentially grow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, interesting. Yeah, I&#8217;ve heard something about that, with Velcro and how now, I guess there&#8217;s different types of Velcro, where the matting isn&#8217;t as plush, or the hooks aren&#8217;t as deep, but it is still based off of that same premise, of what you&#8217;ve seen in nature. You&#8217;re now able to recreate that, in an industrial setting.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Given that example, I feel like that&#8217;s something we probably, as kids just running around in fields and stuff, have instinctively picked up. You run around, and you&#8217;ve got grass and all kind of stuff stuck to your pants, and your shirt, your hair, or anything like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you first learn about biomimicry? When did you first know that this was something that you were into?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
I actually came across biomimicry as a result of Hurricane Katrina. By that, I mean after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, I was an architecture student at Howard University at the time. After the storm hit, and after the manmade disaster that followed, there was a lot of students, obviously not only at Howard, but around the world &#8230; At Howard, there were a lot of students who wanted to do something. How can we help?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
About 500 students from Howard University drove down to New Orleans, and to the Gulf Coast, to just find ways to volunteer to help during our Spring Break. Seeing what took place up close, I had the most transformative experience. It was the most transformative experience I&#8217;ve ever had, just witnessing people who look like you, people who look like me, in the conditions that that disaster left that community. As an architecture student I was curious, how do we avoid this from happening? How do we create spaces in communities where this event is not taking place? Especially knowing that climate change is not going way, especially coastal cities, and people in low income neighborhoods are going to be the most affected, and are the most affected by climate change, how do we prevent these kinds of things from happening again?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
In trying to find answers to that question, I came across this book called Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature, which was written by a woman named Janine Benyus. After I read that, everything for me changed, it became my design philosophy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. So, once you learned &#8230; Well, hold on. Actually, let me switch gears for a little bit. You mentioned climate change. Here in Atlanta, we have a Museum of Design here, and 2020 the theme that they have for this year is that it&#8217;s the year of climate and change. Actually, by the time this episode airs, there will actually be an exhibit there, about biomimicry. It&#8217;s titled Learning from Nature: The Future of Design, it was developed in collaboration with the Biomimicry Institute.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m really interested in checking that out, because I heard about that right around the same time that I was at Black and Design. I was like, &#8220;I need to learn more about this,&#8221; because the examples that you were giving during that panel talk really inspired me to think about, what are ways that designers could possibly use nature for design, for technology, for creating more equitable futures? Which we&#8217;ll get to, later on in the conversation, but I wanted to mention that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, let&#8217;s switch gears here a bit, because you talked about Howard University. I want to go back, a little bit further than that. Where did you grow up?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
I was a military brat growing up. My dad was in the Army, and my mom worked for the Department of Defense. So, I was born in Germany, I think we moved back to the States when I was, I want to say, one? Maybe two. Bounced around several states, Texas, lived in Georgia a little bit, lived in Maryland, before I went to Howard. Lived in South Korea, and then back to Germany. So, just all over the place, which was a fun experience, especially when you get to come across kids who have friends that they&#8217;ve known since they were in diapers. I have a new best friend every two years, so that was always a fun experience, growing up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
With all of that traveling, and seeing the country, seeing the world, how did that shape you, creatively?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Oh man, it made everything possible. It told me that there&#8217;s more options than I think, right away. It added all these different flavors to the mix of how you can create something new, by just introducing a new, or a different perspective, on what you&#8217;re trying to do. Does that make sense?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that makes sense because it&#8217;s sort of like that adage, &#8220;You can&#8217;t be what you don&#8217;t see.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, the fact that you&#8217;re able to see all of these different experiences, different people, different cultures, et cetera, that all feeds into who you are.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;ve got to tell you, if there was one thing that really stuck out to me, about the experience of all that traveling as a young kid, was just the value of exposure. I mean, like you say, you don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know. Once you&#8217;re exposed to something, it just reintroduces you to another level of possibilities, right? I can&#8217;t emphasize enough how much exposure, even in a lot of the work that I&#8217;m doing now, how big of a role that plays.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you first know that design, in general, was something that you were really interested in? Were you just prone to it as a kid, or how&#8217;d you find out about it?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
When I was a kid, these are the stories my mom would tell me, about me being in my room, building contraptions, building booby traps in my room, and building cities out of construction paper and Legos. So, my mom would always tell me when I was a kid that I was going to be either an engineer, or an inventor when I grew up. Just her telling me that I was like, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s the name of it,&#8221; and I&#8217;d just go back to playing in my room.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Finding ways to explore my imagination, I think that was really it. Then, her just feeding that was a big part of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember when I was a kid, they used to have this, I think it was a contest, called Invent America. Do you remember this?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
No. What was that?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I might be showing my age. When I was in school in the &#8217;80s, Jesus Christ, there was this nationwide competition called Invent America, and it was for K through eight students to, basically, creative thinking skills, critical thinking skills, et cetera. You just basically made stuff, and it was a nationwide competition, they judged it. I don&#8217;t know if Invent America is still a thing, anymore? I want to say, given the state that America is now, not to be political, but I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s still a thing that kids do?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Was that at a public school they did that?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it was a public school. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Oh man, maybe I was in Korea.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
This is a public school in rural Alabama.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Oh, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I figured it was a nationwide thing, I thought it was nationwide. I&#8217;m going to have to look into that.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
You know what&#8217;s funny? When you said Invent for America, my mind went to us. What was it, reach for-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Hands Across America. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
I was like, &#8220;Wait, you did what?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I need to see if Invent America&#8217;s still a thing, because &#8230; It&#8217;s funny, I think about the stuff that I did when I was younger in school, and how completely unorthodox I think it is, right now. We had a critical thinking &#8230; Not a class, really, but they would give us critical thinking exercises. They&#8217;d give us an odd scrap of construction paper, or something, and everyone gets the same shape of construction paper, and you have to basically make something out of it. Some people would glue it to a piece of paper, and draw around it to make art around it. Or, someone would take it, and fold it into something, or things like that. I don&#8217;t know if kids have that kind of stuff, now?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
You know what&#8217;s crazy about that? Now, to do that, you&#8217;d have to pay $20,000 a semester at college, to do the exact same thing. Take this piece of paper.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
I remember, one of our projects was we had to take one piece of cardboard, and turn it into a chair, and be able to sit in the chair. It was basically just a thicker piece of paper, I could have just went to public school in Alabama, and checked that box.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, you have this, I guess, childhood curiosity for creating these traps, and buildings, and everything, so your parents saw that as something that, clearly, you were into. Was that what influenced you to go into architecture?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yes, when it came time-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was that what influenced you to go into architecture?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yes. When it came time for me to start looking at schools and start thinking about my major, the closest thing, at that time, that I came across was architecture. I was looking at it like, &#8220;What is something that has to deal with psychology, has to deal with politics, has to deal with science and art?&#8221; This is 2004, so this is before everyone just was Googling stuff. Before that was a trend, it was&#8230; What was it? Hotmail and looking stuff up on that internet. Architecture was the first thing that I came across and understanding, researching about Egyptian architecture and how the architect was treated in society during that time period really kind of romanticized it in a way where I was like, &#8220;Okay. This feels like the right thing.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How was your time at Howard?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
I wouldn&#8217;t trade my Howard experience for anything. It was the best in so many different ways. One, because that was my first taste of Wakanda, and if you recall from the talk, but I just love black Panther. In part, because you can see biomemetic elements in the design. It was the first time, I remember stepping on campus like it was yesterday, stepping on campus and just seeing beautiful, intelligent people having diverse conversations and they all look like you, right? Just not getting that flavor, again, having traveled the world and primarily being the minority everywhere I went, it was just such a unique and special experience that, I just&#8230; Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Was it your choice to go through an HBCU or was that something your parents were pushing?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
No, it&#8217;s interesting. I had actually planned to go to the University of Maryland and then I got accepted into Howard. I remember, I don&#8217;t know how not political or spiritual to not get, but this is literally what happened. I was praying about the decision like what do I do? And literally, I heard the clearest, as clear as I&#8217;m talking to you, something was just telling me, &#8220;Go to Howard.&#8221; Now, literally talking to you, I can totally see how just following that voice just turned into the beautiful life that I have now, especially because I got to meet my wife there. I think that&#8217;s probably the main reason anyone should go to Howard. I&#8217;m kidding. But so many great blessings came out of that just, I will always cherish it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. We&#8217;ve had several Howard alums here on the show too. I&#8217;m sure they would all agree as well. It&#8217;s a great school.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious though about this connection between architecture and what you&#8217;re doing now. So you go through Howard, you&#8217;re studying architecture, you graduate with your degree, and now this is 10 plus years later, the work that you&#8217;re doing is in biology and design? That&#8217;s quite a path to take.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah. Coming out of school, I got an opportunity to participate in a competition that Disney has called the Imaginations Competition. Out of that, I got an internship. Myself and four other Howard students, we entered this competition, submitted a design proposal for something we thought Disney should create, something we thought would be a cool Disney experience. Out of that, I got an internship and my first internship was literally, we were given a stack of things that were being worked on in the R&#038;D department. They said, &#8220;Come up with new experiences for the future based on these cool cutting edge things we&#8217;re working on.&#8221; That was literally my first internship.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Long story short, after that, for 10 years after that, I worked at Disney in a lot of different capacities. My roles and responsibilities kind of changed to more, not just architectural design, but design of experiences and products and kind of a lot of really kind of forward future thinking. When you&#8217;re studying these things and when you&#8217;re looking at the future and all of that, you&#8217;re very often looking at the past. Again, for me, the natural world was full of all of these amazing innovative strategies. It naturally became something that I kind of just applied to everything that I was working on.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
The other thing was my mother growing up, she loved animals and my mom is, God rest her soul, my hero. She&#8217;d always have stuffed animals on her desk at work and we always loved to be outdoors. That&#8217;s another thing that kind of just really stuck with me over time. Then when I got the chance to kind of dive deeper into biology and kind of studying how all these amazing creatures do things, it just blew my mind and really opened up this whole new avenue of resources for looking at innovation and design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So then later on, you end up going to grad school. You went to Arizona State to study this kind of further. You studied biomimicry there.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I was like, &#8220;Man,&#8221; as much as I loved Howard, I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m never doing college again. I&#8217;m good.&#8221; Then over time, I was just kind of thinking like, &#8220;Okay, if I wanted to continue my education, it&#8217;d either be an MBA or be something else.&#8221; Then I realized that there was an opportunity to get a master&#8217;s of science degree in biomimicry. And I was like, &#8220;Okay, I have to keep going with this,&#8221; and that just further blew my mind and really kind of just opened up the natural world to.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What was your time like there studying this now professionally? I would imagine that probably was a big shock in a way, right?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah. One of the cool things about the program was I was also participating in an additional smaller cohort program where we traveled around the world to six different locations where we were immersed for a week in all these different ecosystems. We were literally in these amazing environments; costa Rica, Hawaii, the Sonoran desert in Arizona, the Colorado Rockies. We&#8217;re in these environments. We&#8217;re camping out. We&#8217;re looking at slug and you know, lichen and mushrooms and, and we&#8217;re understanding how, not only do they solve problems within their context and within the kind of operating conditions that they have to thrive within, but we&#8217;re also seeing how they relate to each other and how there&#8217;s so much cooperation in the natural world when most people just think it&#8217;s all about competition.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, survival of the fittest.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah. So the interesting thing about that to me is how out of context that phrase is thrown around when that whole idea of survival of the fittest is really not necessarily the strongest organism or animal, but the one that&#8217;s most fit to the conditions to really thrive within that niche. It just completely reframes it in a different way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It makes it then, more relational and environmental and not necessarily strength-based or some sort of adversarial kind of concept?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah. It makes it more about there&#8217;s a place where everything has its most optimal self.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
You don&#8217;t have to be the strongest. Sometimes you need to be the weakest and the smallest because in this environment, to be small is to be optimal. Right? So it&#8217;s more about context than it is some sense of bravado, for lack of a better word.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. How did Billy Biology come about?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Oh man, so it&#8217;s funny. It started kind of, I don&#8217;t want to say as a joke, but my background wasn&#8217;t in biology, but I would be around a lot of biologists. For me, again, a brother in an environment where I&#8217;m the only one, when we&#8217;re hearing our teachers and our professors talk about these big biological, complex terms, I would kind of break it down for myself to understand, but kind of just blurt it out to the class. Basically, that&#8217;s where the poop comes out, right? They have all of these kind of like really, really complex terms about stuff and I would just kind of like break it down like that. It made it that much more digestible for my classmates. One day, we were in British Columbia and I had time to talk to my nephew, he was 10 at the time, and I was just asking him like, &#8220;So what do you want to do when you grow up?&#8221; His answer was, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m still thinking about it, but either a basketball player or a rapper.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
For me, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay. As your uncle, I support you if that&#8217;s really what you want to do,&#8221; but as a person who had the opportunity to work among the most creative, talented people at Disney and then travel the world and see all these amazing places, that showed me that this is more about me exposing him to the world that I get to have access to than it is about that potentially really being what he wanted to do. What I would start to do is every time that we would travel to these different places, I would shoot a little video of what I was learning and kind of in that vernacular that I use with my classmates of kind of understanding these biological principles. I would just upload it to Facebook so that he could see it and other people could see it.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
I got so much great feedback from not only from him, but also from like other people who saw the videos about how they were sharing it with their kids and how much it meant for them to see a person of color talking about science and technology and design. So it became a thing where I was like, &#8220;Okay, there&#8217;s something here and it&#8217;s resonating with people and there&#8217;s a need for it. So let me just keep going,&#8221; and it&#8217;s just kind of blossomed into other opportunities since.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And one of those opportunities being a television show.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You have a TV show called, &#8220;Little Giants.&#8221; Talk about that.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah. So that&#8217;s crazy. It&#8217;s crazy how it happened. A good friend of mine named Bradley Trevor Greive, who I had the opportunity to work with at Disney, he saw a lot of the videos and he and I, every now and then we get together and we&#8217;d go and watch bad movies and kind of complain about how bad they were and kind of put our cinephile hats on. He&#8217;s a wildlife author and just a really dope human being. So he hit me up one day and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, so I&#8217;m pitching a show to Animal Planet and I think it would be hilarious if you and I were the host of this thing.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;So I want to see if you&#8217;re interested in me throwing your name into the mix.&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Just want to be honest, it&#8217;s a long shot. We don&#8217;t know what&#8217;ll happened, but I just wanted to see if you&#8217;re interested.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, well, you know, it&#8217;s a long shot,&#8221; which means it&#8217;ll never happen. So I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, go ahead. Tell them all about me.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
So he hit me up maybe six months later and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey. So yeah, we&#8217;re doing this thing, man. The show got picked up. Are you still interested?&#8221; And I jumped at the opportunity. So the show, &#8220;Little Giants,&#8221; is myself and Bradley going out into remote places in the world around the world and finding tiny little creatures and highlighting some of the amazing adaptations and the amazing abilities, the amazing kind of super powers of these little creatures and then exploring, if we were to scale up this frog to the size of a beetle car&#8230; What are those cars called? Bug? [crosstalk 00:27:15]</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
A VW bugs. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. If we scale this frog up to the size of a bug, a VW bug, how strong would it actually be then? Or how high could it leap? And you get to see that transformation. So it&#8217;s really fun. It was an amazing opportunity and experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was going to say, that&#8217;s also like a huge platform to be able to talk about biomimicry and about your love for biology and everything. That&#8217;s truly something. The show is still&#8230; There&#8217;s still episodes on and everything, right? It&#8217;s still airing?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah. So I think six episodes have aired so far. You can find it on Animal Planet Go. I think more supposed to be rolling out. I can&#8217;t say the date, but I think there&#8217;s more on the way. I know we show more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
So hopefully, you guys will get a chance to see that soon.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ll make sure that we link to those episodes that you mentioned, link to them in the show notes. That&#8217;s really something to be able to take this love that you have to television that way. I feel like sort of what you&#8217;re saying about exposure, television feels like the ultimate exposure mechanism for people when they see like, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve got to show?&#8221; All the other work that you&#8217;ve done leading up to that of course is great, but you have a TV show [crosstalk 00:28:27] people get to watch. That means that it really spread your message far and wide. That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah, it was amazing. I consider myself a science communicator and it&#8217;s one thing to think that you&#8217;re doing a good job of briefly communicating a scientific or biological process, it&#8217;s a completely different thing when you&#8217;re doing it for television. Again, with my background in storytelling and the work that I did for Disney, I see myself as a storyteller too, but TV it&#8217;s such a different medium that having exposure to tell stories in that way was just another really cool thing that I&#8217;m hoping to expand on going forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I want to kind of change the topic here a little bit. I want to talk more about biomimicry kind of as it relates to design and creativity because you mentioned being a biology inspired storyteller and designer. For those that are listing, that are kind of interested in these examples that you&#8217;re mentioning, can you talk about what the benefit is of using biomimicry?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah, so if you think about it, there&#8217;s nothing that&#8217;s actually wasted in the natural world; the way that humans, the way that our design creates waste. The thing I love about the natural world and why I love studying biomimicry is nature is very entrepreneurial, meaning that things that live in nature, their goal is to thrive, grow, develop their community, protect their families while also expending as little energy as&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
&#8211; while also expending as little energy as possible, and so energy in the natural world is a primary resource. So organisms, whether it&#8217;s a vulture eating the scraps left from another animal hunting it, things are very entrepreneurial. They&#8217;re very much about how can I be as opportunistic as possible, and because of that, there&#8217;s no waste. You have decomposers, you have producers, you have this kind of cycle of organisms that find their niche and are also very resource efficient, and so because of that, you have a lot of sustainable strategies that you see in the natural world. So I can give you a couple of examples. There&#8217;s this one company called Sharklet and they produce &#8230; they&#8217;ve invented this kind of film that mimics the texture of sharkskin. The reason that they do that is because shark skin is covered in these very tiny, sharp little triangular looking teeth.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
And these teeth on the surface of a shark actually prevent microbes from collecting on the skin and the sharks getting bacteria and infections, and it&#8217;s antimicrobial, and so this company developed this film that replicates and imitates that pattern and it&#8217;s an antimicrobial surface. So now you have an invention that doesn&#8217;t require harsh chemicals for cleaning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
And I think that&#8217;s the real appeal of biomimicry is there&#8217;s so many different ways to derive inspiration from nature when you look at the process, because you&#8217;re studying the functions. So you&#8217;re studying, why does this form allow this beetle to fly at this rate and be that aerodynamic, but not only just the forms, you&#8217;re also studying the process of how these organisms solve problems, and you&#8217;re also looking at how, from a systems level, how all of these different organisms might be interacting with each other to develop more efficient and innovative processes.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
So just to give you another example, one of the things that I&#8217;m studying now is how super organisms, things like ants, colonies of ants or bees or schools of fish. How these individual organisms work together as a collective to accomplish a task and what their strategy and how they approach accomplishing a task can be applied to a business organization. So there&#8217;s all of these really, really cool, amazing things that when you break down nature to its kind of its most basic principles. There&#8217;s design principles at play in the tactics and the strategies that animals use and that their biology use that we can apply as designers to architecture, to engineering, to manufacturing, to sustainability, and with the talk that I was giving even to social challenges, I believe there&#8217;s potential for that as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, we&#8217;re definitely hearing a lot about sustainability in the design world. I mean I feel like it&#8217;s more so from a conservation/climate change kind of angle, but you hear about plant inspired materials or even &#8230; I think I was reading something about how they&#8217;re trying to change how computer storage is more like DNA storage or something like that, looking at DNA and seeing how it stores data to see how they could do it for hard drives or something like that, which I thought was really interesting.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean all of that stuff. I mean the more that you look at nature from &#8230; and I&#8217;m not saying from a &#8230; I&#8217;m not getting into the conversation around design versus evolution, not that kind of design, but when you look at what is actually the underlying mechanism that is allowing this organism to accomplish this task, what are the dynamics at play. When you break it down to almost a physics level, you really start to see all of these patterns and connections that just show you there&#8217;s some innovation at play.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So how can designers &#8230; I would even say probably developers that are listening to, how can they start to use biomimicry and biology in their work? How would you tell someone to go about doing that?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
So there&#8217;s several different resources that you can tap into. The organization, Biomimicry 3.8, that&#8217;s actually the organization that Janine, the author of the book on biomimicry, she started, and they do a lot of training and classes and workshops. No shameless plug, or shameless plug. Workshops are a great way to understand how biomimicry works and how &#8230; I might even be over-complicating how approachable it is to get into this, but one of the things that I always recommend is talking to a biologist about a challenge that you have, because they have the understanding of the biology, and that&#8217;s one thing that we always advocate for is this idea of having a biologist at the design table, because they can serve as kind of a translator of the phenomena that&#8217;s happening with the organism and how that might actually translate to the challenge that you as a designer are trying to solve.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
A biologist at the design table. I&#8217;m actually going to use that, because my mother is a biologist.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
She&#8217;s a biologist, so I grew up in labs and around all kinds of biological stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
That&#8217;s what up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So when you mention that, it&#8217;s funny because I mean I went to school for math and I graduated with a math degree and I was selling tickets at the symphony. For a few years after I had no plan at all. What are you doing with your life? My mom would be like, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; And I ended up &#8230; I was always doing design as a hobby and then I sort of fell into doing design as a job and then I started my studio, but I kind of always feel like &#8230; I mean I know she&#8217;s proud of me, but I feel like in the back of her head she was like, &#8220;What are you doing? This isn&#8217;t science. This isn&#8217;t math. This isn&#8217;t what you went to school for.&#8221; It would blow her away to let her know that there are these biological connections to design. I&#8217;m definitely going to use that. You think I&#8217;m joking? I&#8217;m going to. I&#8217;m definitely going to use them when I talked to her this week.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
No, yeah. Go for it. Go for it. She should be proud of you because you&#8217;re looking to expand your horizons as a problem solver, which is what we are as designers, and you&#8217;re using the natural world that she exposed you to to do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
That&#8217;s a good upsell.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I mean I grew up in the sticks, so all kinds of animals and running around in fields and all that stuff. So when you&#8217;re mentioning that about the little burrs sticking on things, I&#8217;m just thinking of &#8230; I&#8217;m thinking now of things that I&#8217;ve seen as a kid that would remind me of applications that people could use now. For example, the little roly poly bugs. I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;s a way someone is using a similar type of technology now for armor or something like that. It isn&#8217;t totally how that stuff is being used, but that&#8217;s amazing. You mentioned these workshops. You have your own workshop, BESA lab. Talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
So there&#8217;s two components to it. One is more kind of professionally design oriented for older kids and adults, and then there&#8217;s a second component which is more younger kid oriented that is really around kind of looking at nature through the lens of STEM and kind of having a fun exploration of the outdoors through kind of an inventor&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Interesting thing about STEM. I feel like it&#8217;s something when I was growing up, it wasn&#8217;t a big huge deal. Well, let me take that back. It was a huge deal in that they wanted to make sure that black people were going into these fields. I remember starting college. I started in a dual degree program. I got into that program because I had high scores in math and stuff when I was in school, and so I initially wanted to do computer engineering because I want it to be like Dwayne Wayne. That didn&#8217;t work out. After first semester I was like, &#8220;This is not going to work,&#8221; and I switched over to math, but it&#8217;s been interesting, I&#8217;d say within the past 10 years seeing how STEM is represented, I think particularly in black culture. I might be stepping on a hot potato here.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
No, keep going.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I hear a lot about STEM, but I feel like the focus is more so on the T and the E in STEM, not so much the S, definitely not the M. Let me tell you, everybody hates math. Nobody wants to touch math with a ten foot pole.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Man, you are not wrong.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you find that with what you&#8217;re doing with this sort of STEM education that people are trying to steer it towards more technical or more engineering disciplines?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
I think part of that is if you think about where our society is, the iPhone is still the sexy mobile device. I think that whole Steve Jobs era of introducing the iPhone and programs and apps, I think that with that you have a better sales pitch for technology and engineering than you do science and math.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
And I think that&#8217;s part of it. I think those are things that you can easily point to and they get the most buzz, they get the most shine, but all of the stuff that underlies that, like the math behind all of that, the physics of that, the science, those are really the two pillars behind the technology and the engineering part, which is kind of ironic about that whole thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
But yeah, I think you&#8217;re totally right. They definitely get a lot more of the shine, but just taking it back to biomimicry, that&#8217;s also another reason why I love it, because you get the opportunity to go outside and then just completely kind of deconstruct a leaf, and you get to see a leaf as this power plant, you know what I mean? It&#8217;s this chemical, there&#8217;s all these kind of chemical exchanges and dynamics at play. There&#8217;s structural integrity, there&#8217;s fluid dynamics, there&#8217;s all of these things built into a leaf, you know what I mean? And so just kind of taking it back to biomimicry, that&#8217;s why I love using it as a platform to talk about STEM, because I think the natural world is such an easy way to contextualize some concepts in science and math in a very kind of present way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, because then you can just tell people just go outside, look at the world around you and see how that inspires you. I&#8217;ve mentioned recently being in LA and one of the things that struck me as interesting was how plants were used as divisions in certain parts of the city. So if you go into Hancock Park or even further North to Beverly Hills or right around in that area, you&#8217;ll see a lot of houses that have these sort of protective hedges and topiary, but then if I went downtown, I just saw nothing but iron gates, iron gates, iron bars on windows, and it&#8217;s interesting because you see a gate like that and you think, &#8220;Okay, I need to stay out. This is clearly for staying out,&#8221; whereas the hedges felt more &#8230; I don&#8217;t know, almost like a privacy screen in a way. It was a really interesting thing. I noticed a lot of interesting kind of architectural stuff in LA, like all the arches and even a lot of the older buildings, although I heard that LA doesn&#8217;t really have that great of a culture for conserving old buildings, which was kind of sad, going down Broadway and seeing all the like burnt out marquees and stuff. It reminds me of New York, I guess that&#8217;s why they call it Broadway.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah, I get that. That&#8217;s one of the things, LA&#8217;s &#8230; I think part of it&#8217;s like cultural, which is a huge part of architecture. Architecture in a lot of ways is this kind of preservation of cultural philosophies and ideas of a certain time, and so when you have a place like LA where by and large, a lot of it&#8217;s about like what&#8217;s the latest and greatest, hottest thing? What&#8217;s the latest trend? And all that kind of stuff. I can see how there not necessarily is a great affinity for preserving a lot of the history, even though there&#8217;s a lot of really great history. I have a friend of mine who has this company called Mojo, and what they do is they essentially take you on a tour throughout LA and kind of tell you the stories in this really kind of compelling way of the history of these places, so you really get this really immersive flavor for the city and it&#8217;s kind of culture throughout time, but yeah, I&#8217;m with you. LA is such an interesting place.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you feel like it&#8217;s a good place for what you do? I mean aside from, like I mentioned earlier, the proximity to television studios and execs and stuff, but being around the nature that&#8217;s in and around the city, is it good for you?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Oh, absolutely. I mean one of the great things about living here, and you hear people say this all the time, is having the opportunity to go to the beach and then go skiing in the same day is one of those unique things about this place, and so for me, that also means that there&#8217;s all of these different ecosystems that I get to explore. The weather is awesome, but it&#8217;s such a great place to kind of just understand &#8230; again, going back to what we were first talking about with niches and kind of this diversity of life that you find here, not only just in terms of the people that live here, but also the biota, the natural life of this place. That&#8217;s one of the things I love here. I can go to the aquarium and I can talk about octopus with my daughter and then we can go to Descanso Gardens and get all of these different flavors for different ecosystems of our local area. It&#8217;s awesome for a lot of the stuff that I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now speaking of your daughter, do you find that she kind of wants to follow in your footsteps?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m seeing &#8230; she&#8217;s got the bug. So it&#8217;s funny. She&#8217;ll be turning five soon, and &#8211;</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
She&#8217;ll be turning five soon, and I&#8217;m a comic book nerd and I didn&#8217;t force this on her, but she took a liking to Spider-Man, so her whole room is decked out in Spider-Man stuff. It&#8217;s like our favorite movie and she loves spiders. She has no fear of bugs, or we were on vacation recently and we saw a gecko, I picked the gecko up and I had it in my hand and then I gave it to her and she was handling it gently and she was telling me how to handle it gently. So I was just like, &#8220;Oh, my baby. She&#8217;s got the bug.&#8221; Yeah, it was great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. That&#8217;s nice. What advice would you give to people that are listening that they&#8217;re inspired by your story, they&#8217;re hearing about your work. What advice would you give to any designers or techies out there that want to do what you do?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
I would say this is kind of a big theme and rooted again&#8230; Sorry. So, for me it goes back again to exposure, right? The more that you expose yourself to new things, things that maybe even make you uncomfortable to explore, the more resilient, the more versatile you become as a designer, the more innovative you become. It&#8217;s going left when you usually make a right. It&#8217;s simple things like that. Like challenge yourself to get out of your comfort zone and learn something new.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
For me, it starts like take a walk outside. Take a walk outside, and as a designer, breakdown when you see a squirrel climbing up a tree, what is actually happening, right? Or again, when you see a leaf falling to the ground, go and Google anthocyanins and understand how chlorophyll plays a huge role in the cyclical process of trees. I think I&#8217;m getting too out there, but there&#8217;s&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Not for me. Remember, my mom&#8217;s a biologist. So I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yep. I got you.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
There&#8217;s this poetry to the way that life works. And actually that&#8217;s a great book too, The Way That Life Works. It&#8217;s like a biology 101 kind of book. But just go outside, start there. That&#8217;s the first thing. Go outside, take your curiosity with you and just look around in your backyard and just try to find some connections that you didn&#8217;t see before. Just start there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s funny, I&#8217;m thinking back now, like my old days in science classes and stuff, and I used to be obsessed with the Krebs cycle. I was obsessed with it.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Oh.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
For people that are listening, the Krebs cycle, it&#8217;s basically, I mean to dumb it down very, very dumbly, basically we breathe in oxygen, we consume oxygen and then we exhale carbon dioxide and water and that is converted into energy, like ourselves converting the energy. So we can get what we need for energy just by breathing, and I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the whole concept behind breatharians, or whatever those people are that all they do is breathe to eat or whatever.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Oh, trying to eat. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But I used to be obsessed with that in high school because I was into comic books and stuff too, and I&#8217;m like that&#8217;s like some mutant power shit. We just breathe in oxygen and get energy from it. Oxygen is everywhere. It&#8217;s in full supply. How is this possible? You know?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
That&#8217;s the thing, right? Going back to your last question, I want to share with people, yes, my background is in biomimicry and yes I studied biology, but I don&#8217;t know everything about biology. As a designer, that was one of the things that made biomimicry approachable for me, was I didn&#8217;t have to right away know everything about biology. When you brought up that term, I didn&#8217;t know the term, but I understand the process, you know what I mean? The fact that that&#8217;s a chemical process, you know what I mean? There&#8217;s alchemy at play in the natural world and our bodies are a part of that alchemy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Absolutely. So where do you see yourself in the next five years? I mean, with the work you&#8217;re doing with the television show and Billy Biology and E-Slap, it&#8217;s 2025, what do you want to be working on?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Man, oh, there&#8217;s so many different things. One thing that I&#8217;m working on as a longterm thing is I really want to do more workshops in different locations, so I&#8217;m currently writing a proposal to different aquariums for being a designer in residence, a biomimetic designer in residence and having workshops at aquariums. That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m hoping to do, especially getting a chance to go back to the aquarium in Atlanta. I love that place.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I remember when they broke ground on that too. I was working downtown at the time and initially they were doing it because honestly they were trying to keep tourism dollars in the city, but they also were competing with Chattanooga, because Chattanooga has a really great aquarium and we wanted to have something that was a similar draw in the city. I mean, I&#8217;ve been several times since it&#8217;s opened. For someone that lives in the city, it feels like a hidden retreat. It&#8217;s right downtown in the middle of the city. I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s a really great aquarium. It&#8217;s a great place to just go and just spend an afternoon.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
It is, man, it&#8217;s so magical. Seeing that whale shark fly over your head in the tunnel and just that huge wall. I mean I just, I love getting lost. You can just fade away, in a way, you know what I mean? Just staring into the aquariums. That&#8217;s one thing that I&#8217;m hoping to do more of, and then I would love to do another TV show. There&#8217;s a couple of, now that I understand the way that wildlife filmmaking works from this perspective, I&#8217;ve been working on a couple of different additional show pitches for ways to extend that, that I&#8217;m hoping will be picked up in the next couple of years as I work on them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m curious, what do you think about the, so there&#8217;s like these, I don&#8217;t know if I would call them up and coming, but there are these sort of, we&#8217;ll call them aficionados because I don&#8217;t know necessarily how professional they are, but there are these nature aficionados on YouTube and social media. Do you see yourself in the same realm as them or is the work that you&#8217;re doing on a different level?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
It depends on which nature aficionados you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was thinking of two people off the top of my head. The first person I was thinking of was Brother Nature, and the second person is this guy named, I think his name is Coyote Peterson, I think.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. I saw some video where he was getting stung by a bullet ant, and I was just like, why?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah. He&#8217;s next level. The cool thing about him was he started on YouTube and he wound up actually getting his own show on Animal Planet as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
So you know, props to him. I couldn&#8217;t do what he does. I like to tell people my perspective is as an African American male coming into the world of biology, but my primary lens and my primary approach is that of a designer, right? So for me, my design philosophy is where nature, science and design intersect. When I&#8217;m communicating biology, the biomimicry background and my background as a designer and storyteller is what I think is my distinction. Brother Nature, shout out to him, and The Real Tarzann and all of those guys who are bringing people and making nature less intimidating. I think that&#8217;s great that they do that.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
I think depending on your understanding of some of the more technical and academic debates around how you interact with wild animals, that&#8217;s a separate topic. But again, for me exposing Latino kids or Latin X kids and African American kids to nature in a way that they wouldn&#8217;t before because of them, I&#8217;m all for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know about Coyote getting bit by the bullet ant. I&#8217;m passing on that one. I got the chance to be in Costa Rica and see bullet ants up close, and, nah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, you&#8217;re like, I&#8217;m good, I&#8217;m good.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Yeah. What I say when I come across things like that is I&#8217;m not there in my biology yet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Gotcha, gotcha. I hear you. All right. Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Billybiology.com is the website where I have everything, and you can also find me primarily on Instagram at Billy_Biology, is the handle and yeah, hit me up and look out for a podcast called Nature Be Wildin&#8217;.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nature Be Wildin&#8217;, I like that name. That&#8217;s a good name. That&#8217;s good.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Man, Billy Almon, thank you so much for coming on the show. It&#8217;s very clear to me just based on the conversation we&#8217;ve had and the work that you&#8217;ve done that you sit at this really interesting intersection of nature and design, and I guess technology in a way too. You sit at this intersection, and it&#8217;s something that we need to see I think on multiple levels. One, because there&#8217;s always talk about there&#8217;s not enough black people in tech, black people are underrepresented in technology and design. So it&#8217;s good to see someone doing that. But then also, there&#8217;s all these stereotypes around black people in nature, like black people don&#8217;t hike, black people don&#8217;t camp.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Granted, I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;s probably some, well, I know that there&#8217;s racial bias in it because there&#8217;s laws that said we couldn&#8217;t, back in the day that we couldn&#8217;t camp out in national parks or things of that nature.</p>
<p><b>Billy Almon:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I think some of that is certainly an inherited kind of trauma, I guess in a way. But you&#8217;re also bucking that stereotype and bucking that trend too. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m a black man in nature, showing you how nature works and how you can use it to have a more sustainable future or to use it for greater things. I mean, you&#8217;re a visionary. You really are. I&#8217;m really glad to have been able to talk to you and to talk about the work that you&#8217;re doing, and I&#8217;m really excited to see what you do next, so thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>

She is the founder of <a href="https://chillcreate.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ChillCreate</a>, a lifestyle brand that celebrates creative living and the choice to create happiness where you can.</p>
<p>Carolyne shared her inspiration behind starting the brand, which grew out of her love for Brixton and the Afro-Caribbean culture there. Carolyne also spoke about her time here in the United States, gave her thoughts on diversity in the UK creative community, and talked about her current work as a graphic design lecturer at Ravensbourne University! Carolyne&#8217;s creativity shines in everything she does, and I think you&#8217;ll agree after listening to this interview!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Hi there, my name is Carolyne Hill. I&#8217;m a creative director. I&#8217;m a specialist in branding and I have my own brand called ChillCreate and I&#8217;m a designer. I&#8217;m an all around creative.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What was your impetus behind starting ChillCreate?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always wanted to do from when I was a little girl and I got to a point in my career, I was the director, art director, creative director of a design firm and that was my goal from when I started out in my design career. And I got to this goal and I was just really bored and I wasn&#8217;t really feeling the type of clients I was working for anymore. I wanted to do something different. And to be honest, I was even questioning whether I wanted to be a designer anymore. So I went off traveling, I took some time out, explored a bit, went full hippy, went off with a camera and a sketchbook. And when I came back, I just had some designs, some ideas, which were a lot more just completely different to anything else I&#8217;ve ever done. And it was a print. I ended up making some fabric and experimenting with a few products, which I got a friend to make for me. And that was the birth of ChillCreate. I basically wanted to start a fashion brand.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So what is sort of an average day like for you these days with ChillCreate?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Well, at the moment ChillCreate has kind of taken a back burner because although that&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s online, it&#8217;s ticking away, online sales still happen. Last year, I had to focus a lot more on my branding side of things to actually pay the bills as, I don&#8217;t know if you know, but yeah, as a creative, you often have the balance between the work that is your passion and the work that pays the bills.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
So ChillCreate is my passion and the work that pays the bills is my branding work. So I&#8217;m an independent design consultant. I help people build their brands, their communications, that type of thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. How do you go about sort of choosing the types of clients and projects that you work with?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Well, I&#8217;ve been really lucky thus far. I&#8217;ve been an independent creative now for three years and I haven&#8217;t actually had to go out looking for work. So my way of getting work is through networking. I like socializing. I like being out and meeting people, so it&#8217;s really old school. But I get my business cards out, I chat to people, I tell them what I do and I get my clients that way. But I have to say I&#8217;m now in the process of actually beginning to think, &#8220;Right. How do I now choose the type of clients going forward?&#8221; I think trying to find clients which I can believe in what they do is really important to me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I guess they would also have to mesh with sort of, well, if you&#8217;re coming to them as a brand consultant and they might, I guess they&#8217;re like at the beginning stages of their business or does it really matter?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I do have people at that beginning stage of their business and that tends to be kind of start-up entrepreneurs. They are super excited and great and have super amounts of passion, but they don&#8217;t necessarily have big budgets. So the type of clients that I like to try and work with more are people that are perhaps already on the road with their own entrepreneur side of their business, they&#8217;ve probably been doing it for some time and now they&#8217;re trying to take it to the next level. They&#8217;re trying to step it up so they&#8217;ve already got their brand. They&#8217;ve already got their philosophies, but they now need time and help to hone in on their key values, strategies and identities.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. At work, we just wrapped up. We just wrapped up and launched a project last month where we use, it was a independent branding agency, I think kind of similar to what you&#8217;re doing with ChillCreate, and it was amazing just kind of seeing how precise they were with asking all these questions and really making sure to get to the root of what the brand was about that we wanted to build. It wasn&#8217;t just, &#8220;Oh, make us a pretty style guide.&#8221; It was what are the values and everything that go into it, which I thought was pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah, I think it&#8217;s so important. For me, it makes the design process easy because sometimes if you&#8217;ve got a client who just wants you to make them a pretty logo, something that looks nice, I can go off, I can create a pretty logo. Yeah, but then they come back, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s not quite right. It doesn&#8217;t pop.&#8221; You know, the classic it doesn&#8217;t pop. But if you work with the client and you then start to understand their values, where they&#8217;re coming from, who they want to attract, then it really hones in on the actual style, the content, the philosophy, and it then becomes really easy to work with the client developer relationship where you both have an identity or project at the end which everybody&#8217;s really happy with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When it comes to approaching a new project, what&#8217;s your process like?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I think to start with, it would be to sit down with the clients, have an open discussion about what it is they hope to achieve and I take them through kind of a brand strategy process that I used to use a lot when I was working for these other agencies. It&#8217;s where you build up a set of values, you then build up to the next stage. So it&#8217;s like a pyramid chart where you build up from the values, to the promise, all the way up to the brand essence. And then once you&#8217;ve got these things, you&#8217;ve got essentially without the actual design, you&#8217;ve got the brand. And then from there we go through sort of imagery search and creative stages of designing, feedback, and then applications. So it&#8217;s quite a straightforward process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Are there any companies or clients out there that you would love to collaborate with?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Oh goodness. I guess I think for me, I actually asked, I&#8217;ve started lecturing recently and I actually asked my students this question just the other day. And while I asked them, I felt myself, &#8220;Who would I like to collaborate with? What would be the ideal, the most amazing project?&#8221; I think for me it would be, I&#8217;ve worked perhaps this year a bit more on my own personal graphic style and then I imagine that, I don&#8217;t know, [nightcore 00:08:08]. Somebody comes to me and says, let&#8217;s do a collaboration. I&#8217;m talking out of this world kind of ideals. So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well hey, put it out there in the universe. You never know.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
You never know, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What would you say is the hardest part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I think the hardest part for me is often working solo. I used to be the director, have a whole team, so I would have bosses above me. I had kind of strategy stuff on the left and then I had a whole team that I managed. And so going from that, basically being the boss, the middle person, and the person doing the running around, that has been one of the hardest challenges. And at times I have people to share the work with and other times I don&#8217;t. I sort of have to expand and contract, depending on the job. So that&#8217;s been quite a major challenge.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So let&#8217;s kind of switch gears here a bit. I know just from doing my research that you&#8217;re from London, right? You&#8217;re London proper.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yes. Born and bred.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Born and bred. What was it like growing up there?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I have very fond and happy memories growing up in London. I grew up in Brixton, which is South London, I guess the equivalent to stateside, massive might be like Brooklyn or something like that. So it&#8217;s a very Afro-Caribbean neighborhood with a lot of energy, a lot of vibe about it. And school and everything for me was great. I loved school, growing up in London was fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When did you know that art and design were things that you were interested in? Were you exposed to that a lot in Brixton?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah, I was exposed to a lot from my parents. They were very creative parents themselves. They&#8217;re not creatives themselves, but they just have lots of creative friends, lots of artist friends. My grandmother was a painter and we used to go and visit her. She lived in Cheltenham, which is sort of just past Oxford and she&#8217;d have watercolor paintings going on the whole time. And I always wanted to be an artist. I think from a very young age, I was really excited when we&#8217;d go to galleries and look at art. I remember being about 10 years old and loving Andy Warhol exhibitions that my parents had taken me to. And of course lots of my parents friends were artists. So I&#8217;d grew up in this very creative community. So I knew from a young age that I wanted to be an artist or a designer or a fashion designer. And then yeah, I got to school and quite quickly I was kind of told, &#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t want to be a starving artist, Carolyne.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Were your parents and family kind of supportive of you though, going that route?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Oh yeah, they were super supportive. I never had any problems in terms of convincing my parents that I was going to be an artist because I&#8217;d been saying it from when I was, like I said, about 10 years old, maybe younger even.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But at school you were hearing something different.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yes, quite often at school you&#8217;re paired up with careers advisor. And I remember the careers advisors saying, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know really about you being a designer or an artist. Maybe you should be a social worker, something a bit more achievable.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah. Can you imagine?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I can&#8217;t imagine. When I was in high school, I had my guidance counselor at the time was always telling me that you need to learn a trade. And here in the States, learning a trade is blue collar work, like a mechanic or fixing air conditioner units or something like that. And now granted, I was valedictorian in high school. I graduated the top of my class. But she was like, &#8220;Well, just think about it. You might want to think about learning a trade or something because you never know. One day&#8230;&#8221; I&#8217;ll never know one day what, that doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
One day, what? Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah I was the same. I was top scorer in the school. So there&#8217;s no reason why we shouldn&#8217;t have been pushed to do exactly what we wanted to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. And you went to the London College of Printing, which I said this before we recorded, I was like, &#8220;It sounds like a college for printing.&#8221; which seems like a very intensive thing to study. But what was your time like there?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
It&#8217;s changed names now. It&#8217;s the London College of Communication because essentially the printing world is dead or depleted. But yeah, I guess it&#8217;s background, the London College of Printing was that it was an arts college, part of the London Institute, which focused on the kind of printing, publishing and arts, which then moved into digital. So I actually studied retail design and business management, which was actually an interior design degree for public and commercial spaces. So it was a mixture of sort of design, but also business and branding was very heavy, was a big part of it. So you had to both design the interiors, brand the interiors, and understand how you are going to make this commercially viable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. That actually sounds like a really modern program. When I think about what a lot of schools try to teach, it&#8217;s more so just the design and not the business aspect of it.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yes. At the time, I remember thinking, &#8220;Oh my goodness, the business side is so boring.&#8221; But actually, having left university when we only had access to computers one day a week, I kind of feel like everything I learned in university on the creative side was great. But as soon as I started the job, I was on the computer 24/7. So all this hand drawing skills that I learned, I never actually had to use in my job for a number of years. But the business side of things was very informative and I still kind of think about what we did learn and it was very good in that respect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, that&#8217;s really good. I mean we had back on the show, I think it was maybe about&#8230; God, I&#8217;ve been doing the show for seven years now. I think it&#8217;s been about two or three years ago, we had Douglas Davis who wrote this book about kind of the business of design, learning basically what you learned in college, learning the aspect of not just branding, but how do you design towards business goals. How do you keep those in mind while also still creating something that looks nice, that serves the client&#8217;s needs but is more than just a pretty thing?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Exactly. It&#8217;s the strategy. I think they changed the name of the course after I did it and they switched it around a bit. I&#8217;m not sure if they still combine the design with the strategic side anymore. But I remember there was one book which was really important at the stage. It was called the Design Agenda. It&#8217;s so old now, but that was like the course bible and it was basically brand strategy and design management.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And what did you say it was called? The design what?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
The Design Agenda.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The Design Agenda. That sounds kind of sinister, but I kind of like it. The Design Agenda. No, I liked that a lot. So what were your first design jobs out of college. You graduated, you now have this not only design skill but the business skill. You&#8217;ve got the degree to back it up. What were those first design jobs like for you?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
So my first job I got was designing for Tesco&#8217;s, which is one of the UK&#8217;s biggest supermarkets and I got the job and I was super excited because it took me a while to get my first job and I said, &#8220;Great, thank you. I&#8217;ve got the job. Sorry, what is the job?&#8221; Because I didn&#8217;t actually know what the job I was applying for. They said, &#8220;Graphic designer.&#8221; And you just heard me say I actually graduated from an interior design degree. And that&#8217;s when I said, &#8220;Oh great. Yeah.&#8221; They said, &#8220;You can do that?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; I was just so happy to have a job. I wasn&#8217;t about to tell them that I&#8217;m not a graphic designer, I&#8217;m an interior designer. So I did it. I learned straight in at the deep end, designing for one of the UK&#8217;s largest supermarkets. I had to design buy one get one free messages, frozen food signage, just really boring till messages, anything and everything that you see on the kind of point of sales side within a supermarket.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
That then gradually grew into being put in charge of whole departments, graphics, art direction for photo shoots of frozen food, being in charge of the entire UK&#8217;s carpark signage packages. So it was a fast paced agency, it was a massive agency. It was a sink or swim kind of situation and yeah, I went in, front stroke, swimming hard.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well I think it&#8217;s good to kind of be in those sorts of situations because it pushes you to become a lot better I guess pretty quickly given how large Tesco is as a brand.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah. You had to, you really had to deliver quickly. It was one of those agencies where you would work &#8217;til sometimes midnight, two in the morning and you still had to be there at 9:00 AM. I learned a lot in that company. And I also learned straight away from my experience there that I didn&#8217;t want to work at another big agency like that again. So after that, I went to smaller agencies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It&#8217;s amazing. I feel like the agency experience is universal. No matter who I talk to in any country about working for an ad agency or something like that, it&#8217;s the same type of breakneck speed or the same type of huge, just workload. That&#8217;s wow.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah. I think you can handle it for a while and some people love that.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I think you can handle it for a while, and some people love that kind of vibe consistently.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think when you&#8217;re young it&#8217;s good, because you&#8217;ve got the energy to do that.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah, and you&#8217;ve got the fire to keep fighting and pushing back, constantly delivering. But I think I figured out very quickly that I didn&#8217;t really like working for other people.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, you were doing these sort of small agency gigs. We spoke about this also before recording, that you worked even here, in the U.S., for a little bit. Just briefly, right? In New York City?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah, I always wanted to come to New York and, I don&#8217;t know, I wanted to be a designer in New York. I came out, I did some house-sitting in Brooklyn, and then I got a really cool gig looking after somebody else&#8217;s apartment in the Lower East Side. While I was there I just was trying to find jobs, and it was very difficult, as a Londoner, trying to get into the New York agencies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What made it difficult?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Well, there&#8217;s the whole issue of your green card and who was going to be your sponsor, and you had to prove that your service was not able to have been filled by a United States citizen. Agencies, they kind of weren&#8217;t really interested in having to go through all that rigmarole, and maybe I didn&#8217;t have the right contacts at the time. I was quite na√Øve in that respect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I think it&#8217;s still tough. I have a friend, he&#8217;s from India. He went to school in Canada and he was here in Atlanta for a while, but now he lives out near L.A., in California. I remember even when he was looking for jobs how difficult it was, because of those same kinds of issues with companies that wouldn&#8217;t sponsor him, or he had to be sponsored on a certain visa so there were only certain types of jobs that he could look for and not something that could really advance him in his career. It had to be something more lower level, so you kind of were stuck at one point because the job may offer you the paperwork that you need to stay here, but it&#8217;s not really something you can succeed in or you can grow in.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Exactly, and that&#8217;s where I found myself. In the end I had a great time exploring New York, living the life, doing yoga. I was just hot-desking, going to cafes with my laptop, working on &#8230; I was actually working for magazines at the time and record labels from London, so it was quite a fun time. You know, coming out of the big corporate chain of supermarkets, high street retailers for a while, there was me designing cute stuff for record labels and magazine spreads for [Touch 00:20:49] Magazine, which was one of these kind of R&#038;B Hip Hop magazines in London. So, it was fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What year was this, just to kind of put it in context?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Oh, my goodness. In context, I would say that would have been around, oh gosh, 10 years ago, now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so right around late-2000, something like that?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Gotcha. Okay. All right.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I know. Time&#8217;s gone fast.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at your early career experiences, up to what you&#8217;re doing right now, when you look back at those, what do you feel like those experiences taught you?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
It&#8217;s been quite varied. I enjoyed being a freelance designer, as well as then going full-time to be an employed designer. The bits that taught me the most were probably the freelance parts, because you got to jump around to lots of different types of agencies and work on lots of different projects. Of course, each time you work on another project you kind of come back and you say, &#8220;Well, actually I can charge more.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
So, it gave me a really good experience across a wide range of types of projects: working with interior designers for a long time, which was great, because that&#8217;s where my original training started. I also worked with architects, and did a little bit of work with ad agencies. I worked with TV companies, mobile phone operators. It&#8217;s been really random and quite varied, so I think that&#8217;s the advantage that was given me, is that now that I&#8217;m working for myself, I do have a very varied type of client base. And I like that. I like things when they&#8217;re varied.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s one thing I really enjoyed when I was freelancing, too, that I could sort of bounce around and see how I can use my skills with different types of clients. Back when I had my studio, I would &#8230; maybe one month I&#8217;m doing something for a cosmetics brand, and then it&#8217;s pivoting to work for a software company, and then it&#8217;s pivoting to work for a solo entrepreneur that&#8217;s writing books, or something like that. And so, you find a way to kind of use your skills in these different ways.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What I think, and maybe this is different in other places, maybe this is unique to Atlanta, but what I found sucked was that once I went out looking for a job, they wanted you to sort of be a specialist. Instead of being a generalist that could take your skill and apply it to anything, they wanted you to only have worked in this particular type of design for years or something, which &#8230; I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Is that when you were applying for jobs in big agencies?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I don&#8217;t know if they were all big agencies. Mostly they were software companies or tech companies. I think they just wanted to make sure they had someone that understood, I guess, tech. Like, right now I work in a software company. There&#8217;s a lot of jargon that goes around that I know probably most designers either don&#8217;t know, or don&#8217;t care about. I&#8217;ll be honest. I don&#8217;t care about it most of the time, but I know enough to be able to translate it, and know what I have to know for my work. But it wasn&#8217;t something where, &#8220;Oh, you have to have had this many years of experience in a SaaS company.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like &#8230; This is something that I want to explore more this year in general, is that it feels like everything is converging towards tech, every single profession in some way is converging towards technology. Maybe it&#8217;s because tech is everywhere, maybe it&#8217;s because even in things that I don&#8217;t think we realize, AI and machine learning are parts of them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Even in the most seemingly low-tech job, like farming or something like that, there&#8217;s so much technology in farming. It feels like everything is certainly converging at some point towards tech, so having those singular kind of work experiences almost &#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know if that really prepares you for this sort of new world, where everything has to do with tech.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah. I don&#8217;t know. I do think about that sometimes because I think, like you, I don&#8217;t really care for the techspeak and the &#8230; I use tech. I love tech. I love new things and learning new things, but I don&#8217;t necessarily want to be in tech, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. No, that totally makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I think for me, I would rather &#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I think personally, for my own creative ambitions, I want to [inaudible 00:25:19] more to the art side of things to step away from tech. Because although I understand a lot, I can learn, but I don&#8217;t really want to spend my time having to become a specialist in it. And I think so many people do it so much better, so why should I &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to make that my purpose. I want to stick with creative thinking, because I don&#8217;t think that will ever go out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, no.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I think it might be short-sighted in the sense, &#8220;Oh, you need to be [inaudible 00:25:47] in tech,&#8221; but actually, it&#8217;s a very different skill to think creatively and to come up with creative strategy and ideas. Tech exists, but it needs ideas to make it functional. So, even if perhaps, I don&#8217;t know, maybe in the future I might have to get into tech, but I would hope that I get into it on the ideas side of things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I see now &#8230; You can tell when a solution has been thought up by a group of engineers and there&#8217;s no tech people in the room, because it may work, but it doesn&#8217;t look good or it&#8217;s not user-friendly. Granted, design is a very visual medium, but there&#8217;s also UX design, and a lot of that has to do with more psychological things about-</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How does the user feel about this? Is this word choice proper? Things like that. I know one, this is a project I worked on with &#8230; this is with a client years and years and years ago. It was very clear that they wanted to have this new content management system for their newsroom, and the software developers there had come up with a solution. They were like, &#8220;Oh, well it works because it does these technologies and this, this, and this, and all this stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But the actual user interface was so bad to use. I think it was &#8230; God, was it DotNetNuke? It might have been DotNetNuke. It was something super-obscure that 0.01% of companies probably use right now. It&#8217;s not WordPress, by a stretch, it&#8217;s not something that&#8217;s simple to pick up. It&#8217;s like if you were making an article, you had to make an article in these blocks, and so you had to think of &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Say you were writing a piece, and the piece has five paragraphs and two images. Each of those paragraphs is a block, and each of those images is a block, and so you now have to abstract, &#8220;Oh, well you just take this paragraph and put it in this block.&#8221; Then someone&#8217;s like, &#8220;What if I want to put a picture next to it?&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, we didn&#8217;t think of that. Well, why don&#8217;t you put the picture underneath it?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
They&#8217;re like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want the picture underneath it. I want the picture next to it.&#8221; Like a pull quote or something going outside the margin. It&#8217;s like the engineers didn&#8217;t even think of that. They were like, &#8220;Oh, we never considered that use-case.&#8221; That sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
So, it&#8217;s important. I think there will always be room for the non-tech, but in tech.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At this stage in your career, what is the London design scene like? How do you experience it?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I live and work in the Shoreditch area, which is like designer central. I&#8217;ve always worked in and around this area, which is how I ended up living up here. It&#8217;s fast-paced, there&#8217;s design companies on every corner. It&#8217;s big business, some of the worldwide agencies are here. But for me, my design community is perhaps a bit more local: as in my peers, my friends, the sort of creative family, and there&#8217;s a lot of crossover in between our creative endeavors.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Since working for myself, I&#8217;m beginning to perhaps work with fellow creatives, but on different things. So, I have people who are photographers, who are artists, who are fashion designers, writers, TV people, all in my circle of friends and associates, and I think there&#8217;s a great crossover.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I think at this moment, especially within the black arts scene in London, it&#8217;s a great opportunity and time, because there&#8217;s been a lot going on. I&#8217;m starting to see some of my peers, people that I&#8217;ve known for a long time now, actually reaching sort of great heights of success. I&#8217;m reading about them in publications, and seeing friends of mine who are now the artists being featured on packaging for quite famous products here in the U.K.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
So, I think it&#8217;s a really good time. It&#8217;s an exciting time. It&#8217;s like if you&#8217;ve got the staying power to just keep going and reaching out to these connections, I think it&#8217;s a good time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It sounds like it&#8217;s booming, if that&#8217;s the case.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t know about booming. I think London is one of these places where you can boom, but you can also bust real quick. There&#8217;s opportunity, definitely. There is definitely opportunity to boom, but it&#8217;s, I think, probably like anywhere at the moment in our societies. It&#8217;s quite hard work, but then you get these little nuggets of goodness and growth and prosperity, which keep you going until the next-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I know here in the States the conversation around diversity in design, it seems like it&#8217;s ongoing. Is that the case also in London, or I guess in the U.K.? Do you find that there&#8217;s a lot of conversations around having more people of color involved in the design industry as a whole?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yes. Yeah, there&#8217;s always this conversation. I think for myself, as a person of mixed heritage from Brixton, London, I&#8217;ve always been the only person of color, and often the only woman in the room in these design agencies that I&#8217;ve worked for. Working now for myself, I&#8217;m just working with all black people and loads of women, and loads of people who are just open to be creative. It&#8217;s kind of refreshing, because in my earlier career I&#8217;ve always been the only one in the room, so to speak. So, that discussion is going on. I don&#8217;t know how much it&#8217;s going on within these big agencies itself, because I stepped out of that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, that makes sense. Because a lot of it, what I hear is mostly about employment. It&#8217;s not necessarily about all over, general numbers. Here in the States it started from the diversity in technology conversation, which was looking at big tech companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, and seeing how their workforce broke down. It started to go over into design, but I feel like it&#8217;s mostly been just about design departments at tech companies, and not about these ad agencies, or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Well, we&#8217;re seeing it a lot in the press. It&#8217;s slightly different, but even in the BAFTAs this last week we&#8217;ve had, there&#8217;s nobody of color that&#8217;s been nominated for anything, and that&#8217;s just completely shocking. Then you&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;Well, who&#8217;s doing the nominations?&#8221; Well, of course, is there anybody representing there?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
But then over in the literary field, we&#8217;ve just had the first black woman to win the Booker Prize for her book, &#8220;Girl, Woman, Other,&#8221; a writer called Benardine Evaristo. Her book is fantastic. I recommend everybody go read it, it&#8217;s really good.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
There are sometimes things are changing, but I don&#8217;t know. There always has to be the first, and then are there any others? And how do you keep it going? I think it&#8217;s a constant discussion and a constant struggle, so to speak. I think at the moment, with the society that I&#8217;m in at the moment in London in [Brexit 00:33:09], I feel I just have to get on and do it myself, in whatever that is that I want to do to make the change that I want to see.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I feel like here in the States, it&#8217;s similar to that. I think it depends on the industry. We just had the Grammys here a few weeks ago, I think. For people that are listening, we&#8217;re recording this in early February, so this is &#8230; Grammys were last week. My whole calendar is a blur, so I apologize. But I know the Grammys were recently, because unfortunately they happened the same day that Kobe Bryant passed away.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There was conversation, I think, around some of the big names in the music industry, black folks in particular, like Puff Daddy, some other folks, et cetera: about how the Grammys are not treating black artists well, and they sort of lump us in these other categories and things like that. I was having a conversation with some people, and the thing that came to me was, why don&#8217;t they just start their own awards?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I got pushback from it, I think for two reasons. The first reason I got pushback was because, how come we always have to make the solution? Like, the system doesn&#8217;t change if we just sort of make an alternative to it, which I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But then, the other pushback I got was the value of what that even means. A lot of people in the music industry look to Grammys as some pinnacle of success that you&#8217;ve reached in your career. For some artists it means you will get paid more, it opens the door to more opportunities, collaborations, et cetera. That may not be the same case with a perhaps lesser-known award. So, it&#8217;s also about, I guess, the value that the industry gives to these types of honorifics. It&#8217;s like a whole power structure thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I agree with you about, we have to do it ourselves. Because if we keep waiting for the system or keep pushing at the system for things to change, sometimes it changes. Sometimes it does. It can be slow, it can change in unexpected ways.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But then if we&#8217;re able to do these things ourselves, we sort of become the masters of our own fate in that way. We can control and shape the exact message that we want to get out there without having to go through some filter, or gatekeeper, or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yes. I think sometimes if you&#8217;re constantly trying to prove yourself in a structure that has no interest in hearing you, you just get worn out and worn down. So, I think there&#8217;s a point at which you just brush it off and do your own thing.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I&#8217;m not saying you stop trying. I&#8217;m just saying you&#8217;ve got to focus on what means something to you and the passion that you have within yourself, creatively. Because the whole system can get on top of you to the point where you lose that creativity, and you lose that buzz, and the inspiration which made you want to enter these roles-</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
&#8230; inspiration, which made you want to enter these roles, competitions yourself in the first place. It&#8217;s kind of like you have to do everything, but for me the priority is you&#8217;ve got to focus on your own passion and your own self and your own community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So speaking of knowing friends of yours that have had these sort of big campaigns and this visibility, you yourself had a popup exhibition at the Tate Modern last summer. Can you tell me a little bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yes. That was so exciting. It was a really random opportunity that came my way, and I just said, &#8220;Yeah, cool, I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221; And I had no idea what I was going to do, but I was given a sort of loose topic to explore, and I ended up exploring the question: where do you come from? Because as a person of mixed heritage from London, I&#8217;m always asked, it&#8217;s the second question, apart from, what&#8217;s your name, that people ask you, &#8220;But where are you from?&#8221; And you say, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m from London.&#8221; &#8220;No, but where are you really from?&#8221; You say, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m from Brixton.&#8221; &#8220;No, no, no. What&#8217;s your heritage?&#8221; You say, &#8220;Well, my mother&#8217;s Jamaican, my dad&#8217;s English.&#8221; &#8220;Oh!&#8221; And so you&#8217;ve always got all these layers of questions that come your way.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
So I felt, especially as the Brexit drama we&#8217;ve been having, this negative rhetoric about identity, which is going round. I wanted to explore it. So I did some posters, had this exhibition, was up there for a week, and it was just the most satisfying and exciting experience being at the Tate Modern, which is one of my most favorite places in the whole of London.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What was the reception that you got from it?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
It was great. I had the posters and then I wanted people to come in and ask and answer the question themselves, where are you from? So I had people from all around the world come and make their own versions of my posters, which filled all the walls in this kind of pop-up space. And even this week I had a message on Facebook from a lady from Peru who came and was part of the exhibition. She was a poet and she just wrote me a message this week saying &#8220;Hello, I miss the time we had at the Tate Modern.&#8221; I was just like, this is amazing. I met so many people. It gave me so much confidence to think that I can be an artist, I can take my design skills, my creativity, and I deserve also to be here in this space at the Tate. Yes, so it was really good fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I guess, also with taking those skills, you&#8217;re also now a part time lecturer at Ravensbourne University. So you&#8217;re putting it out there in the community as well.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yes, that&#8217;s right. I wanted to have the opportunity to give back and to be that inspiration that you see. And like our conversation at the beginning here when we were in college or university, we didn&#8217;t necessarily have people that looked like us to necessarily guide us in that direction. And I just feel that my experience as a Londoner would be valid and useful to anyone at university for whatever their background. And so I&#8217;ve just recently started, I&#8217;ve given one or two lectures, and I&#8217;m really enjoying the tutorials and getting to know the kids. Yeah, really it&#8217;s quite exciting. It&#8217;s very different to my usual day job.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What are you finding that they teach you?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Man, they&#8217;ve got so many ideas. They&#8217;re teaching me a bit about tech. They&#8217;ve all got the latest computers and every single app and all the applications. I don&#8217;t necessarily have the latest computer myself. So what are they teaching me? Definitely just different kind of thinking. They&#8217;re coming from a different place to myself and they&#8217;re just ready to explore. They&#8217;re at that point of exploration. And I think for me it&#8217;s great to see that because it just opens your eyes again to exploring.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s an interesting thing about lecturing and teaching, especially if you&#8217;re self taught or you&#8217;re entrepreneurial in any way, because you take all these things that you&#8217;ve learned from trial and error and now you&#8217;re like teaching it to someone else. It&#8217;s a weird kind of feeling because, I don&#8217;t know, for me, when I did it, I used to kind of feel a bit of imposter syndrome, like, why am I at this place teaching this? Like I taught a brief class at Savannah College of Art and Design, and I was like, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t go to art school. What am I doing here? I&#8217;m just a guy off the street teaching these kids and stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
But it&#8217;s amazing how that, I feel like they want to hear that though. They want to hear that kind of real experience because in a way that&#8217;s sort of where they&#8217;re at. Like they&#8217;re not a known entity or they don&#8217;t have these years of experience yet. So they kind of want to hear the real thing. They don&#8217;t want to hear the package speech, I guess, about, work hard and all your dreams will come true. Like will they? That sort of thing. So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah. I think they want to hear the sidesteps, the roundabouts, the up and down that you go through. Because I think maybe this generation, they know that it&#8217;s going to be quite hard to get a job. They&#8217;re seeing it all the time. There&#8217;s no such thing as a job for life anymore. And even getting a job is going to be really hard for them. So I think they&#8217;re aware of that. And so I just think, I know what you mean about this imposter syndrome by the way, because on the first time I had to get up and speak, I was really nervous. And the senior lecturer, she did her speech, her lecture, which was good. And when she put up on the board all the clients that she&#8217;s worked for, I looked at it and thought, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ve worked for pretty much the same clients over the years.&#8221; So that&#8217;s one layer that dropped off of my insecurity, because it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ve done what you&#8217;ve done.&#8221; Her whole experience was completely different though.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
And then the other lecturer gave her talk and she&#8217;s, I would say much younger than myself and the other lecturer, I mean, her experience was also completely different. And that&#8217;s when I actually became really comfortable because I was like, &#8220;This is exactly where I&#8217;m supposed to be. I&#8217;m different to these other two. I don&#8217;t need to be what they are, who they are or where they&#8217;ve been, because I&#8217;ve got my own story and my own journey.&#8221; All of that imposter syndrome dropped off, and I saw the kids looking back at me smiling, which meant they must be engaged. So I&#8217;m good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s so good when you reach that point, because I mean, one, it instills in you this confidence that you know exactly what it is that you&#8217;re talking about, what it is you&#8217;re doing. Because it&#8217;s your experience. Who knows it better than you do? Your own experience. Right? So of course you can speak on that from a position of authority. I think the imposter syndrome does sort of come in when you try to do that comparison to what other people are doing.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
It&#8217;s the worst thing you can do, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And it&#8217;s interesting because I&#8217;ve talked to people lately about, and it&#8217;s mostly just been about podcasts and some stuff about design, but they&#8217;re always like, &#8220;Wow, you&#8217;re so confident.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve worked my ass off to get here. So yes, I am confident because I know what I&#8217;ve done to get to this point to be able to talk about it with authority.&#8221; So it&#8217;s a good feeling once it does go away. So how do you define success at this point?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I think success at this point means being happy, yeah, success means being happy. If you&#8217;re working to pay the bills and you can&#8217;t quite make things stretch, are you happy? I don&#8217;t know. You need both the commercial success as well as the creative passion success. So for me, being happy means that I&#8217;m successful. That means that I&#8217;ve got enough money to pay the bills, I can take some holidays, but I&#8217;m also creating things that I am proud and happy to work on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Is there anything that you&#8217;re obsessed with at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Just music. I&#8217;m always obsessed with music, listen to different music every single day. It&#8217;s what keeps me designing and keeps me working.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Who are you listening to?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Today is a complete mix up of music and tracks. I started off the day listening to, okay, then judge me, it&#8217;s going to be really random, yeah?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Beyonce&#8217;s Homecoming was the first thing to get me out the house, a bit of Curtis Mayfield, then I jumped into some Nina Simone, then I&#8217;ve just seen Queen and Slim, so I listened to the Queen and Slim soundtrack. And then this afternoon we listened to some Alfa Mist. I would say I&#8217;m very obsessed with Alfa Mist, they&#8217;re are kind of UK ambient soul jazz band. They&#8217;re really good. I listen to them a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
So it&#8217;s a very varied playlist for today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s actually a really good playlist. That&#8217;s really good. I&#8217;m into like, so I don&#8217;t know, my music taste is all over the place. I don&#8217;t even know if this is something I&#8217;ve talked about on the show, especially when I was in college and my early 20s I was so, so big into British music. You have no idea. My favorite band was Jamiroquai. I listened to Radio One just on the internet or whatever. So I knew about producers and artists like Alice Russell and Ben Westbeech and Will Holland, and I mean, I still listen to a lot of that stuff. I think Alice Russell has a new album coming out this year, knock on wood, I hope she does. But I listened to a lot of stuff from the UK, a lot of music.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I went there, it was the first time I was in London, it was in 2017 is actually, it was the first week that I started this job. They sent me to London for the first week. I was like, what? That was so mad. I did not get to listen to the radio, go to any bars or anything, because it was all work. I didn&#8217;t have time and I didn&#8217;t know where places were and stuff. I was like, &#8220;Oh man, I missed the golden opportunity to really be in the UK music scene or whatever.&#8221; But, oh man, I love it, love it, love it. But I&#8217;m not going to pull up my music director and everything, but I&#8217;m a big, huge British jazz fan, British soul. Oh, all that. Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah. Well I listen to a lot, and it&#8217;s what gets me designing, and I feel really happy when I&#8217;m at my desk. I share a really nice little studio in Brick Lane with two other creatives, and I love it. And we play music all day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s something that perhaps maybe not many people understand about you?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Gosh, put me on the spot there. I think one of the things, maybe not understand, but they don&#8217;t maybe realize is, you can very easily put out this persona, especially being like a brand owner, that everything is always going amazingly and ticketyboo. But when you&#8217;re a creative working for yourself, that there are often those times which are like major highs and that&#8217;s what everyone sees. So maybe people don&#8217;t necessarily understand that, me, this big vibrant person who&#8217;s very happy to be out socializing, can also be at times a bit of an introvert and can have those moments of self doubt.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Because I think now, especially with social media and design, it&#8217;s like you always have to be putting something out there for people to see so they know that you&#8217;re still doing it or that you&#8217;re still out there making work. So it&#8217;s hard to kind of, I don&#8217;t even want to say take a break, but you rarely see the downs, you mostly only just see the ups.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Yeah. And I think when you are working for yourself and you&#8217;re running your own business, you know, I run two businesses at the moment, you&#8217;re doing it all yourself, so you don&#8217;t necessarily have anyone to share that burden with in terms of on a business level. And to the outside, people don&#8217;t necessarily see that. And well, I think that&#8217;s just life at times, but maybe that&#8217;s what people don&#8217;t see or understand about me as much.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Where do you think your life would&#8217;ve gone if you weren&#8217;t working in design? Like did you have a backup plan or anything?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I really enjoyed sociology, studying that at school. I think if I wasn&#8217;t in design, I don&#8217;t know if I would have gone into that kind of social world, but maybe a different type of creativity if I wasn&#8217;t a designer, you know? I think stage design, it would be something that I would love to have explored, because it&#8217;s so conceptual and fantastical and random.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I guess London&#8217;s a big theater city, so that would&#8217;ve worked out.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
That could have worked out. Yes. I do a lot of work with theaters at the moment, and I really enjoy working with people, helping them visualize their creative concepts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. What do you want your legacy to be?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
CarolYne Hill, creative from Brixton. I don&#8217;t know. I think my legacy would just be to be remembered as somebody who was a creative who designed and was here, maybe did a little something to change things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? It&#8217;s it&#8217;s 2025, what are you working on? Or what do you want to be working on?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I would like to think by 2025 my businesses are going really well. I&#8217;m perhaps actually running a team, not perhaps, I&#8217;m running a team. Things are pretty organized. And those things are ticking off nicely, but I think personally I&#8217;d like to have explored my artistic side more and be in the process of creating artwork as opposed to design and designing for other people. I think that would be a really nice thing to aim for for the next five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
I have a website which is carolynehill.com. That&#8217;s Carolyne with a Y rather than an I. My other brand: chillcreate.com</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right. Sounds good. Well, Carolyne Hill, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you for really just kind of sharing your journey. I know we didn&#8217;t include this in the interview, but the connection that you and I both have is from the late Jon Daniel, who was also on the show, and I know you mentioned him being a big inspiration to you, a big mentor to you. And I think with the work that you&#8217;re doing with ChillCreate, I mean, having an exhibition in the Tate, and then really I think just living a proud creative life, I think that&#8217;s kind of the dream for all of us, and I know, I really feel like that would have been the dream that Jon would have wanted to see from you. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Carolyne Hill:</b><br>
Thank you very much. You&#8217;ve been a wonderful host.</p>

<p>You know, I&#8217;ve interviewed hundreds of Black creatives over the years, but none of them have had the enthusiasm that Fonz Morris possesses. He is the growth design lead at online learning platform Coursera, where he oversees a staff of talented designers from all over. We talked about hiring, diversity and inclusion, and he gave some great advice for up and coming designers looking to land their dream job.</p>
<p>Fonz also shared his story of growing up in Brooklyn and teaching himself architecture, going to college in Atlanta, starting his own music distribution platform and creative agency, and how those experiences led him to where he is today. Fonz is all about pursuing his dreams, and after you hear his words of wisdom, you&#8217;ll be inspired to go out and do the same!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
My name is Fonz Morris. I am the design lead on the growth team at Coursera.org which is an online Edtech company based out of Silicon Valley focusing on transforming lives through education.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
How did you get started there?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Once my last startup that I helped get off the ground ended up not working out for me, I told my wife that if I was going to get a job back in corporate America or go back and lead the entrepreneurship space, I wanted it to be out in California. I just knew the community that was out here, I knew the weather, I wanted a change of environment. I&#8217;m a father I wanted to raise my daughter in a different environment than New York City or Philadelphia and I just started to pursue opportunities out West and I applied to different positions. Recruiters hit me up from different companies and ultimately I landed at Coursera in August of 2018.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
All right. What kind of projects are you working on there as a growth design lead?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
So currently we just released our new homepage, which is doing fantastic. The numbers are up 4% across site wide which is really exciting for those of you who understand metrics. I have recently worked on redesigning our promo unit system framework, which is really important for us because we have a lot of different products that we need to promote to different learners at different times. So our old promo unit system was just ineffective and it wasn&#8217;t really producing traffic and it was really hard to develop the promo units, it wasn&#8217;t scalable. So we redid that, that was very successful. I also helped redo our degree white label framework. Degrees are a really important part of Coursera and for the future of Coursera and we have about 18 degrees now and each one is from a different university.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
So they need their own place to be able to house the necessary information. And another product that I worked on is our new UX search results page. We were having some issues with not getting users to the right content that they wanted so we completely revamped that. And then also being on the growth team I work on a lot of smaller experiments. We&#8217;re really experiment based where we&#8217;ll roll out two, three smaller iterations of something to get the data from that to be able to make a better educated decision on a design, which those are smaller tasks. So it&#8217;s split between big projects like the ones I said originally and then smaller ones that are more targeted towards growth specific and iterations.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I got you. So it&#8217;s a lot of, at least it sounds like it&#8217;s some user testing involved with it when you&#8217;re doing this sort of comparison.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Yes sir. Lots of it. So once again, I&#8217;ll get technical real quick. Usually what we have is a control, which is what the actual live current site is. And then we&#8217;ll have a variant A, variant B, a variant C and then we&#8217;ll roll out each of those variants to a specific target group. And we&#8217;ll get the numbers back from those and then that way we can compare the effect that each design had on each target and be able to make a decision based off the metrics.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
What&#8217;s a regular day like for you there? It sounds like there&#8217;s a lot of meetings, a lot of maybe cross functional work, stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Lots of meetings. I don&#8217;t think I would&#8217;ve ever thought that as somebody with designer in their title that I would have so many meetings. So I would say it&#8217;s funny, it&#8217;s really interesting and I had to get used to that because as a designer I was a solo person. I was used to just sitting in front of my computer zoning out and cranking out designs where now I would say my time is split almost, maybe 60/40 sometimes even 70/30 meeting design. And then we use split in not necessarily formal meetings but one-on-one meetings with the other designer that&#8217;s on my team.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Because I&#8217;m a design lead I support the other designers on the growth team as well. So when you add all of that up, you&#8217;d be surprised how much time I actually spent meeting but that&#8217;s because I&#8217;m helping come up with decisions and helping other designers come up with decisions with things like that. To where my job is no longer only focused on what I can physically produce, but also what I can emotionally and technically help other people with or grow with and things like that. So it&#8217;s funny how many meetings I do have nowadays though.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
So how many designers are on the growth team?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Well, right now we&#8217;re about nine. At our highest we were about 12 but that&#8217;s something else that&#8217;s tricky out here is the turnover at companies because a designer wants a better opportunity or they&#8217;re a contractor or it&#8217;s just not a good fit. So you see teams grow and shrink way more often than I thought, but right now we&#8217;re at about a strong nine.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. I would imagine out there in Silicon Valley because there&#8217;s so many tech companies out there, really so many design focused tech companies that if you&#8217;re a designer of a certain caliber you kind of can just bounce from place to place if you want to. You know?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s what it feels like. You definitely get reached out to a lot of companies, but the hiring process at these companies are kind of tricky. So even if you are skilled you still got to go through their hiring process, which is definitely something that I wanted to talk about today. Because I don&#8217;t know how many people understand how much work it takes to get on at one of these companies and just how sometimes is also even just the luck of the draw. Because there&#8217;s so many phases of it, you never really know which phase could take you out or if you&#8217;re going to get through all of the phases as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Listen, let&#8217;s talk about it because I&#8217;m actually in the middle of hiring, well not hiring, I&#8217;m on the interview team so I&#8217;m doing a lot of phone screens and resume screens. Let&#8217;s talk about it because I actually have a lot to say about that. Talk to me I guess when it comes to what you are looking for out of designers. And it doesn&#8217;t necessarily I think have to be specific like skills. I&#8217;m sure you know skills are transferable, but what are you looking for when you&#8217;re hiring for someone at Coursera?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
I think the level of designer is important because that ties into what we&#8217;re going to ask them to produce. And by that I mean if we have a lot of production work, if there&#8217;s a lot of designs that need to be produced that maybe we&#8217;ve already did a lot of the work for and we don&#8217;t need to put a lot the full product design process into this, then we could say maybe we&#8217;re looking for someone who is not a senior level designer but they&#8217;re not really junior. And so because of that, now we&#8217;ll be looking for communication skills, we&#8217;ll be looking for the ability to do user research.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
We may not be expecting you to take a full project on that may go two or three quarters because you might not have had that kind of experience yet. But we&#8217;ll be expecting you to be able to lead some things to a certain extent without any handholding to a certain extent as well. And that you determined through asking questions, asking them what type of responsibilities they&#8217;ve had at their previous position. You&#8217;ll ask them what type of things they&#8217;re interested in and looking forward to working on if they get a new position. And then it&#8217;s your job as the interviewer to take all the information and see if the two situations align and feel like a good fit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Do you find that there are certain skills or certain qualities that you&#8217;re looking for in particular?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
I think at the end of the day we want to work with really nice people, good people and that&#8217;s what I really value about Coursera is that I really like my coworkers. Everybody is friendly, everybody is smart, there&#8217;s not a lot of egos you feel you can trust each other and those are more on the personal side than they are the technical skills. So I would say and being transparent. When we asked you what your last job was about, we don&#8217;t want you to sound as if you were the best thing since sliced bread or you were the LeBron James of product design.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Because we want some people to have humility, so we want you to be able to tell us how you worked with a problem and how you solved it. And if maybe you bumped heads with somebody on your team that doesn&#8217;t say anything about you, we are just really trying to figure out how you handle challenges. So we&#8217;re looking for those types of things as well of problem solving and being able to maybe compromise with some people to figure out how to get past a certain point if y&#8217;all both were bottlenecked on a idea. So all of these are not technical things, these are just soft skills.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. It&#8217;s amazing to me how and this is something that I sort of knew this before, but certainly once I started interviewing and hiring designers and just creatives in general. Your personality and your behavior oftentimes are more important than what you have on your resume or your cover letter. I mean, certainly that will get you I think in the door or get you past the screen but like you said, you want to work with people that are going to fit within the culture. And I know culture fit can kind of be a negative term that is thrown about but like you say, you want to work with nice people. People that you can get along with and do work with, that&#8217;s really important.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Cultural fit is important and I don&#8217;t understand why culture fit is a negative word. It&#8217;s important. Why is it important? Because as a black man, when you think of what does it mean for me to be a culture fit somewhere? What does that mean? If it&#8217;s not a black organization, then what culture am I trying to fit into? So I understand how it could be like a negative situation, but I also think it&#8217;s coming from the perspective of do you have an ego? Are you just a nice person? Are you friendly? Do you get along well with others on your team? Are you supportive? Do people want to come to work with you?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
And that&#8217;s just important because you&#8217;re with your coworkers more than you are with your family sometimes. So culture fit is important to me, but it does get tricky. And I know why people say that, but I definitely think culture once again goes into soft skills as well. And that&#8217;s just really important because if I&#8217;m not talking to you about designs or if you&#8217;re not literally doing the design, then you&#8217;re most likely using your soft skills. If that&#8217;s communicating or sharing or analyzing or critiquing so that&#8217;s why it ends up being really important for someone in the product space to be strong on both sides of the coin.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
What other sort of advice would you give like for someone that&#8217;s not necessarily saying that they&#8217;re looking to work at Coursera, but if they&#8217;re looking to get into this industry. What advice would you give to an up and coming designer that wants to get a job in design?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
I love that question. That&#8217;s one of my favorite questions that I have actually spent days, hours, months trying to figure out what&#8217;s the best answer to that. And I recently spoke at AfroTech and I&#8217;m really happy to be able to have come up with the best answer to that question right before I did my talk. And my answer is I think you should take a second and think about all the different products that you interact with, and what&#8217;s your favorite, and then figure out would you want to work at that company. And if you want to work at that company then you should go to that company&#8217;s career page and you should look at all the positions that they have available.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
And if any of those positions jump out to you, you should go into it, you should read the job description and then you should read those requirements. And those requirements are pretty much your checklist of the skills and things you need to learn to be able to one day get that job. So I think that&#8217;s a no cost, really valuable step that a lot of people don&#8217;t do but could do and should do to really learn the details of what it would take to possibly land your dream job. Because why I say this also is think about it, somebody who has not developed any of their skills yet why just blindly develop skills or go after skills that you heard somebody else say?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
When you can think about where you want to be in your life, what company you think makes you happy. Or if you want to build your own product, think about a company that built something like that and then still go to their careers page because you still need that same information. You need a starting point and I think that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve learned from a lot of people that might be transitioning careers, or trying to reskill. They need a starting point and a job description is a really good starting point.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s some really good advice. I like the fact that you saying take that as the things that you have to do, the checklist to get that particular job. And I would even say especially if you still want to work for that company, even if that particular position may not be what you think it is, it can at least hopefully get your foot in the door there. There might be something else that you end up doing, the company might see what else you bring to the table they might make a position for you. I mean it&#8217;s a rarity sometimes, especially depending on how established the company is but especially in startups like tech startups? Absolutely. Like the job that you get, is not necessarily the job that you will keep if that makes any sense.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Yes, that makes a ton of sense. But when you think of it, how many people visit a company&#8217;s career page? You don&#8217;t have to only visit that page when you&#8217;re looking for a job, they&#8217;re learning sources. They&#8217;re a knowledge base of this is what this company is asking somebody to do this position should know. And it&#8217;s literally like your syllabus almost, it&#8217;s like your career syllabus and that&#8217;s what I want my two cents to be to everybody. Is visit all of the job boards of all the companies you like and start taking notes and look and see if there&#8217;s any redundancy in some of the skills that they&#8217;re asking. Because then those are the ones you really know you should learn as opposed to just like I said, blindly trying to follow after somebody else and pull in skills that you think might be the hottest trends because those might not be the hottest translator.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative) that is very true. One weird thing that I&#8217;ve run into with interviewing and I don&#8217;t know if this is hubris or just like garden variety racism, but sometimes I will interview non black candidates and just the tone that they take with me, or the way that they will answer questions or not answer questions. Or ask if there&#8217;s someone else that they can speak to because they looked at my LinkedIn profile and they&#8217;re like we&#8217;ll. I&#8217;ll give you an example and this is not tied to my current employer if you happen to be listening, but I&#8217;ve certainly interviewed people before that have said, &#8220;Oh well I looked at your LinkedIn and like you&#8217;re not really a designer, so is there a designer that I can speak to?&#8221; This is back when I had my studio, which I thought was very interesting considering like I run the studio so if you&#8217;re talking to me like the buck stops here. Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
People want it to only be interviewed by designers?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah, and I guess, I mean I guess I&#8217;ll be transparent this has also happened at the place that I work. But it&#8217;s interesting how, I don&#8217;t know if this is like a new thing that happens in design, but like I don&#8217;t think people realize that just because you&#8217;re interviewing with one person that you&#8217;re also sort of suddenly being interviewed by an entire team. That person is trying to see if you fit not just in the company or in this role, this particular singular role, but do you fit with the team? Do we want to hand off work to you? Do we want to hand out projects to you? Do we like you at the end of the day? And if this is how you&#8217;re acting at the phone screen stage then you can forget it.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Right, I understand what you&#8217;re saying. I don&#8217;t think that the&#8230; Okay, so I disagree with that. I think the first round should be anybody the company wants to be just getting a temperature check of where you are and who you are as a person. And being able to just what are you into? Why do you want to leave your job? Tell me about yourself. I don&#8217;t really think you need to be a specific profession to ask somebody those type of high level, let me get to know you type of questions. So I think the recruiter being the first person that you speak to makes sense because I need to vet as well as all the people coming through the door.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
I&#8217;ll let you speak to our designers and stuff like that in the second round where we&#8217;re going to get a little more technical, but for the first go, because it&#8217;s so introductory I don&#8217;t necessarily. I never felt as if the first person I spoke to needed to be a designer. I was just really honestly to be candid, I&#8217;m just always happy to even make it to the phone screen. So I&#8217;m not focusing on who I&#8217;m talking to, I&#8217;m more happy that I&#8217;m talking to somebody.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. Okay. I can see it in that viewpoint. I still think though it just helps to not be a jerk essentially.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Yeah. No, no always. I am always about respect and professionalism. I think that is so important I can&#8217;t even think of the&#8230; Enormously important. You should never be a jerk to anybody if you&#8217;re trying to get something from them, that&#8217;s just common sense. So if you&#8217;re trying to get a job and I&#8217;m your first access point to the company and you&#8217;re not being nice to me, I&#8217;m not sure how far you&#8217;re going to make it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s true. And I&#8217;ve definitely run into that several times, but I guess in terms of-</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. In terms of other advice, I can&#8217;t stress enough the importance of having a really good portfolio. I looked at your website, I see you have your portfolio and I mean it&#8217;s great because it lists not only the things that you&#8217;ve done, but also the thought process behind it. I know that I&#8217;ve talked to designers, young designers they&#8217;re like just starting out or just coming out of school. And I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;s so important for you to actually talk about your design decisions and not just show a bunch of mock-ups or a bunch of pretty pictures like that. Anyone can generate that, you can buy a mock-up thing from I don&#8217;t know, mighty deals or somewhere for like 14 bucks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Slap in a few logos all of a sudden look at all this work that I did that&#8217;s on billboards and folders I&#8217;m like no, it&#8217;s not. It doesn&#8217;t really exist in the real world. But like to talk about the why behind why you&#8217;re doing certain things. Those shots might look pretty, but the critical thinking I think is more important as a designer. I mean, that&#8217;s why I think if you&#8217;re a visual or if you&#8217;re something like product or UX. It&#8217;s just still important to be able to articulate that in some way.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Right. So tell the story. That&#8217;s another piece of information that I would want to say is people want to hear a story. So when you only show the final design, you jumped to the last page of the story. So I don&#8217;t know what the story about, you just jumped to the end. You know what I mean? So it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know what story you just told me and it doesn&#8217;t really show me how you got to that final design. And that&#8217;s why some feedback, I actually just did a mentor session yesterday at Adobe with a organization out of San Francisco.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
At Adobe with organization out of San Francisco named Kaskade SF. And it was fantastic because I got to actually interview about five junior designers and walk through their portfolio and give them feedback. And that was what I was focusing on the most was, &#8220;Are you telling me a story to get me from the top of the pace to the bottom of the page?&#8221; That&#8217;s what&#8217;s so important. And you do that through breaking it up with letting me know what the problem is and letting me know that you understand the industry that you&#8217;re in. And then walking me through how you think about this could possibly be solved and do you understand the user and understand what the user wants from this. And then that helps you figure out what your information and your content should be. And then it goes into information architecture. So it&#8217;s a whole flow that you can end up telling somebody that would really help them understand why you made the decisions you made. And that&#8217;s what people are really trying to get from your portfolio.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Yes, they&#8217;re trying to [crosstalk 00:25:06] about me page and read a little bit about you. But from your skill side, they&#8217;re trying to figure out how you handle this problem, what you did in the process and how you did it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Absolutely. So speaking of the story, we have you on here to talk about your story. So tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
So I grew up in Brooklyn, New York. I went to a public art high school. I&#8217;m a self taught designer, which I like to say that, not to brag, but more of as an inspiration for anyone to know that once again, like I said earlier, if you work hard at something I&#8217;m a true believer in you can achieve anything that you put your mind to. So I wanted to be architect when I was young and I taught myself architecture and went to a art high school. From art high school I went into computer science at Georgia State. Well, I started at Morehouse actually getting my degree in computer science. And then I transferred from Morehouse to Georgia State and that&#8217;s where I actually finished my degree in computer science.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
And I taught myself&#8230; In my senior year of college, Georgia State got a grant from the state of university from&#8230; Georgia State got a grant from the state to build a multimedia lab on campus and they completely furnished it with all new multimedia equipment, Mac equipment, PC, Adobe, Macromedia Pro Tools, Final Cut, new Canon equipment. They completely furnished it with all new things for us to use as students. And I pretty much just moved into the lab and I taught myself everything that I could possibly know there. And it was a great experience.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Let&#8217;s step back a little bit. So self-taught designer also here, same way. Was your family supportive of you going into design or architecture? Did they see this as something that you could do for a living?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
I don&#8217;t think I spoke to them enough about it. I was always a academic type of student, so as long as I stayed in my books, my parents were supportive of anything that I was doing. I actually had a friend whose father was a black architect and then I tried to get an internship with another black architect and I took some courses at Parsons School of Design when I was in high school. And this energy showed my parents that I was really interested in architecture. So I did have support for them. But I will say, I don&#8217;t know if they knew to the extent or to the degree that I wanted to pursue design or pursue architecture at that moment. I tried to show them the best I could through the work I did at school and through my passion for looking at buildings and constantly reading architectural books and architecture magazines. So I would say that they supported me to the best that they knew how.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay. What drew you to architecture?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
I just feel I&#8217;m a&#8230; Because I like design at the end of the day. And growing up in New York City, you&#8217;re around a lot of skyscrapers and that&#8217;s where some of the most famous architects have planted their seeds and you&#8217;re walking up and down Fifth Avenue or when you&#8217;re walking in Soho or in Brooklyn and you see all these amazing art deco style buildings and these modern buildings from with all these different heights and windows. And then you see you got the Brooklyn Bridge and you got the Manhattan Bridge and you got the George Washington Bridge and the Queensboro Bridge. It&#8217;s so many different bridges that you&#8217;re seeing and these are all amazing examples of architecture. So I would think growing up in New York City is what exposed me to architecture. And being in the city is where they made me say, &#8220;I want to design one of these buildings one day.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. Now I also went to Morehouse, so I have to ask about it. What was it like when you got there? What was it like when you first got there?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
It was an amazing experience. Being a black man, wanting to connect with other black men in a higher education space. It was really self rewarding and I was very proud and accomplished. I also wanted to attend the HBCU as well. My sister went to North Carolina A&#038;T, so it was almost as if I felt as if I had made it to a certain level, education-wise, because I had made it into Morehouse, which in my community was respected as a very prestigious school for black men. So I loved the experience. I ended up transferring though in all honesty because one, I paid for college out of my pocket and Morehouse being a private college&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Is very expensive.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
&#8230; The tuition is way higher than the State University as well as they don&#8217;t offer in state tuition. And then sadly, which this has a trickle down effect. The resources that I needed to be successful just wasn&#8217;t available at Morehouse while I was attending. But I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a shot at Morehouse. I think it&#8217;s an eye opener to understanding the value of getting funding and what you can do with the right money.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Because Georgia State the other hand had all of the new equipment, all of the new computer labs, all of the things I needed to pursue my computer science degree successfully, Georgia State was able to give me. So that&#8217;s why I left Morehouse. From a cultural or from a personal feeling, I really loved going to Morehouse. It really made me proud going to campus every day and seeing so many other brothers trying to better their lives and their family lives to getting a higher education. But when it came to the resources, the State University just had an abundance of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. And at Georgia State, geographically, you weren&#8217;t that far from Morehouse anyway.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
No, [crosstalk 00:07:07].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
It&#8217;s you could take the 13 down to Fair Street and you&#8217;re right there on campus.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Yeah. I can take Ralph David Abernathy right across would be there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
No doubt. So yes, yes. And Atlanta is still a very black focused city.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
So when I left to go to Georgia State, I didn&#8217;t have any regrets. I felt as if I was just doing what was the best for me at that moment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
But I love Morehouse. I love Morehouse, I think it&#8217;s very important institution in our community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
It&#8217;s so interesting you mentioned that about the resources. So you got there in &#8217;97 I think you said? You got there in &#8217;97 I got there in &#8217;99. I also started out in computer science.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I started out, actually dual degree computer science, computer engineering because the scholarship that I had, we had to major in one of the STEM fields.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
And I wanted to do computer science mainly because I wanted to do web design. I had been learning web design on my own, just reverse engineering webpages at my mom&#8217;s school&#8217;s computer lab and teaching myself HTML because&#8230; I&#8217;m from a small town, Selma, Alabama. We didn&#8217;t have a bookstore. The library had one computer that could get on the internet.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
So we didn&#8217;t have a whole lot of resources around learning this stuff. At the college they had more resources, but I was teaching a lot of that stuff myself and so when I went to&#8230; And also I would say I wanted to major in computer science because I want to be Dwayne Wayne from A Different World.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Nice. Listen, in all transparency. Part of the reason I wanted to go to a black college as well was because A Different World, like you just said, as well as TLC dropped the Baby Baby Baby video. It was like&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Man.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
&#8230; &#8220;Is that what college is like? Are you kidding me?&#8221; I&#8217;m not missing out on that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a think piece or something out there on The Root or The Undefeated or something about how hip hop and the 90s and how they glorified college. You don&#8217;t see that now. There was&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
[crosstalk 00:33:13] wearing college sweatshirts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
My God.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
[crosstalk 00:33:15] college, let&#8217;s be smart. You know what I mean? You don&#8217;t have none of that anymore.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
None of that. Man. But I got to Morehouse&#8217;s campus. I started out computer science, computer engineering. Switched to, I think I switched to computer science maybe after the first few weeks or so because I didn&#8217;t really want to do the engineering part. But I wanted to do web design and I remember, I was sitting, these names will take you back. I was sitting in Dr. Jones&#8217; class and&#8230; Did you take a class with Dr. Jones?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Which class is that?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I think I might&#8217;ve been computer programming one, I think? One of the intro classes.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Man, listen, don&#8217;t make me show how old I am. I would have to go through my transcripts and look for any of my names and my professors.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
But I remember, the thing that I didn&#8217;t like about Dr. Jones, and he&#8217;s passed on, rest in peace, but the thing about Dr. Jones was he wouldn&#8217;t teach. He would sit in class and tell all his anecdotes about his fishing buddies and growing up and all this sort of stuff. And we&#8217;re just sitting here, &#8220;When is the class going to start?&#8221; And I don&#8217;t know if this was a way to weed people out, but then when you are ready to go to the next class, then he would start teaching. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;I guess we got rid of all the stragglers now we can start learning something.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
But Dr. Jones was also my advisor and so I remember going to&#8230; You remember the secretary Mrs. Banks? Man. I don&#8217;t know if she&#8217;s still there or not, but man she was my best friend at Morehouse all four years I was there. Because I ended up switching my major to math largely because&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah, I switched my major to math because I was&#8230; I met with Dr. Jones and I told him I wanted to go into doing web design and I showed them some design stuff I had did. I did the design for the Project Space Scholarship Program and I was like &#8220;Look at all this stuff I&#8217;ve done.&#8221; And he was like, &#8220;Look, the internet is a fad. All this WW web stuff, this stuff ain&#8217;t going to be around. That&#8217;s not what we teach you here. If that&#8217;s what you want to do, you need to change your major.&#8221; So I was like &#8220;Well, shit I guess&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
See, that&#8217;s the problem is that computer science programs should have picked up web development years ago.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. But this was 1999 though. I don&#8217;t know that many colleges that would have had a curriculum. So, which is not to say that he was wrong [crosstalk 00:35:37] don&#8217;t get me wrong, but they didn&#8217;t have anything.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
He was really like &#8220;If this is what you want to do, you need to major in something else.&#8221; And I thought about it and looked at my transcript and my credits and stuff and so I switched over to math because I had enough credits from taking AP math courses in high school and say &#8220;Well if I switch over to math I can just graduate early.&#8221; For me I was thinking &#8220;How soon can I get out of here?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Because I was figuring like&#8230; And also my freshman year was rough. That&#8217;s a whole other story. But I was really thinking like &#8220;How soon can I get out of here and get my degree?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Right [crosstalk 00:36:14].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
And I switched over to math and just stayed in math and I graduated in three and a half years. So I technically graduated in &#8217;02 but I walked in &#8217;03. But yeah, even then there was nothing. I remember the computer lab there being so&#8230; And not to rag on Morehouse because now it&#8217;s gotten better, now they have a whole technology tower. I think Dr. Chung was still teaching back then, but now he&#8217;s the chair. He&#8217;s the chair now.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
But I remember they just had these old archaic Sun Microsystems, Silicon Graphics workstations.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I&#8217;m like, &#8220;What in the hell is this? How am I supposed to use this? I have to use Linux?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Its tough. Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
It was rough. It was really rough back then and I was like, &#8220;Man, maybe it was a good thing I did change my major.&#8221; Although, to be clear&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
But that&#8217;s why HBCUs need to be able to get the funding from the government to be able to pay for these things. You know what I mean? A lot of the HBCUs pay for this stuff with their own money and that stuff&#8217;s expensive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Although to be clear, when I switched over to math it wasn&#8217;t I was going into a technological workplace either. They had these&#8230; I almost felt as sometimes I was sitting in a one room school house, just really bad quality desks. Blackboard broken.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
HBCUs need funding.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Then again this is&#8230; Yeah but this is &#8217;99 to 2000. And I would imagine it&#8217;s different now. Honestly part of me didn&#8217;t know any better because I&#8217;m like &#8220;I came from Alabama. So we use chalkboards and overhead projectors because that&#8217;s what we use in high school.&#8221; So when we&#8217;re doing that in college I was like &#8220;This is what you&#8217;re supposed to do.&#8221; And then I knew people that were going to Georgia State and Georgia Tech using these smart whiteboards and stuff. I was like &#8220;What? I&#8217;m out here sketching out comic solids with a piece of chalk and y&#8217;all are just keying in an equation and getting the graph? What?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
My God. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Very funny. I agree with you and I understand what you&#8217;re saying and they&#8217;ve made a lot of progress since those days, which is good to see. I was down there about two years ago and when I walked on campus I could see the growth. It felt good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah, they&#8217;ve definitely grown a lot. Now I would say they still&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. Morehouse has its, and not to rag on Morehouse, but Morehouse has other issues outside of funding and just curriculum and software and hardware and things like that. But it has grown a lot. I will give it that much. The performing arts center and all of new equipment&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Yes, The Ray Charles Performing Art&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
&#8230; And things, a revamped cafeteria and everything. Movies are shot on campus now. A good part of Hidden Figures was shot on Morehouse&#8217;s campus.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Tyler Perry is changing Atlanta man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
He&#8217;s bringing that film, they&#8217;re heavy, which is good because there&#8217;s a lot of money in that space.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yep.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Atlanta. I miss Atlanta sometimes. I honestly do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Hey it&#8217;s always here. Always here if you want to come back.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
The [crosstalk 00:39:15] not going anywhere.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nowhere. So you transferred to Georgia State and you&#8217;re talking about how it was different from Morehouse. Once you graduated from there, what was your first design gig? What were you working on?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
I started doing flyers for people and doing business cards and doing logos for anybody that needed it, no industry specific. And then I started to get better at that and that&#8217;s when I got my first project ever was&#8230; Well my first ever paying gig was a website for a furniture company, a small indie furniture company. And I think they paid me, I think the whole deal that my partner worked out with ended up being I think either 35 or 5,500 for a full website. And I just could not believe it when he came back with a 50% deposit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
And I said to myself, &#8220;Are you kidding me man? They actually gave you that money?&#8221; And that&#8217;s what led me know that there was a lane for me. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Is that where Third Eye Designs cam out of?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Pretty much. I&#8217;ve always been a believer in having your third eye open and then designs and that just felt the best name of a company possible to me was Third Eye Designs. And so that furniture company was Third Eye Designs first paying client.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay. How long were you freelancing like that?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
I still do it to this day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
They almost&#8230; Because it grew from freelancing into, now that I&#8217;m later in my career, it&#8217;s just consulting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
But I don&#8217;t call it Third Eye Designs anymore. But the process or the concept of doing freelance design work, I still do it to this day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
But I&#8217;ll always be able to do that. Which that&#8217;s the thing, which ,message, this is why you always want to learn a skill because they can never take that skill away from me. So because I&#8217;m a designer, they can never take that away from me. I can always make money doing design, whether it&#8217;s at a company or whether it&#8217;s freelance or whether it&#8217;s trying to build my own product. So that&#8217;s the value of having a relevant skill.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah, absolutely. So how long was it until you moved back to New York City?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
After I was doing Third Eye Designs, I realized maybe I could get a job in the industry and that&#8217;s when I got my first art director position at a money transfer company that was a small, tiny version of a Western Union and I did that for almost two years. And that&#8217;s where I really got my first bearings and understanding what it&#8217;s like to work with engineers who are going to be building your stuff and this is what a web developer is versus a web designer and really understanding the programming languages like that. And then I actually had a tragedy in my family. A little brother actually ended up getting killed in New York.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Man.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
And that&#8217;s what I decided to just leave Atlanta. It was just a whole life changing experience for me and I just felt I needed to be back around my family. And so I left Atlanta to go back to New York. And when I got to New York is when I got my first agency job where I was working on a lot of different marketing style materials. Banners, flash banner web banners, landing pages for entertainment companies, movies. And New York is a good place for design. So it was an easy place for me to get a job once I left Atlanta.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Now was this at My Artist&#8217;s DNA?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
No, this is not even&#8230; Portfolio, well not portfolios, but resumes are so hard to decide what to put and what not put. My Artist&#8217;s DNA was pretty much what Third Eye Designs&#8230; It was Third Eye Designs first product.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay. I gotcha.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
So I&#8217;ll keep going with this and it&#8217;ll start to make a lot more sense. So once I went back to New York and I started working in the agency space, I kept the Third Eye Designs idea going with the same partner and we started to do even bigger projects for even more people. We worked with Def Jam and we did Kanye West banners and we worked with Def Jam and we did Jagged Edge stuff and Rick Ross and we worked with Universal Music and we did movie releases. And we just realized, &#8220;Wow, we&#8217;re getting good at this. We&#8217;re actually getting real clients.&#8221; And then another partner of ours from Morehouse joined on board. He opened up his network and then we was doing work with real estate companies and all these other different new businesses. And what ended up happening is one of our clients that we had did a lot of work for, Aqua hired us. Actually the&#8230; It&#8217;s an amazing story.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Our first angel investors were a family out of Pennsylvania, the Lomax family, the honorable Dr. Walter Lomax. He was actually Dr. Martin Luther King Jr&#8217;s physician, his real physician. And that&#8217;s the craziest part, he&#8217;s a legend&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
&#8230; That most black people don&#8217;t know. But his family were really focused on investing in a lot of black startups and black businesses all across the country and across the world actually. So they put up the money for me to build My Artist&#8217;s DNA. And that was my first product, which was supposed to be a way for indie artists to promote and monetize their brands. It came out around the time Myspace stopped and Facebook pages had just launched.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Man. So you go from attending Morehouse where Martin Luther King went to now getting supported by the family of his doctor?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Greatest experience ever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Most people don&#8217;t even know of the Lomax family. They are amazing, amazing people. They have done so much. They&#8217;ve been behind the scenes for so many different things that people don&#8217;t know. And I just am very fortunate enough to have worked with them and they put up real angel money for us to build our first product. I will forever be thankful for them, forever appreciative. And it&#8217;s what really allowed me to get my product design career started. Because prior to this I was doing web design and graphic design, but once we started doing My Artist&#8217;s DNA, that was my first step into actual product design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Wow. So you also worked for a gaming company, is that right? High 5 Games?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Yes. So the startup, My Artist&#8217;s DNA, we did that for about five years, but then we ultimately ran out of funding and I was engaged and knew I needed to get a job again. And then I was in Philadelphia at that moment and I thought to myself, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to do something fun. I want to do something I haven&#8217;t tried before.&#8221; And High 5 Games was a video game company that built casino games for Facebook as well as in house casinos. So I was the art director there and I worked on the marketing team, which allowed me to try to help promote our new games that were coming out and I our new campaigns and come and go. So it was actually my first attempt at working on a growth team because my whole job was to try to create these amazing visuals to keep people wanting to play our games.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
And so you&#8217;re in New York, you&#8217;re working at High 5 Games as art director doing UX stuff. When did you decide to move to Philly? What brought that on?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
So my first move to Philly was when we got the angel investment, because the Lomax family was based out of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
So we needed to be in Philly to be able to get back and forth to the office because they were our investors and we needed to go into the office to be able to talk and help strategize and plan things out. So that was my first stay in Philly. Once that didn&#8217;t happen and I moved back to New York, was High 5 Games, and then I left High 5 Games and went to Philly a second time to work at Comcast, which is extended use cable.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Gotcha.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
That was my second stay in Philly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
What was it like working there?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
I like Philadelphia.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah, Philly&#8217;s a great city. I went for the first time in&#8230; What year was that? 2017 I think? No, not 2017, 2018 I think was the first time I went. Great city. Great city, great food scene. I love Philly. A lot of people was telling me when I went to Philly, &#8220;Philly&#8217;s rough.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Philly?&#8221; I had a great time in Philly. I enjoy Philly.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Philly is rough. Philly is rough, I will be honest. But&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Is rough [inaudible 00:48:01] but that&#8217;s if you go to the wrong place. I think [inaudible 00:48:07] is rough if you go to the wrong places. So what&#8217;s critical about Philly is its proximity to New York and its proximity to DC. It&#8217;s like a middle point between two major cities, so depending on if you&#8217;re in government in DC or if you&#8217;re in banking or real estate or finance in New York, you can even live in Philadelphia and commute to New York as often as you need. That&#8217;s what I was doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
What was it like working at Comcast?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
It was interesting. It was interesting. Why do I say that is because I was a contractor and when you&#8217;re a contractor at these big companies, you get treated a little different. I mean you still go to work every day, but certain company meetings you don&#8217;t get to go to. They had a gym in the building that I couldn&#8217;t use because I was a contractor and you always have this kind of stigma over your head of you&#8217;re a second class citizen because you&#8217;re a contractor. When you can put that aside, which is not that easy, working there was cool because it was the hottest company in the city. I could walk to work. The building and the work environment was amazing. My coworkers were cool. I&#8217;ve actually worked on a lot of high profile stuff. I&#8217;ve got to work on the Netflix release, I&#8217;ve got to work on the Olympic stuff, I&#8217;ve got to work on that new X1 remote.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
I got to work on a lot of projects and different products and I learned a lot. I learned a lot about design systems and I learned a lot about the difference between art directors and creative directors and working with sales teams. It was a really important learning process for me and I learned a lot about things not only design related but just basic work environment related. That&#8217;s what made me realize I never wanted to be per se a contractor again at a company. That stability is not really there and I realized I needed to hone in on my skills and if I wasn&#8217;t going to do entrepreneurship, I needed to get a full time position somewhere because the contracting stuff just gets in the way sometimes. So that kind of clouded my experience at Xfinity a little bit in all transparency.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I worked at AT&#038;T from 2006 to 2008 also as a contractor and yeah, I know what you mean about that second class citizen kind of status. Aside from the fact that they will just treat you in that way, there&#8217;s also the fact that &#8230; and I don&#8217;t know if it was like this at Comcast, but at AT&#038;T they kept changing the goalposts when it came to what they measured you for success by. So the employees were I guess kind of set because they had a salary and so whatever happened happened, but contractors were held to this really super rigid, almost like a Glen Gary, Glen Ross, kind of standard of you have to make this many points a week and if you don&#8217;t make this many points a week, you&#8217;re fired. They would be quick to tell you that they will get someone else in to fill your spot like that. Like they don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Also randomly, if you&#8217;re a contractor and you&#8217;re already feeling some kind of way, being the only black man on the design team doesn&#8217;t really help either, you know what I mean? There were certain times where I just had to really ask myself, &#8220;Is this the right place for me?&#8221; And did I really see myself having upward mobility in that company? Lucky enough, the same guys that I did my first company, myArtistDNA with, they raised another round of money and that&#8217;s when I left Comcast to join their team as head of design at my channel, which is a startup that was focusing on video telecommunications.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nice. How long were you at my channel?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
For about two years. About two years. I started doing a little bit of part time work while I was still at Comcast and then we were making so much progress and the vibe and the energy was good. We were doing well. I just decided to leave and go full time at my channel. That was my second stent at entrepreneurship. Well my third one, honestly</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
So while you were at my channel, right after that was when you decided you wanted to move out West and pursue your career there.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Yeah, there you go. So here we go. Full circle now and all this rambling I did makes sense. We&#8217;re right back to where it all makes sense of how I got here now. But you know what? What I want to honestly say is, and for anyone that&#8217;s listening to this, live your own path, you never know what&#8217;s going to work. Try different things out, make the best decisions you can. We&#8217;re all human. You&#8217;re going to learn so much from every step of the road. Don&#8217;t try to be too perfect because part of life is just figuring things out and I&#8217;m really happy with the path that I took in my life. I don&#8217;t regret any of it and I&#8217;m happy. It led me to where I am now and there was many points in my career that I didn&#8217;t see getting this far in design for whatever was going on at that moment, but also to tie back into some stuff I said earlier, that&#8217;s why you have to be patient with yourself and you have to have self confidence and you have to believe in yourself because you can achieve anything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. You mentioned speaking at AfroTech last year and AfroTech is a huge event. It&#8217;s all about diversity in the tech community. I would say it also ostensibly shifts over into diversity of the design community because design and tech tend to be pretty linked I would say with the tools that people use and things. How do we increase diversity in the design community?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
I think you have to find all the people that&#8217;s interested in it and you have to introduce it to people who may not have thought about it. Awareness is critical. That&#8217;s a really good first step. So let me say awareness, final answer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
And by awareness do you mean just awareness that we are here or just awareness that-</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
That there&#8217;s a actual profession. That there&#8217;s a actual profession that you can go into that&#8217;s not necessarily just called design, but that there is a position title, UX designer, UI designer, writer, UX researcher, product manager, product designer. I don&#8217;t think a lot of people understand the granular levels of careers in tech. You just understand the overarching umbrella of tech and then you may go to the overarching umbrella of design.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
But when I speak of awareness, I want to let a population of people who may not be familiar with this understand all the different disciplines that you can pursue. By doing that you allow people to find what&#8217;s interesting to them as well as what they&#8217;re passionate about. Then by doing that, that&#8217;s how you help somebody make their first step into deciding, &#8220;I actually do want to get into design and I want to be X position.&#8221; But if you don&#8217;t know that there&#8217;s a such thing as a data scientist or as a product designer or as a UI or interaction designer, how are you really going to achieve to want to become one of them?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I mean, having that exposure is important too. To know that this is a potential thing. Sort of like what you said with the granularity. I mean when you and I started out, you were a web designer, you were a graphic designer, you were a webmaster. That&#8217;s pretty much it. And as technology and design have certainly evolved over the years, now you can get so, so specific with the type of design that you do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I do think that makes it harder when you&#8217;re just coming into it, because there are these &#8230; and I don&#8217;t know if you see this too, but like I feel like if you want to get into the design industry, there certainly are paths that you can take that feel like they&#8217;re a little more &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to say reliable than others, but say someone will go to &#8230; they say, &#8220;You know what? I want to get into design.&#8221; So they hear about General Assembly, they go to General Assembly, they take the UX intensive course and I think it&#8217;s 10 or 12 weeks or something like that. They get out, they get placed at a place. Now their UX designer, they hate UX [crosstalk 00:56:37] but they went through it because they felt like that was a way to get in, you know?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Right. See that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m saying they skip that first step of what I said almost 45 minutes ago of figuring out what part of this do you actually like? Don&#8217;t be so caught up in the UX part, be caught up more in &#8230; I liked the way Apple products look. I really like the brand style of that, so that&#8217;s not UX. So you go into UX, I don&#8217;t mean that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re going to do. Really take the time to focus on what you want to do.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
I think that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll decide do you want to really go into a UX program from General Assembly? That might not be the best step for you, but if you don&#8217;t really know what you want to do, I think that&#8217;s where you end up starting to make the decisions that you think might work for you as opposed to what really would work for you. I do agree with you as well that the exposure could bring some layer of complexity, but I also think that it will ultimately lead to a layer of clarity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s a good way to put it. I like that because oftentimes, just knowing that these positions exist is one thing. I think sometimes, to be honest with you, some folks get caught up in the salary. They&#8217;ll see that this place is paying this much and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I got to get into tech. Oh I got to get into design.&#8221; And yeah, there is money if you go with the right company and the right position, but it&#8217;s got to be something that speaks to you, something that speaks to your unique skills and talents and what you like. It shouldn&#8217;t just be about chasing a salary. Because if anything, I think we both know &#8230; I wont say designers are a dime a dozen, but you can be replaced in some way. It&#8217;s not so much about just trying to make sure you get a paycheck at the end of the day.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Right. I mean I agree with you. I agree with you on that. I mean money is definitely important for sure. But there&#8217;s a lot of people that make a lot of money that are not really happy. So if your happiness is important, then money can&#8217;t be the dominant deciding factor because that means you&#8217;ll take the money to work at a company for a position that you&#8217;re not really happy in. I think that ends up having a lot of negative consequences. I would tell anybody, male or female, to fight for the most money you can get, but also understand that there&#8217;s other things that matter when you&#8217;re looking for a career than just the money.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Right. What keeps you motivated and inspired these days?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
I have a family to take care of and my family is really supportive and inspired by me and proud of me and I&#8217;m proud of myself. My growth over my career keeps me motivated. The love and support from my community. Shout out to you honestly, I just hit you up on Twitter and LinkedIn and asked you, &#8221; how do I figure out how to participate in your show one day?&#8221; And you responded to my tweet in honestly less than an hour. You responded to my LinkedIn message in less than 30 minutes so that type of interaction, but that kind of interaction and support, that&#8217;s what keeps me motivated because that means people respect me and that respect goes a long way.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
That respect is what makes you feel good. That respect is what will also cheer you up maybe when you&#8217;re having a bad day. So the respect from my community I would say is what keeps me really motivated. When I say community, I&#8217;m using that as a broad term. I&#8217;m not just using that as the black community or my family. I&#8217;m using it as the design community, the tech community, the Bay area community, my community back in Brooklyn. So my community motivates me, honestly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
What haven&#8217;t you done yet that you want to do in your career?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Well, what I&#8217;ve been doing that&#8217;s been in my last couple of months on, and then I want to thank you as well is more public speaking. A lot of people have told me that they think I could possibly have a lane in speaking. They think I have a motivational style and an inspirational style and I can explain things that could possibly be complicated in a more laymans type of way. And there&#8217;s a lot of value in that.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
I also really liked supporting people and I think speaking allows you to do all that. I would like to do more speaking, shout out to AfroTech. They&#8217;re the ones that really gave me my first, first shot at speaking on such a big platform like that. I had been doing smaller events here and there, but the success of AfroTech is what led me know that I would like to continue doing speaking as well as, I think I want to start some kind of online school to help with training the community to gain the skills that they need to decrease this digital divide gap that I see every day, that I work and participate in design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
One of the themes that we have for this year, that I&#8217;m trying to carry this throughout 2020, is basically how are we as black designers and developers, technologists, et cetera, how are we using the skills that we have to build a more equitable future? Because I mean the future technically is now I think 2020 &#8230; shout out to ABC &#8230; 2020 has been a year that has been in the collective consciousness for over 20 years. [inaudible 01:02:18] show was on ABC, so people have always had a notion of 2020 being like the future. Now that we&#8217;re here and you look at your life, you look at your career, you look at the skills that you have, how are you helping to build a more equitable future?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
I think by supporting other people to become a designer and blazing trails and making sure that I&#8217;m a face of diversity in design. I think there&#8217;s a lot of unique trailblazers and I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m the only trailblazer, but you need trailblazers to be able to bring awareness to situations and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing every day. That&#8217;s what I put 125% into doing that. I also understand and think the value in supporting my community, mentoring, talking to people, going to portfolio interviews. Having one on one calls with people who may reach out to me that have questions about UX and UI. They don&#8217;t know anybody in product design that they can show their portfolio to or just ask a question. I think being that resource for people is really how I can give back the most.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Yes, I can give back through my designs and I make sure to try to bring diversity to my designs and I&#8217;m really proud of that and I love being at Coursera because I can do that and I&#8217;ve seen that. I&#8217;ve seen my power of being able to use people of color on the homepage of Coursera and that&#8217;s a big step for us. That&#8217;s something that I spoke about in my talk at AfroTech. I think those are the ways that I&#8217;m able to actually give back and help.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nice. That&#8217;s funny you mentioned that, that reminds me of Di√≥genes Brito who we had on the show. This was years ago, but he was talking about how he changed the default slack hand to a brown hand and how even just that simple gesture was something that made shockwaves. Just the fact that you see the default hand is not a white hand, it&#8217;s a black hand or a brown hand. What does that mean? You know? It&#8217;s funny, even those little small, or what can seem like small gestures can have a really huge impact like that.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Huge. They&#8217;re huge. I&#8217;ll tell one quick story. When we redid our promo unit platform that I spoke about working on, I was able to sit with some of the designers. They show the flexibility of the new system. One of the days that I logged on coursera.org I saw a brother in one of the new promo units that we just did. And I saw a sister in another promo unit that we did. Then when you looked at another place, there was another person of color on the site and it just really showed diversity and it was a good first step for Coursera and it was an amazing step for me. I don&#8217;t think you really should look at it as was it a big or small step, it&#8217;s a step that is necessary. Shout out to the brother who did the slack hand because that is amazing and shout out to everybody who is making a difference in whatever way that they can because we need everybody to do everything that they can.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? It&#8217;s 2025, what is Fonz working on?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
I think I have become a household name in design as far as a representative from the black community. I think I will have at least my prototype first version of some type of training platform off the ground to be able to help mentor and teach and educate future designers or current designers or people who want to upskill or re-skill. I think I&#8217;ll always still be designing as well. I may have finally launched the app. I&#8217;m thinking about doing some kind of an app that just allows people to have a place to talk and maybe vent and get support. So you&#8217;ll see me probably doing something entrepreneurship wise as well as still being a powerhouse in the design industry somewhere, leading some kind of team to victory.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nice. Well just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
I&#8217;m very active on Twitter. You can find me at Youngfonz, Y-O-U-N-G-F-O-N-Z. You can find me on Instagram at Fonzmoney, F-O-N-Z-M-O-N-E-Y. You can also find me on LinkedIn at Fonz Morris. I&#8217;m not the biggest social media user for gossip, but I am the biggest social media user for networking and print promotion. You can find me on all three of those social media platforms as well as if you just want to see some of the work that I do. You can go to my portfolio which is Fonz, F-O-N-Z.design and you can email me. However you want to try to find me, you can reach out, I&#8217;m online. Trust me, you type Fonz Morris in the Google search bar, you&#8217;ll see me. Hit me up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nice. Well Fonz Morris, I want to thank you so much, so much for coming on the show.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Me too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I mean your energy, I mean for people that don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;m recording this, I&#8217;m recording this after my work day, so after eight hours. Your energy has me pumped now.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
Thank you. I hear such positive feedback from people like that and last night when I was doing the mentoring with the junior designers, I got some same feedback like that. So Maurice, that&#8217;s what I was saying, I think I have a lane in public speaking because my passion for design and my passion for my community and my love for just humanity allows me to be able to share that and bring that energy to the table everyday.</p>
<p><b>Fonz Morris</b>:<br>
So thank you for sharing that with me because those are the type of pieces of feedback that&#8217;s really important to me. I&#8217;m no longer as focused on am I just a good visual designer? I&#8217;m focused on that. And am I a good guy? Am I interesting? Am I exciting? Am I still bringing a lot of energy to the table? So I&#8217;m glad that you were able to receive that from me because I wanted to bring that because I feel really honored and excited to be a part of your podcast. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you sir. I really appreciate it.</p>

<p>Maintaining a creative career these days can be tough, but Terry Biddle makes it look easy. As product design director at DC-based edtech company EVERFI, he helps oversee a lot of UX work while also collaborating with his team to help create lasting social impact for millions of learners every day.</p>
<p>Terry talked about how his love of design came from film and animation, and recalled his time at Howard as an undergrad before continuing at Pratt Institute while holding down a full-time gig. He also spoke on his first design gig once he graduated, his side project <a href="https://www.theknell.tv/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The Knell</a>, and how he created his own typeface under the teaching of the legendary Tony DiSpigna! Terry says he started his design career in a world with no undos, and that kind of determination is what has helped make him a success today!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
My name is Terry Biddle, I&#8217;m a product design director, and I live in Washington DC.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Now, you work for a company called EVERFI, can you tell me a little bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Yeah, EVERFI is an education technology company, just to put it in a nutshell. We make education technology products, so anything that you can think of, as far as online courses, we make them. We make them from kindergarten through 12th grade, for adult learning, for technology companies, for schools, for banks, you name it. That&#8217;s what I do, in a nutshell. I make online courses for all types of learners.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nice. How did you get started there?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
It&#8217;s kind of an interesting tale. So, before I worked at EVERFI, I had my own company, called The Knell, and I sort of got my feet involved in the tech community in Washington DC. And we may get into this a little bit later, but shortly before I was getting ready to start launching The Knell, my CTO left the company, and so, I was left with making a decision that a lot of tech companies have at the time, it&#8217;s , &#8220;All right, now what do I do while we&#8217;re right before launch? Do I keep this going, do I stay active, or do I find myself another job in the tech industry?&#8221; So, I found myself another job in the tech industry, basically, and one of my really good friends in the tech community ended up working at EVERFI, and he said, &#8220;Hey, they have some positions that are open for designers, maybe you should check it out.&#8221; And so, I did, and now I work at EVERFI, and it&#8217;s been a pretty good experience so far.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nice. What kind of projects are you working on now? You mentioned these courses, but in general, what kind of stuff are you working on?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Just to make it really easy for folks to understand, I basically make web applications. I design web applications. We make them for responsive design, of course, so it&#8217;s going to be [inaudible 00:05:41] on web, all in a web platform, like tablet, desktop, mobile phones. So, I lead a small team of designers, international designers. Actually, a lot of the designers that are part of the team that [inaudible 00:05:58] the courses that I help build are based in Argentina, mainly Buenos Ares, Argentina, and we have quite a few designers in the DC office as well. And we also do a lot of communication with our development team, also, just to make sure everything works the way we intend it to work. It&#8217;s really collaborative. UX is really involved, UI design is really involved in the process too. So, it&#8217;s a lot of trial and error, a lot of communication, also, with our content team. We work really closely with our content writers and our instructional designers and our learning experience designers, as well, to craft courses that are going to make sense to learners. So, it&#8217;s really a lot of, &#8220;Okay, does this make sense on this page? All right, now, does this make sense to navigate to that page?&#8221; It&#8217;s really, actually, a good deal of science that goes into it, it&#8217;s not just visual. So, that&#8217;s a lot of what my day to day is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
What&#8217;s the best thing about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
The best thing about what I do. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve thought about it in that way before. I really like collaboration. I would say the best thing about what I do is working with a team of people across all different parts of the product team, that are just&#8230; I work with a lot of really, really smart, super sharp people. I really enjoy, just, the comradery and the communication and just really coming together and solving a problem as a group. I really love that. So, for me, collaboration is a thing that I really take the most enjoyment out of, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Now, I want to get more into your career, including The Knell, that you just mentioned recently, but first, let&#8217;s take it back a little bit. You grew up in Ohio, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s correct. Cincinnati, Ohio, born and raised.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Cincinnati, Ohio, tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Well, it&#8217;s a city on the river. It&#8217;s right across the border from Kentucky on the Ohio river. I like to let folks know that Cincinnati, even though it&#8217;s considered a Northern state, it&#8217;s right on the border of the South, so it&#8217;s the last Southern state in the North, basically, is what I consider Cincinnati to be a lot like. So, you can go to Cincinnati and get good barbecue is what I&#8217;m trying to say.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Uh-huh (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
That surprise you? And what was it to live in Cincinnati? So, growing up in Cincinnati, I lived in Cincinnati proper for the first part of my childhood, and then I ended up moving to the suburbs. My parents are both college educated. My mom was a teacher, so for her, education was super, super, super important. She wanted us to go to school in a district that had higher education standards, so we ended up moving to the suburbs, and now, went from living in an all black neighborhood in Cincinnati, Ohio, to moving to a suburb called Evendale, Ohio. And it was a bit of a culture shock for me, living in an all black neighborhood and then moving to a majority white suburb. It was cool, as far as finding friends. I was a kid, I was eight or nine years old, so finding friends and playing was no big deal to me.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
This was about fourth grade, and in fourth grade, the first school that I went to, it was majority white. I think there were two black children in the entire school that I was going to. It felt a bit out of place. In retrospect, I remember a couple of instances of people saying things that we would definitely consider to be racist now, but it was something that was not considered that back then. And I remember, I had a best friend that I used to play with all the time, and then one day, we stopped playing, and then I found out, later, it was because his parents were racist and they forbid him to play with me anymore.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Oh, damn.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
This was when I was eight years old, so that was probably my first experience with racism and sort of coming to grips with understanding what that was. So, it was a big shock to me, actually, just to experience that because before that, I wasn&#8217;t really aware of&#8230; I mean, you know people look different, but you&#8217;re not really aware that people&#8230; It was my first understanding that, &#8220;Oh, people can just hate me for any reason they want to.&#8221; So, that was my first&#8230; really coming to terms with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. I grew up in Selma, Alabama, so I know all too well, that feeling of people just not liking you, hating you, for whatever reason. I mean, they have a reason, it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re racist, but unfortunately, I know exactly what it is that you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Yeah, and it&#8217;s really weird. I didn&#8217;t even have the faculties to even understand what that was or how to navigate that at the time. Thankfully, it wasn&#8217;t a period that really persisted. I had that happened, and then there are things that happened over the course of it, but I will say that as I was growing up in Cincinnati, I always felt like something wasn&#8217;t&#8230; I didn&#8217;t feel like I belonged. I felt, a lot, I wasn&#8217;t able to be myself. I felt like being myself was seen as being rebellious. And it wasn&#8217;t until I got older and I went to college in Washington DC, and then, eventually, I went to grad school in New York City. It wasn&#8217;t until I was in those places, where I can be myself, anonymous, and nobody cared. It made me realize, &#8220;Oh my God, I can actually be myself and nobody is looking at me, nobody&#8217;s staring at me, nobody&#8217;s making me feel I&#8217;m an outsider.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
I used to dye my hair and stuff when I was in Ohio, I think I dyed my hair red, I used to dye my hair red, and I&#8217;ve bleached it before. I used to have my ears pierced a while, I used to have my ears double-pierced. I had nose ring, I had a labret piercing. I used to do the stuff that a kid does, but me doing it, being a black guy doing it, it was like, &#8220;What is this guy? What is this guy? Is he a freak?&#8221; People would look at me funny, people would assume I was gay. Why would it matter if I was? I wanted to be someplace where I wasn&#8217;t made to feel like I was an other. So, being in DC and being in New York really made me realize like, &#8220;All right, I think I need to move someplace where I can be myself without feeling like I&#8217;m made to feel like another person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
And when you moved to DC, I mean, you went to Howard University for undergrad, which is, I think, probably a great place to find yourself.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Yeah, so there&#8217;s a bit of a story about that too. So, my freshman year of college, I actually went to Columbus College of Art and Design. I got a $20,000 scholarship to Columbus College of Art and Design because I originally wanted to be an animator for Disney, that&#8217;s what I wanted to do. When I graduated from high school. I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be an animator for Disney.&#8221; The Columbus College of Art and Design recruited students from Disney to become animators there, so that&#8217;s why I originally went to the Columbus College of Art and Design. When I went to that school, I found myself in a similar situation that I felt when I had moved from Cincinnati proper to Evendale when I was about eight years old, when I was in fourth grade. I was one of the few black kids there, and it was a really small school. I think it was smaller than my high school. And I felt, again, like I was an other, and it made me feel uncomfortable again, and I wanted to experience what it was like to not feel like an other, to not have no reason&#8230; not to have the most obvious reason for people to segregate themselves from me.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
So, that was why I went to Howard. I applied to Howard and CCAD and got into both. And after I went through my freshman year, I was like, &#8220;All right, let me go to Howard.&#8221; And also, the other part of it was, aside from Disney animation, I wanted to study film a little bit more broadly, so I went to Howard to study radio, TV, film in a more broad fashion, and not just focus on the animation part of it. So, that&#8217;s how I ended up in Washington DC.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay. So, what was your time like at Howard?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Oh man, it was great. I don&#8217;t want to say it was the best years of my life. I don&#8217;t want to say that because every year brings something different. I loved going to Howard. I look fondly on the years that I spent there. I had a lot of good friends, a lot of them I still stay in contact with to this day. It was just a really good experience. It&#8217;s really fortunate, I think, that we live in a time that I think what it means to be black is very different than what it was then. I think a lot of us, we&#8217;re coming into our own with it. I started wearing dreadlocks when I was at Howard, I had dreads all through Howard. I&#8217;m trying to think how many years I had dreads. I had them for a long time. I had them for five or six years straight, then I grew them again for another seven years after that, I-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
And what years were this?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
So, Howard was 97 to 2000.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay, all right.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Yeah, I forgot I have to say the year because-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
No, no, I&#8217;m thinking this is post-</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
[crosstalk 00:15:47] listeners, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
No, no, no, I&#8217;m also thinking this is&#8230; when you talked about, sort of, the different ideas of blacks, I&#8217;m kind of also trying to quantify it within what else is going on in history and pop culture then, so this is post A Different World.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Post A Different World.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
L.A. Riots, that sort of thing, Million Man March, et cetera.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Yeah, in fact, I should probably talk a bit about that because&#8230; So, one of the big thoughts about going to Howard, then, was&#8230; this is when we didn&#8217;t really have any black directors that were mainstream successful at that time. And John Singleton, this was a few years after Boyz n the Hood came out. So, Boyz n the Hood came out and it just blew up the mainstream. Spike Lee was on the scene at the time as well. I should also say John Singleton and I actually had the exact same birthday on January sixth. His death really, really got to me because he was one of the people that I looked up to coming up, in addition to us sharing the same birthday. So, it was really shocking when he passed away.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
But yeah, I mean, this was what pop culture was like. And this is a pre-YouTube world, so when I came to this school&#8230; Google didn&#8217;t exist yet when I started college. Google didn&#8217;t exist, we had a couple of web search engines, I think, at the time. So, this is how far back. So, we had Lycos, WebCrawler, Yoohoo was the most popular at the time, Ask Jeeves. This is what was out at the time, this was a pre-Google world, and we couldn&#8217;t even write papers&#8230; You couldn&#8217;t even use the internet to write papers back then. To do research for papers, we had to go to the library, we had to use floppy disks. This is an area that a lot of folks don&#8217;t even know anything about. Dial up internet, having to download music with dial up internet. Man, I remember sitting in my dorm room, waiting 15 minutes to find tracks on Napster. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;All right, aw man, this track. It&#8217;s only going to be 15 minutes, cool, cool, cool.&#8221; And 15 minutes was an acceptable time to download one song.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
It&#8217;s crazy. Just leave that stuff playing overnight to download an album. Oh my goodness, take me back, take me back now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah, Napster, Kazaa, I think there was one called Audioscrobbler.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Limewire.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Oh, Limewire, all of those. Yeah, I remember that very, very fondly.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Oh my gosh, man. That was the era.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Uh-huh (affirmative). So, you&#8217;re studying at Howard, you graduated in what, 2000, you said?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Graduated in 2000, yeah. I got my undergrad degree in 2000. That was in the School of Communication, shout out to School of C, radio, TV and film. So, my emphasis was mainly in TV and film. That was where the primary area of my study, so there was a lot of screenwriting and TV and film production. And this was back in the day, so we did video editing on Super VHS and Beta video.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
So, what was your next step after&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
S and beta videos.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
So what was your next step after Howard?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Well, my next step after Howard I thought was going to be going into film industry and I couldn&#8217;t quite find a linear path into the film industry back then, the only way to get into the film industry. This was, again this was, everything was analog. I think when I came out of school there was only one mainstream motion picture that was shot on digital video and that was the Phantom Menace. George Lucas&#8217; Star Wars movie was the first, I think, one of the first mainstream movies that were shot on digital video. So it wasn&#8217;t&#8230; Digital video wasn&#8217;t even mainstream at the time. Like now, most things are probably shot with Arri Alexas and Red cameras, that wasn&#8217;t even a thing then. So think back when, what you had to do to break into the mainstream to do filmmaking, you had to shoot on 16 millimeters.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
That was the only way to do it. So it was&#8230; And it was incredibly expensive, I want to say it was about $10,000 a reel to get 60 millimeter film. So it was incredibly expensive and you had to try to get funds like that. So if you were going to try to break into the film industry then, the only way to do it was to be a production assistant, and you really had to be a P.A in New York or LA to do it. I mean from Cincinnati, Ohio, not having any connections in New York city or in LA, I couldn&#8217;t really find a path to do that, I mean it was really difficult. Like they&#8217;d kind of walled you out so you would have crash on buddy&#8217;s couch basically and work for minimum wage or so to do it in New York.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
I didn&#8217;t see that path there. So what I ended up doing after that was, I was always a visual artist. That was the main reason why I went to school in the first place was to be a visual artist, to be an animator. So I was like, all right, so I know how to draw, I knew how to paint, so I should probably go back to school and do something creative as a profession. I need to find some way to use my creativity as profession. And I wasn&#8217;t actually familiar with graphic design at the time, so it was something that I sort of researched and I ultimately, decided to go into studying graphic design as a major for my graduate school. Some crazy stuff go out in between them. This was around 2001 too. Just to give, give your listeners a time frame and this was during, this was around 9/11 so there were quite a lot of stuff that was going on at the time.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
I had sort of made it, I made, I was making a decision. It was&#8230; What do you call it? Where you like&#8230; I was like flipping a coin basically to decide what was the right choice for me to do. So, I had applied for, I had asked for some recommendations from some professors at the time to apply to film school for my master&#8217;s program. But I also was thinking about doing graphic design as my master&#8217;s program.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
And this was right after 9/11 there was I don&#8217;t know if you, if you will remember this or listeners will remember this, but there was Anthrax, there was an Anthrax, a mail scare that happened right after that. And a lot of things were put in the mail and people weren&#8217;t getting their mail in. And I had some packages that were sent out that were supposed to go to schools that just completely got lost in the mail and I never got them. So I wasn&#8217;t able to complete my process. And the other side of the coin was graphic design. So I decided to go back to school to Pratt and studied graphic design there and their grad comd department that was based in Manhattan. So that&#8217;s kind of like a crazy, crazy way. And I ended up at graphic design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
You know, it&#8217;s interesting, there&#8217;s like a&#8230; And maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve had so many people on the show that I sort of followed a similar path but, there&#8217;s like this pipeline between Howard and Hampton to Pratt university or Pratt Institute, I should say, sorry, Pratt Institute. There&#8217;s like this pipeline where people will start out at one of those two schools for undergrad for design and then ended up going to Pratt. Did you find that there were a lot of Howard folks when you were there?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
There were a couple of Howard folks and there were some Hampton folks too. One of my best buddies at Howard as I was a, I&#8217;m sorry, one of my best buddies at Pratt was, it was a Hampton grad. I think they need to stop the Hampton pipeline. You don&#8217;t need any more people from Hampton going to Pratt. That&#8217;s a Hampton joke for folks that don&#8217;t know. And just to be clear on air, Howard university is a real H.U. I don&#8217;t care what anybody tells you. Howard university is the real H.U. just got to be clear about that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I mean, I went to Morehouse, so I don&#8217;t know if I really have anything to say in this whole conversation, but I&#8217;ll let you have that one. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
You probably witnessed the turf Wars.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Oh yeah. So how was Pratt different from Howard, aside from it being, graduate to undergrad? How was it different?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Oh man. I mean it&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t even know how to explain it. There were so completely different experiences. I mean, first I lived in the dorms at Howard, so it was a very, very different at Pratt, I lived in an apartment. I worked a lot while I was in school, so I didn&#8217;t really work full time when I was in undergrad, but I worked almost full time when I was in my Master&#8217;s program. So it was a very, very, very different experience like working in, I lived in Brooklyn when I was at Pratt and I would commute to Manhattan to go to class. So, it was a very, very different, very, very different experience as far as the classroom makeup was of course very different obviously. But there were a lot of international students that at Pratt too, which was really cool.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
It was nice to have different perspectives. We had a lot of students from South Korea that were in our classes, which was really cool to have some international perspective on things where we&#8217;re in class and I don&#8217;t know if I can really talk to the differences because my schooling was so different. I was really doing a lot of TV production and video editing when I was an undergrad. And then I, Pratt was very like, design focused design. I will say that Pratt&#8217;s program was really intense. It was really, really intense. And there were a lot of the big difference I would say that the grad comd department at Pratt, the professors were working full time, so a lot of them were there. They were doing it, they were in involved in the process, like they were actively working in the field. So I think the perspective that we were getting was a very, very different than what you can see sometimes at universities where you know folks are lifelong professors and that&#8217;s what they do full time.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
But having the perspective of being a designer that&#8217;s working is really, really helpful too, for students to understand what market, what the market is and not just, understand what the design principles are. because I mean I&#8217;m just going to be honest, a lot of what we learned in design school, it goes completely out the window when you are working at a big company. It just doesn&#8217;t compute and you&#8217;re going to make, you&#8217;re going to have to make choices that are completely like counter to what you think you learned in design school. And it&#8217;s good to have the perspective of folks that you know that are working to put food on the table that are working to employ other people because they have a different, they&#8217;re going to come at it with a little bit more reality I think sometimes then than what we can learn in a university system.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
That actually is good to know. I mean, I didn&#8217;t go to art school at all, so I was always curious about sort of how much of that transference happens once you graduate and you get out there in the working world, do you feel like it&#8217;s equipped you with the basics or not? So that&#8217;s interesting to know. So right after Pratt, you got your master&#8217;s degree. What was your first design gig after that?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
My first full time design gig was at Reader&#8217;s Digest. I worked at Reader&#8217;s Digest for almost a year. It was, they send a Midtown Manhattan and DC and sorry, Midtown Manhattan in New York city on your Bryant park, which is, I think we&#8217;re good morning America puts on their little music show on the summertime there&#8217;s summer stage. So that was kind of fun walking past there sometimes in the summertime, seeing the shows. Yeah, that was my first gig working in publishing and in Reader&#8217;s Digest, which is really big company, but it was, I really learned a great deal from working there. I got a lot of good jobs. We&#8217;re talking about a lot of back in a day stuff. So let me just let your listeners know what the deal was then.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
So the first program I used Quark 4, to get started and Quark 4 for folks that don&#8217;t know had no undo&#8217;s, zero undo&#8217;s. This is, I started my design career in a world of no undo&#8217;s. So just so folks and understand that Adobe distiller, you had to make a postscript file and then you had to convert that to a PDF. So,that was like the workload back in the day. Adobe distiller, Quark 4 no undo&#8217;s. That&#8217;s how I started my design career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I remember Quark 4 not fondly for that reason. I do remember it though because we used, we used Quark and I think we ended up switching to, maybe it was Adobe PageMaker or something. This one I was, I was probably still in high school at this point. No wait. You said&#8230; What year was this when you were doing this?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
This was 2005</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Oh no. I was out of high school by then. We did use Quark in high school, but it was a previous version that also did not have undo&#8217;s. So I feel your pain there. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Yeah. It was crazy. I mean, you learn, you learn really, really quickly how to, how to make it work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Oh, absolutely. You end up adapting to the situation for sure. Now let&#8217;s talk about The Knell, where did the idea come from to create that?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
It&#8217;s interesting, so like we have, it came from a lot of, we were just talking about, so I came out of school as an undergrad and a pre YouTube world. There wasn&#8217;t any way for the creators of color really to get their work out into the world at the time. When I came out of school and it wasn&#8217;t really easy. But now, I mean, I think when I thought of this idea, vine was still kicking around, YouTube exists or Vimeo exists, but there still wasn&#8217;t quite the pipeline to get creators of color. You know, a moment to shine.I don&#8217;t want to get on a soapbox here, but social media is completely broken in the United States. The way Twitter and Facebook have sort of, so I&#8217;m looking for amplified the loudest voices and it&#8217;s really difficult to be heard outside of the noise and outside and some of that negativity.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
I wanted to try to find a way to create a platform where, marginalized voices would feel like they had a place to showcase their work, but also a place where they could feel safe online without dealing with the idea of harassment. So I wanted to create sort of a video. I wanted to create a video platform that was for marginalized voices and that&#8217;s really what I, how I thought of the idea for The Knell. I wanted to create the platform that I wish existed when I was, coming out of school at Howard. That [inaudible 00:31:02] idea came about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah, I checked out the website and looked at the video. I really liked that kind of bell animation kind of reminds me of almost like afterschool special when they have the little rotating texts or whatever. Like this is a specialist afterschool special announcement or something. I really liked the branding with that. How has it been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Well, I&#8217;m going to be real. I&#8217;m probably going to wrap it up and in the near future it&#8217;s really, really difficult out here for black entrepreneurs to sort of get the key behind, stuff like this. It&#8217;s really hard to find, the funding and to find the people and the manpower to really get your thing off the ground. And I will say that I learned so much from it. I learned a great deal in the tech space from doing it, but it&#8217;s been really, really difficult to get off the ground. And I think it might be a time to put it on the back burner for a while until I can come back to it at another time. Now they&#8217;ve got a full time job and I just, I&#8217;m actually, I have a one year old daughter who just turned one a few days ago. As a matter of fact, being a dad, being a dad man, having a full time job, I&#8217;m going to have to let my other baby chill out for a little bit until I can come back to it in a better, in a better spot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. You have a whole new, a whole new life to take care of though.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Yeah, definitely. She definitely keeps me busy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
With everything that you&#8217;re doing, I mean with work and everything. One thing that really sort of stuck out to me as I was doing my research, and we talked about this a little bit before recording, is that you&#8217;ve created your own typeface. we&#8217;ve had a few typo&#8230;Well, I think we&#8217;ve only had two, two typographers on the site, on the podcast before, but tell me about your typeface and how you came about creating it.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Oh man. Let&#8217;s see. How did I come about this? I&#8217;m like a type geek. Like I was obsessed with typography, when I went to grad school at Pratt. One of my professors was this a gentleman named Tony DiSpigna and I don&#8217;t know if folks know who Tony DiSpigna is, but I Shall let people know that he&#8217;s like one of the, he is a kind of a design legend. He worked for Herb Lubalin, a lot of the type faces that are really popular now, he helped design like ITC lubalin graph, avant garde, Serif Gothic. Those are, I think he&#8217;s credited with creating Serif Gothic. It&#8217;s for, folks, that was one of the type typefaces. I think that was used a lot in the 80&#8217;s I believe even the [inaudible 00:34:01] it and its titles as well.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Hand lettering. So I learned a lot of typographic techniques from Tony DiSpigna and I for my grad school thesis. I did like a really like a type-based thing where I sort of, I did a re-design of the New York city subway system and where I designed a typeface but I studied, it was pre UX. It was like, I did all the legibility tests and all that, all that. So I was really, really into the geekery and the like the science behind legibility and understanding cognition and things like that. And after, having my hands and my getting into really, really nitty gritty type design, I kind of want to do something that was a little bit more fun, more free. I really loved hand lettering. Hand lettering was something I pretty much always did growing up.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
It wasn&#8217;t until I went to Pratt that I found an actual application for understanding how to make typography legible. So I was like, all right, let me just play around with some letters. And I just started drawing these letters, and inking them with an ink brush. And I was like, I really like looks I think my initial ones where I was making a new website for myself and I was just drawing a bunch of type and one of the treatments that I had done with Hamlet or type I really liked and I wanted to take it further. So I just drew it all by hand. I drew every single individual letter out by hand and then I started scanning it in and decided to make a typeface out of it. Now little did I know when I started doing that, how difficult it was going to be from start to finish because it took me several years to actually get it going.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
If I were to put it all together, I would say from start to finish, it probably took about 2 years total to do it. But I sort of stopped in between on the way and then came back to it later on. But it was fun. I mean it was a lot of fun. But then it gets really, really super, super technical after a while and because it&#8217;s a layered typeface. So folks who can&#8217;t see it, the typeface that we&#8217;re talking about is called Bizzle Chizzle. It&#8217;s actually like a series of 4 fonts, but you layer 3 of them on top of each other and they make a dimensional typeface. So it looks like it&#8217;s chiseled out of stone. And when you do that, you have to make sure that each layer lines up exactly perfectly. There was&#8230; After I had designed it and then could submit it to MyFonts for fonts creation and after you submit they give you pointers.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
I&#8217;m like, all right, your [inaudible 00:36:21] off and like, yeah, you need to work on this. And your tracking and all they, they give you all these details about how to get your font ready for commercial release. So did some more tweaking after that. And then low and behold they accepted. It was pretty cool. It was a pretty fun experience. So come back to it and then like I have some typefaces for sale on MyFonts, so that&#8217;s something I can say I did. Oh, that&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Would you ever make another typeface one day?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Oh would make another typeface someday I&#8217;ve made other typefaces. I just haven&#8217;t released them yet. I keep like I have some type of basis that I just use for my own personal use. I made a handwriting typeface that I keep on my computer that I just use from time to time whenever I&#8217;m making a comic type treatment, things like that.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
I might someday expand this set and release it. But it&#8217;s a lot of work to do a typeface. There&#8217;s just so much work and it&#8217;s, it can be a really tedious process. It&#8217;s typical sometimes to find the time to do it, but yeah, I mean I think, I think one day when I&#8217;m like retired on my Island or, or at the beach or something, I might just like crack open, some font software and just like start making some typeface again, when I have some more free time, I can see myself too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. There&#8217;s a typographer we&#8217;ve had on the show. You may have heard of him. His name is Trey Seals. He&#8217;s out there in the D.M.V area. He&#8217;s made a number of different typefaces, mostly centered around, I think like protest signs and protest imagery from the 60&#8217;s and before, but he&#8217;s made a number of different typefaces. I remember when I had him on the show, he talked about how it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s really, it&#8217;s a very painstaking process that goes into it even.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
It&#8217;s a very painstaking process that goes into it, even for something that you would think, oh, there&#8217;s like 26 letters and you know, upper case, lower case, maybe throwing some numbers, some punctuation. There are these glyphs that we see all the time, but we&#8217;d never really think about construction of them because especially in a unified family sort of way, like a typeface.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Yeah, it is painstaking. It&#8217;s a lot of detail that goes into it. It&#8217;s not as easy. Like if you&#8217;re doing something hand handwritten, it&#8217;s not as easy as just like, &#8220;Oh you draw it and you scan it in.&#8221; Well, when you scan it in you&#8217;re going to bring in a lot of artifacts that you have to really clean up for the font software because you have to make it readable by the software that you&#8217;re going to use, so you have to simplify the line work a bit. So it&#8217;s quite a lot that goes into it. I mean some of that nitty gritty stuff though can be the fun part of it once you get into it. The next thing that I want to do is I want to take a crack at making a super family.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
I really love like a type of super families. So I would love to take a crack at doing that at some point. But that&#8217;s, of course, a lot of pains staking work, but one of these days I would love to have a bit of time to really sit down and do it. I love sans serif faces with true italics, man. I want to make a super family. I want to make a sans serif super family with a true italics. So that&#8217;s like one of those things that I&#8217;m going to do on my wishlist.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Alright, and now also as I was doing my research, I saw that you have also been a design educator at an HBCU. You taught at University of District of Columbia. Tell me a little bit about that experience.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Yeah, I mean, I really like teaching, and one of the things that I told myself before I went to grad school, it was one of the big reasons I wanted to go to grad school is that I wanted to be able to teach other students. I think it&#8217;s important to me in particular to sort of give back in a way, to pass knowledge on, to give people insight, and to help them grow in a way that may not have been available to you at the time. I want to be able to do that for other people. So that to me, was one of the main reasons that I really wanted to be a professor. I really love talking about something in class and sort of seeing their eyes light up when you can tell that you&#8217;ve completely blown their mind.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
There&#8217;s just nothing like that, when you see them have this aha moment where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh man!&#8221; Where you can tell that they really got something that you said. And it may not even be something big or something grand, but it&#8217;s something you say and you see them take it in. That&#8217;s really rewarding. It&#8217;s really rewarding to see a student learn. I just love being able to pass that on and really helping folks know their path in the future. So that&#8217;s one of the main drives for me to teach. I really wanted to do that, to give back some of that knowledge and to make a path easier for others.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
What do you think your students teach you?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Everything. I mean, it&#8217;s funny you say that because one of the things that I always say to my students is, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter how old you are, you can always learn something from somebody else,&#8221; and say, &#8220;As much as I would like you to learn from me, I&#8217;m learning from you as well.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
I don&#8217;t think it matters what age you are. You can always learn something new. That was something that I learned from my grandma. My grandma was a voracious reader. She would read always, always, always until the day she died. She was reading, absorbing books and was always up-to-date on what&#8217;s happening in the political environment. I would remember calling my grandma. We talk about politics all the time. She used to watch C-SPAN. I mean my grandma watched C-SPAN 24/7. I think what I love learning from people that are younger than me is just a new way of thinking. There&#8217;s always a new way of thinking, a new way of doing things, and I like to be open to learning something new. You know I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s ever going to be a point in my life where there&#8217;s not something I can learn from someone else.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
I mean, I learn from my daughter every day. Actually, one of the things I learned from my daughter is just what it&#8217;s like to find out what&#8217;s new in the world or just be exposed to what&#8217;s new in the world. That was the coolest thing about now having a really young child is you actually get to witness someone learning something for the first time. Everything to them is new. So it really sort of makes you&#8230; I learned how not to take things for granted in a way by seeing people learn something new every day. It just really keeps you open and makes you really grateful and thankful for what you have.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
When you see how amazing things can be, like when you see the kids&#8217; eyes light up when they see something for the first time, you&#8217;re just like, &#8220;You know what? That is really neat, right? That&#8217;s really cool.&#8221; It is amazing that this sunset is amazing. Those colors are amazing. Like, look at that rainbow. You know, just stuff like that that we&#8217;re just like, &#8220;Alright, keep it moving. Yeah. I&#8217;ve seen that sunset 20,000 times.&#8221; But, you know, if you spend a little extra time looking at that sunset it&#8217;s amazing. There&#8217;s just so much beauty I think that we take for granted, and that&#8217;s something that I think of that I learned from everyone is just how they experienced something&#8230; can always learn something from another person&#8217;s experience with something.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
What keeps you motivated and inspired these days to create?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
What keeps me motivated and inspired these days to create? I don&#8217;t know if I have one particular source. One thing that I usually do is.. What I usually get inspired is something that&#8217;s completely opposite of the thing that I&#8217;m doing. I find that it&#8217;s best to have your head outside of the realm that you&#8217;re in to find something new. Like I don&#8217;t read a lot of design blogs. Back in my younger early career, I used to read all the design blogs. I used to read all about design. I don&#8217;t do that as much anymore. I like to read about tech and science and math, sometimes everything, art, music. That&#8217;s what I do. I read a lot. I love reading. I mean there&#8217;s so many things that you can learn. The reason I like looking at something that&#8217;s completely opposite of what the creative thing is that I&#8217;m doing is that it frees your mind from the thing that you&#8217;re actively trying or problem that you&#8217;re trying to solve.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
And you may find an answer to the problem that you&#8217;re solving in something else. Cause we are all part of&#8230; I mean the world is more interconnected than we often like to think. You know, the golden, I&#8217;m about to throw a design term out, but you know, like the golden ratio. I think about that all the time actually. How many times is that shape replicated throughout the world? You know, in the things that we make, in patterns outside. Everything is connected in some way. So I think a lot of times finding a solution to something or finding inspiration in something comes from outside of the thing and outside of the realm that you&#8217;re in. I think that also keeps your mind open and it keeps your mind open. It doesn&#8217;t block you in to thinking that the answer to what you&#8217;re looking for exists only within your particular realm or only your particular avenue. So for me, it can be anything that&#8217;s not design is really where I look for inspiration. Anything that is not specifically in the design world, I look for inspiration.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
What do you appreciate most about your life right now?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
This one&#8217;s easy for me. Being a new dad is the thing I most appreciate about life right now. There&#8217;s nothing like being a dad. I&#8217;m a first time parent, so I&#8217;m probably gushing more. I&#8217;m sure folks who have more kids who might be listening to this are like, &#8220;Mmhmm, wait till you get to the third one.&#8221; But you know, right now I&#8217;m still in that little baby bliss period. So it&#8217;s really cool to me&#8230; It&#8217;s just nothing like it. It&#8217;s really changed my perspective, being a dad. A lot of the things that I would do, before I had a child or not, the things that I would do now to me my main priority is getting home and seeing my daughter, getting home and having dinner with my daughter and seeing her off the bed or like giving her a bath and things like that. That&#8217;s hands down pretty easy for me right now is spending time with my daughter.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
So one of the themes that we kind of have for the year here, you know it&#8217;s 2020, the whole future is now sort of thing, is like how are you using the skills that you have now to basically do good in the future. So I&#8217;ll ask you this question, how are you helping to build a more equitable future?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Well, I spent a good amount of my life post 2016 with The Knell doing that. That was really my big driver for quite a while. Right now what I&#8217;m doing is I am participating in some groups, company I work for at EVERFI actually, we&#8217;re about to start a mentorship program. So right now I think I am going to be helping the next generation of kids coming up to help them get a foothold in the design and really in the professional world. So mentorship is my next step, I think. I did a little bit of that as professor, but now I&#8217;m going to be able to do a bit of that now where I work and I think that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to be doing for 2020 for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nice. What did you think you were going to be doing five years ago? Like in 2015, what were you thinking you&#8217;d be doing now in 2020?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Man, oh man, that&#8217;s a really interesting question because 2015 was sort of a pivotal year where I was sort of making decisions. What did I think I would be doing right now? I think that I thought that I&#8217;d be doing pretty close to what I&#8217;m doing now, or I&#8217;d be doing something in the entertainment realm. I had another little detour where I did some stand-up comedy, and actually 2015 was interesting because I helped do Washington DC&#8217;s first Comedy Hack Day where I sort of got into or sort of like made a connection to tech. But I&#8217;d also had some connection to the comedy world because I started doing stand-up comedy during that time, so it was sort of like an intersection between my entertainment background and tech. So I would say that I would probably be doing something pretty similar or The Knell in some way right about now. So I think I&#8217;m surprisingly pretty much where I thought I&#8217;d be in 2020.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay. Now to look forward, where do you see yourself in the next five years?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Well, I&#8217;m about to get woo-woo on you. As one of the big changes I had in my life was that I really started to embrace more living in the moment and living in time, so I try not to think too much about what&#8217;s going to happen in the future. But, since you asked the question, there&#8217;s two paths I could see for myself. I love entertainment. I love script writing. One of the reasons I got into comedy back in the day, it wasn&#8217;t back in the day, actually it wasn&#8217;t that long ago, but one of the reasons I got into stand-up was because I love writing and I would love to be as part of a comedy writer&#8217;s room or a TV writer&#8217;s room. So I could see myself back in entertainment doing that.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Or I would love to either have my own company and/or work in the VC realm. I think what&#8217;s most needed in tech right now is a really diverse representation in the VC industry. I&#8217;m saying in order for the tech industry to change more broadly, we need to have more representation in the VC realm, and I would love to see a more even representation amongst women, minorities, LGBTQIA tech folks to really start driving broader change in the tech industry. So I would love to be part of that movement if that movement were to come in the VC realm.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Well, you can find me on TerryBiddle.com and you can also find me on Twitter at TBiddy.com. Not TBiddy.com. TBiddy is my handle on Twitter. You can find me there. I do own TBiddy.com, which I used to use as a URL shortener for Twitter, but you can find me on TerryBiddle.com and on Twitter handle TBiddy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Alright, sounds good. Well, Terry Biddle, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. It&#8217;s funny when we talked about this before, you were saying like, &#8220;Oh there&#8217;s not really something in particular I sort of wanted to discuss,&#8221; but I think as we&#8217;ve heard your story and definitely as we&#8217;ve seen you kind of grow throughout the years just based on what you&#8217;ve told us, it&#8217;s clear that forging your own path to be a creative is not an easy task. And I think that&#8217;s something that a lot of people may forget because creativity from the outside looking in can often look like a very easy thing. Like, &#8220;Oh you just sit around and just come up with ideas all day or you draw all day.&#8221; The things that are attributed to creativity when you&#8217;re a child tend to be discarded as frivolity when you&#8217;re an adult, which I think is really odd.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
But certainly I think what I can draw, and hopefully what others draw from your story, is that carving out a career like this is something that takes time. It&#8217;s not necessarily an easy thing, but I think as long as you have this sort of underlying goal of what it is that you want to put out there in the world that you can really sort of make a name for yourself. And I think certainly you&#8217;re on your way. I mean, even with the typeface, I am blown away by the typeface because I want to make a typeface. I don&#8217;t know how to make typefaces. I too am a type nerd. So you got props from me just for the typeface.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
But overall I think with your startup work with The Knell, your education work, and even the work you&#8217;re doing now through EVERFI, you&#8217;re on your way man. I mean we profiled you for 28 days of the web, so clearly you&#8217;re out here making an impact. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I really do appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Terry Biddle</b>:<br>
Yeah, thanks for having me. I appreciate it.</p>
