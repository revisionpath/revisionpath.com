Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

His projects and overall design work and advocacy have been recognized by Apple, Adobe, AIGA and NPR.</p>
<p><b>May de Castro</b>:<br>
Let me now introduce Roland A. Wiley. He considers himself an urban visionary, whose ultimate goal as an architect is to build cities from the people up. He has over 37 years of experience and is founding partner of the LA-based architectural affirm, RAW International, a nationally-recognized, award-winning studio whose projects range from transit planning to sanctuary design.</p>
<p><b>May de Castro</b>:<br>
He has passionately advocated for the sustainable revitalization of urban communities through both professional and civic activities. Notable projects have included the Union Station Gateway East Portal Building, Motown headquarters in LA and more recently on the planning and design of transformational projects here in the Crenshaw community such as the Crenshaw LAX Transit Project, Leimert Park master planning and Destination Crenshaw. His firm has served in a leadership role in all of these projects with a consistent goal of transforming the physical environment while empowering and preserving the culture of the existing residents. Please help me welcome Maurice Cherry and Roland A. Wiley.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Thank you, May, for that introduction. And thank you all for coming out tonight for this live recording of Revision Path. Roland Wiley, do you prefer Roland Wiley or Roland A. Wiley?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Well, let&#8217;s see, Roland Wiley just because it&#8217;s easier to say, but I like Roland A. Wiley, because those are the initials of our company, RAW.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
RAW International. Gotcha.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay. All right. We&#8217;ll start things off. Roland, tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
My goodness, Maurice, this is a tough one. That would last all hours if&#8230; Let me see where I start. I would start with I&#8217;m a man of God. I&#8217;m a husband, a family man. I have a beautiful wife who&#8217;s here, Andrea. Let&#8217;s give a hand for Andy, my wife. I wouldn&#8217;t be here if it wasn&#8217;t for her. I have two sons, Randall, who&#8217;s 21, and Roland, who&#8217;s 23. I&#8217;m an architect, and being an architect, that is something that is really my passion. I truly enjoy it and it&#8217;s a very tough profession for anybody, but particularly a black man. It&#8217;s a very hard profession.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Well, we&#8217;ll get into that certainly throughout the rest of the interview, but for starters, just tell me about your day-to-day work.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Oh man. We&#8217;ll just start with today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Get to the office at 6:00. I had a large presentation at the Veterans Affair in Westwood. It&#8217;s for a 800-car parking structure. Now, you may think, &#8220;What&#8217;s a parking structure?&#8221;, but a 800-car parking structure is a big deal. There&#8217;s like a room of 12 people, everybody with a different opinion, from administrative to safety, to psychology, to architecture, to landscape architecture. Everybody has an idea, and we are the ones, we are the leaders. We have to direct all of these interests, all of these varying interests into a project that&#8217;s safe, cost-effective, and beautiful. As an architect, that&#8217;s the challenge.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
So after that, I get to the office, and we&#8217;re working on the Beverly Hills City Hall. We&#8217;re renovating the tower at Beverly Hills City Hall. I just find out we get our plan check corrections from Beverly Hills City Hall, and they&#8217;re voluminous, so then I got to wonder, &#8220;Okay, I got to deal with that.&#8221; I&#8217;m leaving town tomorrow, so then I have to plan all of staff to make sure staff is assigned and they know what they&#8217;re going to be doing while I&#8217;m away. In addition to that, there was an employee issue that a long email went out, and I had to be the peacemaker to mitigate whatever feelings were hurt from that email that went out. Then after that, before I got out the door, my CFO made sure I went through all the invoices that had to go out and determine how much we were going to get paid for the month. So it just goes&#8230; Every day is intense. Every day is something. That&#8217;s what keeps you in it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. So some of your current projects that were mentioned in the intro, Destination Crenshaw, Crenshaw LAX Transit Line, can you talk just a little bit about your involvement in those, how those came about?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Yeah, I&#8217;ll go chronologically because the Crenshaw LAX Transit Line, which most of you know, should be opening this year, outstanding the delays. That was somewhat the catalyst to what really energized me as an architect and urban visionary. That was in 1993. We started planning this project in 1993.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s right. So that&#8217;s how long it takes for a transit project to come to reality. That is not an exaggeration. From concept to planning to funding to construction can easily take 20 years. But from that I started to get to understand, to start to envision how transit can transform a community because Crenshaw&#8230; I live in the Crenshaw Corridor. I live in View Park, and I&#8217;ve always been disappointed about the Crenshaw Corridor. The commercial retail infrastructure is so great, but yet the investment is so small.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
The history of that goes back to the white flight in the early &#8217;60s after the Watts riots, where the major commercial retail base disinvested from Crenshaw and moved to the Valley. Then what moved into the Crenshaw Corridor were smaller mom and pop stores, barber shops, hair salons and that kind of thing, but it wasn&#8217;t commensurate to the income of the folks that lived in View Park, Windsor Hills, Baldwin Hills. They had just as much or more income than the people that then moved down into the Valley, so I couldn&#8217;t understand why don&#8217;t we have the same level of goods and services that were there prior.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Then you look at transit investment. A typical transit station probably costs I&#8217;d say about 50 to $75 million just for the station. The entire transit system from Exposition to the airport costs about $2 billion. That&#8217;s a major investment in our community, and at those stations you&#8217;ve spent almost $100 million. You know they ain&#8217;t going to keep a barber shop or a hair salon. You know they&#8217;re going to make some kind of investment. That&#8217;s when the term urban visionary came to me. I started to see, &#8220;Well, this could be so much more than what it is.&#8221; Some of those renderings show what we envision, what our firm envision of how transit can transform a community.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
That went on for from &#8217;93 all the way until today. There are several steps. You have a feasibility study. Then you have a major investment study, then you have a route refinement study, then you have a draft environmental impact study, and then you start to get into preliminary engineering and design and construction. That takes 20 years, and here we are today, 20 something years later, and Crenshaw is about to open.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
But from there you just start to&#8230; Then there&#8217;s spinoff projects, development around the station areas. Then from there, you look at Destination Crenshaw. That&#8217;s how Destination Crenshaw was born. For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Destination Crenshaw is a unapologetically black art program that goes from Crenshaw-Slauson to Leimert Park that was born by Councilman Marqueece Harris-Dawson. He came to my office or he called our office. By the way, he specifically looked for a black architect. Although you think that might be usual, it is not usual. It&#8217;s disappointingly not usual. He wanted a black architect who knew this corridor, and so we worked with Marqueece and Joanne Kim, his deputy. He wanted to make lemon out of lemonade. In other words, that section from Slauson to Crenshaw is at grade and everybody feels they got the short changed by having an at-grade train as opposed to everywhere else is subway. So there was a lot of contention about that.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
The Councilman wanted to make lemonade out of a lemon, and we thought, &#8220;Well look, this is the only place that somebody coming from the airport would see any part of Crenshaw, that section. Everything else is subway. So what can we do to talk about Crenshaw? What can we do to talk about who we are?&#8221; That&#8217;s how we came up with the idea of this lineal art gallery that celebrated black culture, black culture in Los Angeles. There&#8217;s so many people that grew up, that worked, that lived, that learned in the Crenshaw Corridor who are famous, Marvin Gaye, Tina Turner. It just goes on and on, and they&#8217;re not celebrated. They&#8217;re celebrated everywhere else, but not here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
In our community.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Yeah. So that was the idea to represent us in a way that celebrated our culture and people coming from around the world would see it because it would be at grade, people were looking out of the train and they said, &#8220;Well, wait a minute. Why don&#8217;t I get out of here? Why not check it out?&#8221; That&#8217;s, in a quick story, how I became so passionate about transformation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay. Well we&#8217;ll definitely dive a little bit more into those projects as we keep talking, but I&#8217;m curious to know where the spark came from. Where did you first get the notion of like, &#8220;Architecture is a thing that I want to do. I can see the vision of things&#8221;? I want to take it back. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Oh man. I&#8217;m going there tomorrow. Indianapolis, Indiana.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s my hometown. It&#8217;s a great place to grow up. I&#8217;m a proud product of a public schools, public grade school, a public high school. I got a state scholarship that paid my tuition. Ball State University was the only accredited school of architecture in the state. Graduated from Ball State University and came out to Los Angeles immediately after graduation. I always wanted to be an architect. I love buildings even as a child and ironically I still remember the day I discovered I wanted to be an architect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Tell us about it.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
I was with my mom and we had a little Volkswagen. I was about five or six years old. I don&#8217;t know if you guys remember the Volkswagens on the dash had this little rubber handle that you grab onto. I remember I would grab onto the handle and kind of chew on it. I was a kid. I was a kid. I&#8217;d to chew on it and look out the window. I&#8217;d be downtown looking up at the buildings, and I asked my mom&#8230; I said, &#8220;Mom, who makes the most money?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
She said, &#8220;Well, doctors.&#8221; Even then, I knew, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like blood, not going to be a doctor.&#8221; &#8220;And lawyers.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Well, that sounds kind of boring.&#8221; Then she said, &#8220;Architects.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Architects? What&#8217;s an architect?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Well, they build buildings.&#8221; That was it. At that point, I knew I wanted to be an architect because I love buildings. I love the built environment. I love just the energy of a building, just looking at a building and seeing the dialogue it has with you. Every building is saying something. It&#8217;s many times negative, but they&#8217;re all saying something. That&#8217;s where I went.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Roland and I was driving around LA yesterday and we passed by&#8230; I think it was a police station.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Right, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
It had all of these really sharp, jagged, amber rocks outside, sort of like how you would normally see shrubbery or topiaries or something. These were rocks, as if to say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t come here, don&#8217;t sit here,&#8221; or whatever. It was really a odd bit of defensive design.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Like I said, every building, it says something to you. That was in Skid Row by the way. That was, &#8220;Don&#8217;t even think about laying down around here.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s really unfortunate, but that&#8217;s the language. Architecture does have that ability to speak. From that point, I wanted to be an architect, and I was very fortunate to have role models or to see architects who looked like me at a very early age. That was a blessing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
So that was in Indianapolis, you were able to see those role models there?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Yes, I was about fourth grade. We went on a field trip to an architect&#8217;s office. His name was Walter Blackburn. I didn&#8217;t know anything about anything except, &#8220;He&#8217;s an architect and he&#8217;s black and I want to be an architect, so I guess I&#8217;m going to be architect just like him.&#8221; That was a blessing. It really was. I didn&#8217;t know at that time that you don&#8217;t really get to see those role models. That was a very fortunate set of events because in my mind I wanted to be an architect. &#8220;I saw a black architect. I saw his office so what&#8217;s the problem?&#8221;, although there were plenty of people who didn&#8217;t think I could be an architect.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
When I was in high school graduating, my guidance counselor, I told him I wanted to go to architecture school. At that time I had a work-study program where I&#8217;d work. I&#8217;d go to school in the morning. I worked at the city hall in Indianapolis on the 20th floor. My counselor said, &#8220;You got a great job with benefits. What do you want to go to architecture school for?&#8221; I just looked at him. I was like, &#8220;Ah, you know&#8230; But on the serious tip, just think how many young black men have been discouraged from following their dream because they didn&#8217;t see a role model and they had a person of authority that told them they couldn&#8217;t do it. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s disturbing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. You had asked me this yesterday during our drive. No, it wasn&#8217;t during our drive. We were here in Leimert Park. I don&#8217;t remember what the name of the coffee shop was.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Hot and Cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Hot and Cool. Okay, we were at Hot and Cool. You were asking me out of the 300 plus people I&#8217;ve talked to, what&#8217;s one of the common things, and I was telling you it&#8217;s that, that like lack of a role model or a person that they can see that&#8217;s in some position of authority or whatever when they&#8217;re a child or when they&#8217;re in their formative years to say, &#8220;Okay, this is something that I can do myself.&#8221; That seemed to be a very sort of common thread. So that&#8217;s interesting that you were able to kind of have that as an early influence for you. Was it like that also at Ball State when you were studying architecture?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Architecture is&#8230; That&#8217;s where I started to learn it&#8217;s a&#8230; Back then and today, it is a white male elitist profession. The curriculum, you get indoctrinated into the white male elitists and you don&#8217;t even know it. It&#8217;s just defacto. The architects, the classical architects, the modern architects, the cutting edge architects, they were all white male with no exception at that time. That&#8217;s something that to this day disturbs me in terms of the architectural curriculum and how one is indoctrinated into a certain way of thinking where you don&#8217;t see yourself, you don&#8217;t see your culture. You don&#8217;t see a way to express who you are. You have to find a way to fit in and to speak that language when your language is just as relevant, if not more relevant, if given the chance and given the venue to express and to practice it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. It reminds me of&#8230; It&#8217;s an essay by the late Sylvia Harris. It&#8217;s in this anthology from Steven Heller called the Education of a Graphic Designer. She has an essay in there titled Searching for an African-American Design Aesthetic, or I think it&#8217;s a black design aesthetic, but she talks in there mostly about education and how black design students are often learning out of imitation as opposed to kind of like what their culture is about. They learn about Swiss styles and German styles and Dutch styles, etc. But then it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, if I&#8217;m a black design student, are we learning about Nigerian styles or Botswanan styles or South African styles?&#8221; And the answer is no.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Is no. I wonder why is that still today when we have access to the internet. We start to know&#8230; Our history is available, but yet we still don&#8217;t know who we are. When I was at Ball State&#8230; And I don&#8217;t know how or why I did it. I researched the pyramids and the construction of the pyramids and what&#8217;s crazy, I didn&#8217;t realize they were black, the Egyptians were black, because the illustrations that I researched, they were all just&#8230; People drew illustrations of how they were built with white-looking Egyptians. I knew it was in Africa, but it wasn&#8217;t until far after I graduated and I went to Egypt that I saw those folk look like me. They look just like me. We designed those pyramids. Folks that look like me designed structures that far exceed what the classical Greek temples were, that far exceed any monuments that have been built to this day&#8230; Were designed and built by people like me, that looked like me.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
So that opened up a door to me to explore more about, &#8220;Well, what else do I don&#8217;t know? What else have I been indoctrinated and that is not true?&#8221; That&#8217;s the journey I&#8217;m on to this day to discover who we are as a people so that we can express our design aesthetic that comes from our spirit, not that comes from some discipline that you&#8217;ve been given and that you&#8217;ve been taught, but it comes from your spirit. We are very spiritual people, and I think that we are in danger of losing that spiritual connection because we are so busy trying to adapt, adopt and fit in to what popular culture is, which is not us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
When did you end up moving to LA? Was it right after Ball State?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Yep. People ask, &#8220;Well, why did you come to LA?&#8221; I&#8217;ll say, &#8220;You ever been to Indianapolis?&#8221; Hey, anybody from Indy&#8230; It&#8217;s a great place to raise a family. It really is, but in terms of a career in architecture, I can imagine what pigeonhole I might have fallen into in Indianapolis. I just wanted some to be someplace that had warm weather. It was extremely cold.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s fair.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
In Indianapolis. That was just, again, another blessing. I just feel that God has been very good in my life. I had a lot of interviews right out of school. Then a nice little resume and had interviews set up. One of the interviews, it was at Gruen Associates. They&#8217;re an internationally-known architectural firms. They&#8217;re known for inventing the shopping center. I was in the lobby, this great international-style lobby, and this silver-head, caramel-skin woman walks up to me. I thought, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s the secretary of the guy who I&#8217;m going to interview with,&#8221; and she introduces herself, &#8220;I&#8217;m Norma Sklarek, and I&#8217;m going to interview you,&#8221; Norma-</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
&#8230; Sklarek, and I&#8217;m going to interview you. Norma Sklarek is the first black licensed architect in America.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
It was history from there. I mean, of course I was terribly intimidated. She had a New York accent, very nice-looking woman, and she took me back to the studio, a sea of white shirts and white men, and she&#8217;s the boss over them. She walks me down the row, because I did well in the interview. She made an offer.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
The first person she stopped to introduced me to was this young black man named Steve Lott. Steve Lott was just Mr. Cool LA. He was just real cool. I was Mr. Polyester-wearing Country. We became very good friends. He taught me the ways of LA and we became business partners, and we&#8217;re business partners to this day.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nice, nice. What was LA like back then, when you first got here?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Oh, man. I&#8217;ve got to look at Andy. That was before Andy and I got married. LA was live. Back in the late &#8217;70s, &#8217;80s, LA was live, and it was a new experience for me. There was just so much action, so much activity, so much to explore. People, black people, upwardly mobile, interesting, had layers of experience and travel, and the party scene, all of that. It was just happening back then, that back then they had clubs. The Speakeasy, Jackie O&#8217;s, Red Onion, places you could just go. Some of y&#8217;all know what I&#8217;m talking about, but just places you could go and just experience LA.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Then on the other hand, I had friends from all spectrums, so I&#8217;d go backpacking up to Sequoia National Park. I&#8217;d race. I had a friend that had a Porsche, and we&#8217;d go Porsche racing. It&#8217;s just there were so many opportunities that I had no clue about in Indiana, that just this whole wide world was opening up for me, and it was just every day was an adventure.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Then at work, just getting tremendous opportunities. Norma, I think I was a pretty good architect, so if you&#8217;re good, she&#8217;s going to give you a shot. She&#8217;s going to open up some doors for you. Professionally, Norma opened up doors for me and gave me opportunities to work on really good projects, really high-profile projects, and I got a chance to work closely with one of the partners, Allen Rubinstein, and he just opened up more doors for me. I started to make personal relationships with some of his clients, who they just talked to me because I got the job done, and Allen was happy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. What was it like being a black architect then, versus now?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Again, I was blessed because I saw Norma. I was like, &#8220;Okay, I can do this.&#8221; Then in Los Angeles at that time, there were several successful black architectural firms. Bob Kennard, Harold Williams, John Williams, Jack Haywood, Vince Proby, just it went on and on. They were successful because they had political leadership that would advocate for them, that they would tell a developer, &#8220;You are hiring this black architect, end of story.&#8221; There ain&#8217;t no minority or small business.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
No MBE kind of thing?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Yeah. &#8220;You&#8217;re hiring a black architect.&#8221; That enabled black architects to build a really good body of work. They got major county projects, they got major institutional projects, they got major educational projects, because the leadership would advocate for them. Once again, I was very fortunate to see examples of success, examples of black architects who were successful.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Then also, to give honor to Paul Williams, he died the year after I got here. He died in 1980, and I remember the day at Gruen. Somebody walked up to my desk and said, &#8220;Paul Williams just died.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, who&#8217;s Paul Williams?&#8221; They looked at me like I had three eyes. I didn&#8217;t know, and a lot of people didn&#8217;t know. People are only now starting to understand his legacy and his greatness.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
There was always a glass ceiling for black architects, always. However, that glass ceiling was substantially higher than the ceiling for black architects is today, for black architectural firms today. I mentioned that earlier. There are two statistics we need to know about black architects. One is that nationwide, there&#8217;s only 2% of all licensed architects are black. That&#8217;s been the same for 50 years. It&#8217;s stayed at 2% &#8230; is that right, Steve? It&#8217;s for 50 years, 52 years.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Two percent of all licensed architects are black. That is a sobering statistic, but it speaks to the lack of nurturing, the lack of opportunities for black architects. I might go a little further, Maurice, to say that I don&#8217;t blame white society for that. Actually, I blame more black society. We don&#8217;t need white folks to hire us. If black folks would hire us, we&#8217;d be just fine. I believe that situation goes across the board.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
We&#8217;re at this crossroads right now. We&#8217;ve got to turn around and start helping each other. We&#8217;ve got to start reaching back. We&#8217;ve got to start trusting one another. We have to start loving one another, but that&#8217;s all connected to knowing who you are and whose you are and where you come from. That&#8217;s the spiritual aspect that I believe is continually being pushed out of our culture that is essential to our culture, and essential to us being able to come together.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Now, early on, when you introduced yourself, that was the first thing you said. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;I&#8217;m a man of God.&#8221; How does your faith influence your work and the projects that you take on?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Well, number one, it influences me to keep getting up and coming to work, believing that the vision I have for myself, my profession, my career, will happen. It may not happen in my time, but it&#8217;s going to happen as long as I stay under this umbrella of faith, stay under this belief in God, this God-centered life where God is at the top of my life.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
It&#8217;s like a pyramid, where God&#8217;s at the top. My family and my community is at the base, and everything else fits inside that pyramid. As long as I stay within &#8230; I call it an integrity box &#8230; I believe that I will achieve what God has set for me. It&#8217;s a journey of obedience, it&#8217;s a journey of humility, and it&#8217;s a journey of discernment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Something that&#8217;s big right now I think in LA, probably in many other urban areas, is gentrification. Something interesting you said in our earlier conversation we had was that you see gentrification as a catalyst to Afrofuturism. Can you expound on that a bit?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
It goes back to the point I said about a crossroads. We&#8217;re at a very critical point in our society and in our country, and I believe it&#8217;s really dependent upon all of us, especially black people, to break out of this chain we have around our brains and to express ourselves. We are getting pushed out, pushed around, oppressed, and yet you&#8217;ve got the talented tenth that they&#8217;re always going to get theirs, but then you got 90% that aren&#8217;t. This is what&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
I think &#8220;gentrification&#8221; isn&#8217;t a fair word &#8230; but that&#8217;s the word &#8230; because it&#8217;s a negative. There are positive things about gentrification, and Steve talked about good things can happen, but you have to have ways to ensure that we are not displaced from our communities. This right here, Leimert Park, View Park, Baldwin Hills, Windsor Hills, this is one of the last intact black communities in urban America, and we are threatened.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
This, we&#8217;ve seen what happened in Harlem. We&#8217;ve seen what happened in U Street. We need to understand that, and come together with our unlimited creativity and work together to make statements that help to mitigate this term called &#8220;gentrification,&#8221; so that we can have this balance. We can stay in our communities, and other demographics are welcome to come in our community, but this is our community, and we should have a culture that speaks to our community.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s why Leimert Park is so important. It&#8217;s so important to amplify what Leimert Park is. It is the cultural capital of black Los Angeles, and I believe it will set an example to be the cultural capital of black America. There&#8217;s so much potential here in Leimert Park, and it&#8217;s a matter of catalyzing all the potential.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
We have this building here, owned by a black man. Now I&#8217;m getting old. I forgot. Calloway, Fred Calloway. Thank you, Damien. Across the street, Community Build is owned by a black organization. You&#8217;ve got Ben Caldwell and KAOS, black-owned. Then you&#8217;ve got the anchor of Art + Practice. They own about three buildings. Mark Bradford, the internationally-known artist, a black man.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
You&#8217;ve got all of these black ownerships. There&#8217;s a housing project was owned &#8230; well, he sold it, but he&#8217;s a black man, and some of those buildings on 43rd Place are owned by &#8230; black-owned. Well, Fred Calloway owns this whole block, so you&#8217;ve got this opportunity. Across the street, across the street, this parking lot should be black-owned.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
It&#8217;s going to go out for a developer RFP. I&#8217;m going to be the developer. I&#8217;m telling you all that right now. I&#8217;m going to be the developer for this site across the street, and it&#8217;s going to be an African American cultural and conference center that celebrates our culture, that talks about our history. From whether you want to know the Hebrew history, the African history, the Moorish history, all of the rich history that we have that we don&#8217;t celebrate, that many of us don&#8217;t even know.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
We don&#8217;t even know our roots before slavery, which are deep and important, that define us, but we don&#8217;t know. Once we do know, I tell you, that&#8217;s when we&#8217;re going to have our power. When we know who we are, when God reveals to us who we are and whose we are, that&#8217;s when the power&#8217;s going to happen, and that&#8217;s when you&#8217;re going to see tremendous change.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Right. Right. Absolutely. We&#8217;ve been seeing some of your projects here, cycling behind us as we&#8217;ve been talking. When you look back at the portfolio of work that you&#8217;ve done, is there one project in particular that really stands out to you as being your signature project?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Not yet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Not yet?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s easy to say. That&#8217;s one of my biggest struggles, is my body of work, and the only comfort I have is that architects don&#8217;t really reach their stride until they get in their sixties and seventies. That&#8217;s my comfort, is, as you know, the best is yet to come, and that cultural conference center across the street. I feel very good about the future, my experience and my body of work. I&#8217;ve had a lot of great projects. Destination Crenshaw was a great experience.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
I got to work with Nipsey Hussle. I was there the night that the name Destination Crenshaw was born. View Park Prep, the new school, the middle school. We had a community meeting, and Nipsey Hussle had agreed to be there. The whole school showed up, and then more people. There ain&#8217;t never been no kids show up at a community meeting. The whole school showed up. We had captured them, and we got some great ideas from them about what this project could be.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important for us to build that bridge with our young people. They&#8217;re the ones that came up with the idea to call it #DestinationCrenshaw, because they wanted to make it a &#8230; again, I&#8217;m not a social media person, but they wanted to have it as social media, and it was born out of their vision, out of their understanding of where we are today.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
They had that kind of vision, that creative vision of social media, and we have that knowledge of architecture, planning, infrastructure. That&#8217;s where I think that the power is going to be, when we come together, the two generations.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s shift gears a little bit. There&#8217;s an anecdote that you told me yesterday while we were riding around about Muhammad Ali. You can share the anecdote if you want to, but as a lead-in to that, who have been some of the people that have really inspired you throughout your career?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Norma Sklarek. She was one of the first people that I was just in awe of. Actually, my two business partners, Steve Lott and Steve Lewis. Steve Lott is one of the most talented men I know, and Steve Lewis is one of the nicest men that I know, and talented. Between the two, I grab something from both of them and try to be who I am.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
There have been men. My dad played the most, the influence in my life of being a good man and being honest. He got up, he went to work every day. He took care of his family and never failed. I got the benefit of seeing that, seeing how a man models manhood. No matter how he was discriminated against &#8230; he came from the South &#8230; even in his job, he still kept doing what he did. That inspired me to just keep getting up. There&#8217;s always going to be disappointment. There&#8217;s always going to be discrimination.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Then Muhammad Ali, Muhammad Ali, as a young man I observed him, and I was so impressed by how you couldn&#8217;t stop him. He was so confident and so arrogant, to a point, but he believed in himself. You have to be that way in order to win, to fight that fight. Even though they took away his belt, he kept fighting. Even though they prosecuted him and tried to hold him down, he kept fighting. He sacrificed. He sacrificed his life for what he believed in. He sacrificed his livelihood for what he believed in. That&#8217;s something that&#8217;s very important to me.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
I think as all of us get into the business world, you have to be careful not to compromise, because your integrity is so important. As you get older and you start to maybe enjoy some success, you want to have that success with some integrity. That&#8217;s what I saw in Muhammad Ali. That&#8217;s what I saw in some of the older athletes, but particularly Muhammad Ali, and it&#8217;s just always stayed with me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Do your sons want to follow in your footsteps?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
No. They want to follow in my footsteps in terms of being a businessman, but they see how hard I work, and they see that, &#8220;Hey, where&#8217;s the money?&#8221; The kids, they&#8217;re about getting paid. They&#8217;re about getting paid and not working hard and having fun.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Sounds about right.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
It&#8217;s a whole nother kind of value system that the millennials and the &#8230; whatever the other generations, you call them, but it&#8217;s very digitally based, and they just work from a different paradigm. Both of my sons definitely have high ambitions and they want to do well in life, and they would be interested in working with me if I&#8217;m able to turn the corner and turn an architectural firm, a traditional architectural firm, into something that is nontraditional, that speaks to some of the community-building that I&#8217;m talking about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay. That&#8217;s interesting to hear. We have a lot of designers here in the room, of course. This is AIGA, American Institute of Graphic Arts, all that jazz. What advice would you give to designers that are looking to use their skills and their gifts for I want to say community activism? Because I feel like a lot of the work that you&#8217;re doing is putting back into the community. You&#8217;re making and creating these built spaces that not only celebrate the community, but also it gives it a place. It gives it a marker of some sort. What advice would you give for someone that wants to follow in that same fashion?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
The first thing I would say is believe in yourself. Whatever it is that&#8217;s in your heart that you&#8217;re passionate about, you&#8217;ve got to believe in yourself, because the world is going to try to tell you different. The world is going to try to make you conform to what they think you should be, whatever demographic you fit in. Believing in yourself is number one, and give back. You&#8217;ve got to give back. It&#8217;s so important to give back. To share your gifts is so important.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
I think if you do those two things, things will start happening, because when you&#8217;re giving back, things happen. Doors open, opportunities come. I mean, this opportunity, Terry Scott, because I&#8217;m in Leimert Park giving, and Terry just said, &#8220;Hey, talk to Roland,&#8221; and here I am.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. I mean, we were around here yesterday again. We were at the coffee shop, and I got to see it in action. I mean, every person out here came and shook your hand and you talked with them. I think you even talked someone down that was having a bad day and everything. It&#8217;s amazing how much you&#8217;re a part of this community and how much you give back to it. It really establishes you as being, I mean, well, one of the community, but also someone that cares about where the community goes in the future.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Yeah. Well, I just think that&#8217;s important, and everybody &#8230; I can see you asked me for that advice. Everybody, everybody, has a way of giving back. Your way may not be coming to Leimert Park, dealing with homeless people and stuff like that, but everybody can give back. Everybody has a way, has a gift to share and to give back.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
What&#8217;s been the most important lesson of your career?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Man. My goodness. I think that&#8217;s very interesting. The most important part of my career I think is my constitution of integrity, because there have been some tough decisions, and I&#8217;ve made the decision based on integrity although it was extremely tempting to go the other way, and I chose integrity. Now, it certainly didn&#8217;t help my bank account, but I chose integrity, and I have peace. I think peace is the most important thing that a man or a woman can have in their life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Now, all of your projects, at least from the ones that are cycling behind us and Destination Crenshaw and the others that you mentioned, they have these very long timelines, so maybe this question might not apply, but I&#8217;ll ask anyway. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? It&#8217;s 2025. What do you see yourself working on?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
I see this cultural conference center just being completed. It&#8217;s a five-year plan. We&#8217;re in the second month of that five-year plan. I see two years spent getting financing and getting the right financial proforma funders, partners, all of that lined up, and then a three-year construction project. Our offices are downtown. My lease expires in five years. I plan on having my office on the top floor &#8230; it&#8217;s going to be a five-story structure &#8230; of this cultural conference center.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
I plan on using that as an example to encourage communities across the country on how to pool their resources together, and not trust or depend on government or any charitable venues, but to be self-supporting and have a level of self-determination. My wife doesn&#8217;t like that, that term &#8220;self-determination,&#8221; but the fact of putting it all together with your own resources.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
I use Booker T. Washington as an example. Back in the day, there was this clash, if you will. They like to divide us. Back then it was Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois. Then it was Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. Booker T. Washington started the first architectural school at Tuskegee, and his whole curriculum was designing, construction, maintaining, building, making the bricks, understanding the whole cycle of building construction. That&#8217;s when an architect was a master builder. That was the first black architectural school.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
The second school was Howard University, and Howard University, one of the leaders was W.E.B. Du Bois. Howard University needed federal funding to fund the school, so they had to act like the traditional white architect, who is don&#8217;t roll up your sleeves, white shirt. Don&#8217;t get your hands dirty, just design. Unfortunately, that school of thought became prevalent in all of the black schools of architecture. We melded in with the traditional white male elitist form of practicing, and that&#8217;s not who we are. Emulating. We wanted to so much be like them, and so here we are, 2%.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s what we want to do with this cultural conference center, is build it, manage it, maintain it. There&#8217;ll be a catering kitchen. Partner with LA Trade Tech. Build jobs. Have people having a sense of ownership to this project, and offer public shares. The community can buy shares into it, because it&#8217;s not a charity. It&#8217;s a profit. There&#8217;s revenue streams.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
We want to make something that people can feel they own, people can feel that they&#8217;re getting paid, and it&#8217;s being a source of jobs. We just didn&#8217;t get that. Architecture school just teaches you how to build pretty buildings. Then on top of that, only 10% get to do that.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
And then on top of that, only 10% get to do that. I think the whole education, architecture education process particularly for black architects needs to change.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Do you think black architects can design like white architects?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
We try and you see where that&#8217;s getting us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Well, okay, look around. Somebody point out a building that was designed by a black architect and that&#8217;s probably a nice building. My point is there ain&#8217;t a whole lot. And if you look around the city scape today, you drive up and down Crenshaw, all these new buildings going up. I&#8217;m a be safe to say one of them was designed by a black architect. I don&#8217;t know if it was, but I&#8217;ll just be safe. I would say none. Now that&#8217;s a horrible statement. But we&#8217;re trying so hard to be like them and sometimes I think they just laughing at us because we&#8217;re not moving forward.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
We&#8217;ve got to come together and understand it&#8217;s about us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
And we don&#8217;t need them, it&#8217;s everybody else is all good. But we need to start supporting us. We need to start loving us. But then it goes right back to we don&#8217;t know who we are and that&#8217;s what this cultural conference center, the concept of it is to teach us who we are. This is a place of learning. We are broken people. We have 400 years of slavery, oppression, affliction. We&#8217;re traumatized and we&#8217;re sitting around here not recognizing it. The end result is where we are. And so to understand that and it&#8217;s biblically based. If you read the Bible and not look at it as a myth, but look at it as a history book and don&#8217;t allow society to marginalize it because the moral trends of society today think the Bible is old fashioned and you should just do what you want to do.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s very dangerous because the Bible is our history and that&#8217;s a paradigm that many of us don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s not just Jesus was black, it&#8217;s all of them was black in the Bible. If you go back to biblical times and look at what did people look like-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
&#8230; thousands of years ago in Israel, in Persia, in Syria, they look like us. When you read the Bible, you reading about people that look like us. We don&#8217;t recognize that. If we knew that, that&#8217;s where the power is and that&#8217;s why I have peace. My wife, she&#8217;s much more aggressive about it. I don&#8217;t have time, the people I started talking about it, eyes started glazing over. I like, &#8220;God&#8217;s might have to touch you because I am going to drop the seed and I&#8217;m moving on. I got to get paid. I got work to do.&#8221; I know that&#8217;s selfish. I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
I&#8217;ll do better, my wife&#8217;s going to make me do better.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Oh, bro this has been a great conversation. Again, I want to thank you for just sharing about your work and about your life. Where can people find out more about you and about your projects and what you&#8217;re doing?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Www.rawinternational.com. It&#8217;s a very outdated website that needs help. I&#8217;m happy to get your coWww.rawinternational.com.mments. We have the Leimert Park Village, Terry, www.leimertparkvillage.org , we&#8217;ll talk about the cultural conference center. But that&#8217;s one of the things, my goal is to get better with social media and understand the digital age a lot more, I need to do better with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Well, I mean I think certainly with this work that you&#8217;re doing that&#8217;s making these big public spaces and everything, the word will get out there. So being ahead of it will help a lot I think.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. Well I mean that&#8217;s the conversation I want to thank you Roland so much for coming on the show for sharing your story. When you were introduced as an urban visionary, I really saw it yesterday when we rode around for people that are listening. We rode around LA and you showed me View Park and I think it was the view coming down towards St. Bernadette&#8217;s Church, I believe-</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
The Catholic school on Stock, not Don Philippe, Don Philippe, and I forgot the cross street-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I&#8217;ve never seen a view like that. And when I think of the term urban visionary, it makes me think for you that you probably see so many spaces, you see the possibility. You can look at the empty lot and see what can come up there. You can look at maybe the blighted building and see what it should be. And I feel more of that is what&#8217;s needed as we progressed into the future. Because certainly, LA is a big city, LA is a overpopulated city and so there&#8217;s going to be a need to have more spaces that are not just for us, but also to help make sure that we have an equitable future. And I think it&#8217;s really great that you&#8217;re one of the Vanguards of helping to make that happen. So thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Well thank you Maurice. And I do want to also congratulate you on your achievement with the Smithsonian and I know your mom is very proud of you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Oh, thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
All right, so where&#8217;s my, I think we have-</p>
<p><b>May de Castro</b>:<br>
Time for Q and A, if anybody has any questions, if you can just come up here please.</p>
<p><b>Speaker 2</b>:<br>
Two things real quick. One, just to clarify a point of correction about Norma. She was the first black licensed female architect in California. The other thing is the constant return to how we have been victims of miseducation or under education. How important do you feel inculcating our true histories authentically told by us today into curriculum would be in freeing, just providing that knowledge that you feel is essential for particularly our young people to go beyond where they&#8217;ve been able to go so far?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Well, I have a simple theory about imagery, and television, and education. It&#8217;s all about inspiring people. And I think the majority demographics get inspired all day long, reading history about their history and their achievements and they&#8217;re just all good. But it&#8217;s rare that we, and particularly in architecture, read about our success, our journey, our knowledge. So I think just by showing and illustrating those kinds of success stories, even something about Norma, something about Paul Williams, that&#8217;s in our curriculum, that it starts to, young people will just be automatically have that kind of impression that, &#8220;Oh, okay, somebody like me is doing it. I want, I know I could do that.&#8221; So that&#8217;s where I see that need in education.</p>
<p><b>Speaker 3</b>:<br>
First, I&#8217;m going to give you props in your shoes with some sick shoes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
They are some nice shoes.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
My son gave them to me for Christmas, I was like, &#8220;These are bad.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Speaker 3</b>:<br>
He has good taste. You mentioned earlier about how building will speak different things to you and [inaudible 00:57:31] project would take years and years. How do you maintain keeping your vision along with not getting lost with politics or things like that on during a project?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
One of the things that keeps me motivated on these long projects is to have in the queue more projects. Crenshaw is opening this year, hopefully. We&#8217;re working on the West Side extension, which is a subway to the C under Wilshire Boulevard, that&#8217;s not going to open for another six years, but see that&#8217;s in the queue and you think the Crenshaw project is going to be transformative, watch this Wilshire project. The Wilshire Corridor is going to just explode. You&#8217;re going to see high rises. It&#8217;s going to be like New York. Now it may take 10, 20 years, but you look 20 years from now, the Wilshire Corridor between say LaBrea and Beverly Hills, it&#8217;s going to look like New York. It is going to look like New York. And so those are the kinds of things that keep me motivated. We&#8217;re also doing the planning for the Crenshaw North project, which means it&#8217;s going, the Crenshaw line will extend from Exposition all the way up into Hollywood. That&#8217;s going to be transformative. So to have the opportunity to be a vision and all of this transformation, that just gives me, 10 years goes by and it just keeps going.</p>
<p><b>Alison</b>:<br>
Thank you so much for being here. When I first went to school, I went to Columbia in Chicago and I was going for interior architecture and I didn&#8217;t see anybody who looked like me. So I wound up being a project manager for eight years. So I was burned out and pushed out by the ivory tower of it all. And now that I&#8217;m doing my own thing, how do you see people like me who are not necessarily of this neighborhood but are of this people I want to be able to give back, but how do we stop thinking that blackness is this one monolith because I don&#8217;t fit in, or I don&#8217;t look like you, or I don&#8217;t have your experience for us to be able to come together and be accepted into these neighborhoods which maybe we haven&#8217;t been from originally but are a part of because of our culture.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative). The first, I&#8217;m sorry, what is your name?</p>
<p><b>Alison</b>:<br>
Alison.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Alison. One thing I would recommend is to be active in organizations, cultural organizations, professional organizations and I stress the word active.NOMA, the National Organization of Minority Architects, every year we have a project pipeline, it&#8217;s a summer camp to introduce young kids to architecture. To just be involved in that and then it&#8217;s just doors start to open, you start to meet people, you start to network. Leimert Park has, we love Leimert Park, and that&#8217;s young people like you that are promoting Leimert Park. You have to search, but once you get in, then you start to see this network, but that&#8217;s what I would really, really encourage you to do. Even if you just start with NOMA, that it just branches from there. LA has a tremendous network of black folks who are actively trying to make a difference in a positive boy.</p>
<p><b>Speaker 4</b>:<br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Here&#8217;s Shaw.</p>
<p><b>Speaker 4</b>:<br>
Here is the next question. Based on all of your years of studying architecture, what life philosophies, understandings about life, about people have you gained over time? What have you created? What else ideas do you share with people based on the ideas of architecture?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s deep. Number one, philosophy. Number one, you never give up. You never give up. Number two, I see the humanity of everybody. I see the human person first and I think that&#8217;s important, whether white, black, brown, yellow, whatever. I look for the humanity in a person. I&#8217;m from, I think it&#8217;s a Midwestern thing where you give people the benefit of the doubt. Just because you&#8217;re white, I&#8217;m not thinking, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re a bad person,&#8221; or anything like that. I look at their eyes, I feel their spirit and then I listen. So I think that&#8217;s, and it gives me a sense of confidence in any place that I go, that I look for the humanity in a person and then I go from there. It&#8217;s really simple. I don&#8217;t have a complex set of rules or, I really base my life on biblical principle. I follow my passion. There&#8217;s something in everybody that you know, you know, that&#8217;s what you want to do and it doesn&#8217;t matter that well maybe it&#8217;s not going to make a lot of money or maybe everybody else isn&#8217;t doing it. If that&#8217;s what you want to do, if that&#8217;s where your passion is driving you, you should continue to pursue it.</p>
<p><b>Speaker 5</b>:<br>
How you doing Roland? Thank you so much for you both doing this and for the center for doing this. I have two questions. One is short, one requires detail. The first one, what pushback, if any, have you experienced when it comes to using more sustainable materials? And things like containers, shipping containers or recycled materials when it comes to actually contributing to that structure. Because I know there is pushback. And then the second part of the question is what push back have you experienced when it comes to making our cities look futuristic? You know what I&#8217;m talking about? So can you speak to that for a little bit?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Yeah. The first question, sustainable materials, two things, cost and logistics. Costs is simple but with sustainable materials, there&#8217;s a brother here today, Richard Tim, and he has a system of glass. It&#8217;s not solar panels, but this glass can transform into electric energy. And so I was immediately intrigued and interested however my question is cost. And so he gave me the answer that it can pay for itself and plus tax incentives. And then the second question is logistics. Logistics from an architectural perspective is UL rating, ICBO number, research report number, has it been used before? What are some of the drawbacks that you don&#8217;t know about yet? So those are the two major push backs, if you will. It takes innovation and courage to take that step. I definitely want to follow up with Tim, number one, because he&#8217;s a brother and I&#8230; Anyway, I can help a brother who&#8217;s, and that&#8217;s another thing. If you see a brother or sister is about something positive, y&#8217;all got to open up a door.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Amen to that. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s just what we should be doing. Now, the second question, repeat that second question again.</p>
<p><b>Speaker 5</b>:<br>
I feel like our cities are not looking how they should look in a 2020 vision, right? Promised flying cars in year 2000 right? We have those, but they&#8217;re not readily available.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Okay. So great.You laugh about flying cars, but I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m going to go back to what I&#8217;ve been talking about since 1989 and that&#8217;s autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p><b>Speaker 5</b>:<br>
There it is.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
These autonomous vehicle technology has been in place since 1989. You know why we don&#8217;t see it yet besides people being scared, but that&#8217;s not the reason.</p>
<p><b>Speaker 5</b>:<br>
It&#8217;s money.</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Insurance companies can&#8217;t get paid, auto mechanics, can&#8217;t get paid, taxi drivers can&#8217;t get paid. All these people, drivers unions don&#8217;t get paid. All these people to stand in line, not to get paid are blocking. And that&#8217;s what happens with technology. Now when a crisis happens, then people start getting out of the way. But right now that kind of technology, futuristic technology is here, it&#8217;s just there are competing interests that stand, they ain&#8217;t going to get paid. So what I&#8217;m figuring is they&#8217;re making deals with the insurance companies now, they&#8217;re making deals with the truck drivers union so they can share and somehow these can move forward.</p>
<p><b>Michael</b>:<br>
Well thank you for doing this tonight, man. It&#8217;s always a pleasure to listen to you and you sharing your passion and your knowledge is really important. I had a question that goes to something where your notion of your community center and the fact that you&#8217;ve talked about having it be a sustainable operation. What do you think? And you can look forward maybe another 10 years, what do you think is going to happen in terms of ownership in the broader community here? Because you see it changing right now and how does this community look like it does today if you don&#8217;t own it?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Well, the truth is Michael, that this place is going to look different 10 years from now. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that our culture should not be the predominant culture. I&#8217;m a true believer in an open society and I am very, very pro-black, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m anti anything. I&#8217;m just unapologetically black. I think that if we continue to promote our culture and we continue to ensure that projects like Destination Crenshaw are implemented, projects like that Cultural Conference Center are implemented, that we patronize our black businesses to sustain them. I think ]that we&#8217;re going to be fine. I just think it&#8217;s going to be different. But to me that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>
<p><b>Alison</b>:<br>
So I guess to follow up with that question of what does the future look like, sustainable materials, how do we get young black people to understand urban planning, and transit, and things like community land trusts? How do we get us to get together to understand all of these things and to understand parking is a huge issue when we&#8217;re talking about housing for the one-to-one? For every unit that needs to be built, there needs to be a parking space for it. How do we do that? How do we put that education into our landscape?</p>
<p><b>Roland A. Wiley</b>:<br>
Community activism is very important. You talked about [inaudible 01:07:54] community land trust. The owner of this space, Mr. Damian Goodman is one of the largest voices about community land trust and advocating for our community. We have to rally around leaders who are willing to be a voice. And I think one thing that we have to know that there&#8217;s power in numbers. Our electeds, they pay attention when they see numbers. If they just see Damien&#8217;s voice, that&#8217;s Damien, but if they see Damien and 2000 other people, then they&#8217;re going to start listening. I think it&#8217;s very important that we do rally around folks like Damien who have a vision, who have a true heart to improve our communities, and we be a voice. We sign the petitions, we make the phone calls, we show up at the meetings and this is just community 101. You go to any other community in it, I can promise you that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on and it&#8217;s just that we need to adopt that culture. Again, that comes to that whole realization or that revelation if you will, of who we are.</p>

<p>For Jailyn Easley, combining design and technology with her work is like second nature. As a member of Accenture&#8217;s experience design team, Jailyn uses her phenomenal design skills with cutting edge tech like machine learning and mixed reality to create next-level work. But her journey as a designer doesn&#8217;t stop there!</p>
<p>We began our conversation talking about Jailyn&#8217;s brand design work with the popular Atlanta restaurant Slutty Vegan, and she shared how growing up in Baltimore and working with and being taught by luminary Black designers <a href="/leon-lawrence-iii/" data-wpel-link="internal">Leon Lawrence III</a> and <a href="/jennifer-white-johnson/" data-wpel-link="internal">Jennifer White-Johnson</a> helped hone her design skills and put her on a path to continuing her studies in Atlanta. We also spoke on Atlanta&#8217;s growing status as a creative hub, and she shed some light on her latest project titled 100 Days of Design. You&#8217;ll definitely want to keep an eye out for Jailyn &#8212; her star is on the rise!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
All right, so tell us who you and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
My name is Jailyn Easley and I am a Baltimore race creative now currently living and working here in Atlanta. I specialize in design strategy and interactive designs, so I like to do a lot of things that are dealing with just different design trends and things that are going on currently as well as emerging technologies that some people may have heard of such as MR, Mixed Reality or VR, certain things like that. And I like combining the two worlds to see the different possibilities or opportunities that we&#8217;re able to reach.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nice. And now you just recently started at Accenture, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Yes, back in October, yep.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay. What&#8217;s an average day like for you there?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
So at Accenture I work in our innovation hub, which is the largest office in the Southeast region. I currently do experience design, so I help support our internal teams and whenever we have different clients that come in that want some sort of consulting workup done, we help support those pods that do mainly more of the strategy and business side of things. So they&#8217;re the ones helping close the deals and everything while we&#8217;re on the back end doing all the visual assets.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
If a different client comes in, then we would make all types of assets, everything from digital signage to say welcome to that company name badges. We would do PowerPoint decks and we kind of come up with the theme around what the visual looks like for when that company comes in to do that workshop. So it&#8217;s a pretty interesting time. I get to learn a lot of different technologies and softwares and things like that. For example, I&#8217;m working in [inaudible 00:04:45] right now, which is kind of interesting because I never thought I would be actually doing real motion design stuff. So it&#8217;s pretty &#8230; It definitely pushes the limits when it comes to combining technology and design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nice. It sounds like it&#8217;s pretty fun so far.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s awesome. I love Accenture. There&#8217;s so much to offer there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I would imagine working in some place called like the innovation hub, that sounds very next level futuristic kind of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Yeah, we definitely, there&#8217;s so many things that Accenture is working on in house and just their dealings with other companies and things like that. We get a chance to put our hands in every little pot. So for example, we have a 360 camera that we&#8217;re testing out right now to see how we can use it within some of the workshops and helping to get that innovation piece, I guess, to the clients or communicated well to the clients so that they can see that part of Accenture as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
What drew you to working for Accenture?</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
I think just the way that their company is progressing. They&#8217;re definitely not a brand new company, but a lot of the things that they&#8217;re doing in the market, they&#8217;re definitely dominating and being able to push the limits when it comes to thinking outside the box honestly. Because so many different problems to solve that we&#8217;ve done on the job and it&#8217;s just like whatever the client comes in for, we always find a really interesting way to problem solve around it. Honestly, coming out of SCAD, something that I wanted to do was being able to combine strategy and design. I liked the concept thing around designing and coming up with the theme and the abstract for it and everything like that. So I really was kind of drawn to that strategy and that consulting so to speak side of Accenture, so that&#8217;s definitely something that drew me forward to them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
And now for those that are listening and may not know specifically what experience design is or why you would combine strategy, which is something that&#8217;s probably more left brain cerebral with design, which is more right brain and creative, can you talk a little bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Accenture has a few different necks when it comes to their overall brand. So they have an Accenture strategy, they have an Accenture interactive, but I think the interesting part about that is that they co-create in one space. So definitely the importance to that, we&#8217;re being able to come up with different and innovative new looks on something that could have been easily solved with one, two, three. A lot of times that strategy involves using some sort of new technology, whether it&#8217;s a software or whether it&#8217;s an actual physical item. We use these things on a day to day basis, like artificial intelligence for example. We use it when we unlock our iPhones during the day or when we&#8217;re logging into our computers, but it&#8217;s never seen to solve a problem but more so just be a whistle and bell.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
I guess just trying to incorporate that into day to day life is going to start to make it easier for, I guess for all users. An experienced design is something that some people might see as when they think of experience design, they think of user experience which in a lot of cases is UX and UI so to speak in industry term, that&#8217;s doing a lot of wire framing and looking at apps and the development or more so the design of the development. So you&#8217;re doing a lot of sketching, you&#8217;re doing a lot of prototyping and things of that nature. But in this sense, experience design is being able to create an experience for ideation for co-creation to happen. Because that&#8217;s ultimately what&#8217;s going to help take our clients to the next level is being able to co-create one room and come up with a solid solution that has to deal with pushing the limits as well as sticking to what the company&#8217;s core values are.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Now before Accenture you were doing art direction and doing brand design for a very popular local restaurant here in Atlanta. Talk to me a little bit about that.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Yeah, so before I came to Accenture I was working with Slutty Vegan. A lot of people know them as like the hot vegan burger joint and it&#8217;s definitely quite the experience having worked with such an amazing team like that. Back in I guess November of 2018 their team had a social media challenge which was package designing. Of course people knowing that I&#8217;m a foodie and I had been telling people, &#8220;Hey you guys should eat at Slutty Vegan. The line is super long but you guys should eat there,&#8221; to people sending me these different or the post from the package design challenge. So I ultimately ended up entering and I was like, &#8220;Okay, There&#8217;s some other designs out there and it should be interesting to see if I even make it to the next round.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
But then a few days later I get a notification that, &#8220;Hey, you made it to the top 10,&#8221; so of course people are voting on line. And I&#8217;m every day searching through the comments and even Jermaine Dupri voted on mine, which was kind of crazy and ultimately ended up winning the design challenge in which they paid me for the design. But then they also made me their personal freelancer. So all of their design needs were I guess driven towards me. And then with that, them having posted me on their social media, I also got all of these different freelance clients and I mean I was working on like 10 clients a month at one point and it was just crazy. So then once I was like, &#8220;Okay, freelancing was nice and everything,&#8221; but I think I was ready to make that full time commitment with Slutty Vegan as they were with me.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
So probably around May of 2019 they hired me on full time and so I was able to create so many different types of designs for them. Everything from the bags in their restaurants to the fry cups. They just came out with the new Slut Sauce in stores near you soon and a few different other items that have reached a lot of people ultimately. And something that was also interesting, Pinky originally told me, she said, &#8220;I want you to put your name on the design.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
I was like, &#8220;Wait, you want me to put my actual name on the back?&#8221; Like, &#8220;Yes. Put it on there.&#8221; So I ended up putting it on there. She uses these bags every day now. So I have different people following me and out to me every day just because of something that I did almost or I guess almost like a year and a half ago now. It&#8217;s definitely been a great experience and I still work with them to this day, just on a freelance base. But definitely something that I recommend for any designer that wants to push their limits. Working with local businesses is a great idea.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:<br>
Wow, that&#8217;s a pretty awesome story.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Thank you.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:<br>
I mean you want a design contest, ended up working with them and they even, of course, I mean trust your work enough to want to work with you, but then to also say put your name on design. Like you never hear companies try to put that much investment into their design in that way or to their designers. That&#8217;s really good.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Exactly. And you know, the really cool thing about Pinky was that anybody that she hired on, she had known already that they were I guess contractors so to speak, so they still had their own businesses but Slutty Vegan was one of their clients. So she always put it as, &#8220;This is going to be that company that helps you step forward into whatever you&#8217;re looking to do.&#8221; So I definitely thank her for supporting my designs and being able to &#8230; I mean like I said I branded so many different things that, some that I can&#8217;t mention because they haven&#8217;t rolled out yet, but others that reached so many people, it was definitely a really good opportunity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nice. I have yet to make it to Slutty Vegan. I keep hearing about the lines and that puts me off because I don&#8217;t want to go and have to wait an hour in line. I don&#8217;t even know if there&#8217;s a good time to go. I&#8217;m assuming it&#8217;s still super popular where people are waiting in those long lines. Right?</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Yeah. I mean literally you&#8217;re with everybody else in Atlanta. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;I would love to go to Slutty Vegan, but the lines are always terrible.&#8221; Okay. So here&#8217;s a cheat. So I would say go on a Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon are usually the best time. So that 4:00 to 7:00 period because there&#8217;s usually no line there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Good to know. Good to know. I&#8217;m going to have to edit that out but no. So at the top of the show you mentioned being from Baltimore. Tell me about growing up there.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Yeah, so I am born and raised Baltimore. Family is from there. Went to an all girls high school, the oldest all girls public high school in the nation, Western High, as did all of the women in my family. So it was a traditional thing. So my high school was originally where I started doing design and I had taken a few AP art courses, which were pretty much just graphic arts instead of visual arts. So there I started playing in Photoshop and seeing what the different effects would do and I was able to get a few portfolio pieces out of that to insert when I went to Bowie State. So from high school, Baltimore was a really interesting place to grow up because when you&#8217;re younger you never really reach out. As an adult you might go to D.C. from Baltimore just because it&#8217;s an hour away but you&#8217;re never in D.C. unless it&#8217;s a field trip or something like that. So it was pretty interesting being so close to another really popular city but never really interacting with them I guess.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
And so I went to university, I went to undergrad at Bowie State University, an HBCU out in Laurel, Maryland. And so there, I actually met one of my design mentors and one of your previous interviewees, Jennifer White Johnson. She was my professor at Bowie. So she was really influential in my life and still is. She is an amazing visual artist. She is definitely a master of all tricks. I mean every time I see something different on her Instagram, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh my goodness, you&#8217;re doing this now.&#8221; She&#8217;s amazing. And she definitely helped me get through those college years of designing and just being able to articulate yourself as a designer of color and getting out what you&#8217;re really wanting to express. So that was pretty interesting. And she also definitely pushed me to go to SCAD during my, I guess senior year towards the end of Bowie. So she encouraged that move and when I moved down to Atlanta, I definitely kept in touch with her as well. Just sending her stuff and keeping up on what she was doing definitely inspired me to keep going as a creative. So yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
So talk to me a little bit about just what it was like in that sort of Bowie State learning environment. You&#8217;re right, we did have Jennifer, she was on the show I think two or three months ago, a few months ago. But I&#8217;m curious because I&#8217;ve heard a lot about Bowie State and I&#8217;ve certainly heard a lot about the program through Jennifer, through other teachers that are there. From your perspective as a student, what was it like?</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Yeah, so originally I honestly did not want to go to Bowie. I didn&#8217;t want to be in the state of Maryland. But you know when you have tuition and stuff it kind of limits you. So I ended up going to Bowie. A friend of my dad&#8217;s, which was another one of my professors, he showed us during my last year of high school, showed us around that building, which is the VCBMA, Visual Communications and Digital Media Arts building. So they had everything from theater to design and they had all these nice computer labs and it just set the tone for me to say, &#8220;Okay, if I really wanted to be in an environment where I&#8217;m able to flourish and also work amongst other designers that are my age and also that look like me then this would be where I would want to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
So especially at an HBCU, I knew that that was something that I wanted to do straight out of high school was that I wanted to be around my people. So I went to Bowie and my years there were pretty awesome just with my &#8230; I guess there I was Campus Activities [inaudible 00:18:14] Vice President there and I was on a lot of the initiatives under VCBMA, so different art clubs and things like that. And also, I would work to get sent to different conferences. So throughout my time at Bowie, I think they helped me go to two different conferences. One was HBCU South by Southwest, which is [inaudible 00:18:37] by a startup called Opportunity Hub that&#8217;s local here to Atlanta actually. Also a computer graphics conference called SIGGRAPH, which is over in LA. And they have it in a few different other places.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
So it opened the door for me to say, &#8220;Whatever you want to do, you have that ability to do it, so why wait?&#8221; Something that I was passionate about, this was something that had allies in I guess. Because sometimes when you don&#8217;t have friends that do the same things that you do or they don&#8217;t really understand your thought process and lot of things, then you get a little discouraged or unmotivated in some ways. So good to have a support system around me that cared about my growth and I also cared about theirs. And I&#8217;ll say that also about the professors. Many of them were supportive and one of them helped me get my first internship with another one of your interviewees, Leon Lawrence. I actually worked with him. That was my first design internship during my senior year. I commuted back and forth for a whole semester from Bowie to D.C. every two days or so. And I went to go work at NACo, the National Association of Counties, over in D.C. near the Hill. So that also was another step-</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
[inaudible 00:20:00] that also was another step in my education, I guess, that kind of opened my eyes to say, &#8220;Okay, there&#8217;s not just design for aesthetic or design for whatever. There&#8217;s designed for political things too.&#8221; That was something that I hadn&#8217;t even thought about. It was really interesting the way that he kind of ran his team as well. It got me exposed to a lot of different types of methodologies and just ways of doing certain things. Also, I ended up learning some different softwares there as well. But overall, being in college at Bowie you have the HBCU life mixed with the design life mixed with just being a part of the campus, so to speak.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Again, I was Campus Activities Vice President, so we kind of helped throw homecoming and spring fling and all those different events. I guess on top of that, I also helped design for those things too. I was designing all of the homecoming posters and all of the posters for different activities going on at school and any events and stuff like that. So that also kind of gave me the experience that I needed when I started venturing out to do more freelance work. So it was like, &#8220;Okay, I have something to build off of now.&#8221; It was definitely a really huge experience from me there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Wow. Shout out to Bowie state and there. One, I&#8217;ve heard a lot about how great the program is, but hearing you talk about it from the student end to see just how encompassing it was, not just to you as a designer, but also to you as a black person because you&#8217;re also working in these design environments with other black people. So you&#8217;re able to see kind of, &#8220;Oh, this is what the possibility can be for someone who looks like me.&#8221; You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Wow. When you first got down here to Atlanta, what was your first design job? I feel like there&#8217;s a story there.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
I signed up with a recruiting agency, which was the Creative Group and usually they have different clients and they&#8217;ll place you at these different places if fit the criteria or whatever have you. So I ended up interviewing with them. They didn&#8217;t have anything at the time, but I was interested in just being able to help, I guess other creatives get different design jobs and just being able to help also other creatives of color get design jobs because I felt like that was something that I had had a little bit of experience in on the design in, as well as on the the mentoring end, so to speak. So I ended up getting that job, which was just being a recruiter for different companies and things like that. So if, let&#8217;s say if Home Depot needed a website designer, we would help find them and place them there. That was really my first introduction to the business of design, so to speak.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
I got to learn a lot about what design agencies function like on the internal scale. So being able to know what a creative director was, what an art director was, what they did, what kind of projects they worked on, and more so for me, help me progress, what are they looking for in resumes? What&#8217;s the price point for those? How do I get the most out of what I&#8217;m doing now? So that kind of helped me or so to speak, pushed me to be able to start to venture out to these different companies and say, &#8220;Hey, I want to start applying for certain places so that I feel like I have kind of a wealth of knowledge to be able to compare.&#8221; I wanted to start to apply for jobs at that point.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
I think my first job here as a designer was more so freelance. So I was doing a lot of freelance for clients around the area because Atlanta is a really big place for entrepreneurs and everybody owns their own business here. Everybody has a store. They have social media presence, so everyone needs a logo done or some branding or some packaging for a new product they&#8217;re coming out with. A lot of my time was dedicated to helping other people kind of progress the branding of their business and sitting down with them and kind of looking over exactly what they needed to help, I guess progress with whatever visual assets they were trying to produce. Whether that be an apparel line or a candle line or a music label, whatever have you.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Then my, I guess Slutty Vegan was technically black my in-between job because it was still a startup environment, but I didn&#8217;t really have a design team there to support me and kind of balance with me. So I guess Accenture was my first real design job, so to speak, where I have some say in the creative decisions where I&#8217;m able to kind of produce what I want and have voice, so I can help support these different workshops and helping to gain the clients and things like that. Yeah, [inaudible 00:25:28] was definitely, I guess my first real industry job, so to speak.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s really good that when you started out here, it was in a capacity where you could really kind of see what companies were looking for in terms of hiring because&#8230; So I&#8217;ve been here now in Atlanta for 20 years now and I&#8217;ll tell people, like designers that want to come here or designers that are interested, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Atlanta is great for freelancers, but it&#8217;s terrible if you&#8217;re looking for work,&#8221; because like you said, there are so many people that are doing something. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve taken an Uber or Lyft somewhere and I happened to mention I&#8217;m a designer. All of a sudden, &#8220;Oh, let me get your card because I&#8217;m looking for somebody. I need a logo for this.&#8221; If I was still freelancing, I could be getting work left and right, but then I&#8217;ll have people that will contact me. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m moving from New York or San Francisco and I want to know what product design jobs are down here.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Also, the Atlanta, and I feel like maybe this is starting to change, but I still feel like the Atlanta business landscape doesn&#8217;t really respect designers, at least not in the same way as say New York or Silicon Valley when as it relates to kind of the competitiveness and the types of jobs and the amount of jobs that are available. Atlanta still feels like it&#8217;s a little behind in that respect. I&#8217;m curious when you were doing the recruiting, what is it that companies are looking for outside of what&#8217;s on the resume?</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Yeah. Atlanta, like you kind of said, it&#8217;s definitely a pretty big, I guess business park so to speak. I say that in the way of there are a lot of companies starting to move here on Georgia grounds just to get a little bit of the tech scene here because outside of Silicon Valley, Atlanta is definitely starting to be a hub of innovation that&#8217;s growing. There&#8217;s so many different startups and other technologies here that companies are wanting to move here. So these companies are primarily looking for&#8230; A lot of them like&#8230; Okay, and I&#8217;ll say this too. There are certain companies that like people that are fresh out, people that are going to schools like General Assembly, which you could do UX and UI and graphic design, that some people that are coming out of Georgia State or local colleges like SCAD too. But then there are some companies that want people that are seasoned professionals, so they want the people that have maybe freelanced for Cartoon Network and ESPN and all these other places because they understand and they can kind of bring something to the table.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
So I&#8217;ll say a place like the Home Depot, they have a huge hub here in Atlanta, but they definitely like to hire on a lot of the new talent because that&#8217;s what kind of keeps their designs fresh and that&#8217;s what kind of keeps their, I guess everything moving for them is they&#8217;re getting those people that are fresh out and they know the industry, they know what trends are going on. So they like that. It definitely just depends on your tenure and where you want to go. But in addition, they&#8217;re looking for people with obviously, their own full websites that are interactive, that look really good. They&#8217;re looking for people whose resumes are super on point as far as layout and simplicity goes, a really big trend, and this is nothing new to you or anyone in the industry is minimalism.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
So everyone likes to see something clean because honestly, maybe half the time, when the people that are hiring these designers aren&#8217;t designers themselves. The person that hired me at Accenture isn&#8217;t a designer in any way, shape or form. So it&#8217;s pretty interesting. You would be surprised to know that a lot of these companies are having a design manager who may not have anything hands-on to do with the design that&#8217;s hiring this person; definitely just to keep the perspective fresh in terms of what you&#8217;re putting out their stuff. Those are just a few things, but if you go to any of these recruiting agencies, they&#8217;ll kind of tell you what the client is looking for in that particular instance just so you&#8217;re getting the best out of that situation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Interesting. I had the roughest time with design back when I was really looking before I started&#8230; Well, not really before I started my studio, even when I was winding my studio down, it was tough. I remember going to one, and I&#8217;ll name names because I don&#8217;t care, but I went to not the Creative Circus, I think it&#8217;s the Creative Circle or something. They all have, &#8220;creative,&#8221; in their name in some [crosstalk 00:30:21] or whatever. But this was like the Creative Circle and I remember going and I had my resume and I had shown that I had my own studio here called, &#8220;Lunch.&#8221; This was at the time, I think we had just passed the eight year mark and I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ve done my own studio work for eight years. But then before that, I worked at Web MD, AT&#038;T and whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I remember the recruiter looking at my resume and she&#8217;s like, &#8220;Uh-huh (affirmative),&#8221; and then she put like a big X over my freelance experience on my resume and said, &#8220;So it looks like you stopped working in 2008. What&#8217;s that about?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wait, what? Do you not see the 2008 to 2017 part here where I clearly have been working and I&#8217;ve won awards and here are the awards and everything?&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, none of that really matters. We&#8217;re looking for people to have actual employment experience because we have to be able to check references and make sure that you&#8217;ve actually done the work and not just sat at home and said that you&#8217;ve done the work.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Well damn, okay. That&#8217;s rough,&#8221; but the reason I&#8217;m asking that is because I know like we said, there&#8217;s a lot of people here that do freelance work I&#8217;m basing it off my experience, I can&#8217;t really talk to others, but it seems like that freelance experience often doesn&#8217;t count sometimes.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Yeah. Sometimes in some instances it doesn&#8217;t for when you&#8217;re trying to get into those Fortune 500 companies. They want to see what, &#8220;real work,&#8221; you&#8217;ve done so to speak, and I say that quote unquote because they can see the you did this and that for this football team or the NFL. They want to see these big, large names that kind of strike some sort of excitement within them because if you&#8217;re doing anything on a smaller scale, they call it mom and pop shop stuff. So it all depends on the job that they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
But I&#8217;ll say when I was working with the Creative Group, we looked for all levels of people, people that were still in school and there was some people who were like, okay, we really wanted them for a particular job, but they were still in school and they didn&#8217;t have any real work experience. But then there were some people with 15 years plus work experience that we were like, &#8220;Okay, this person looks good because they&#8217;ve had this experience with A, B and C.&#8221; Definitely just depends on the scenario there, but I would say choose wisely and don&#8217;t put all your eggs in one basket because like you, I obviously didn&#8217;t have that well of luck with recruiting agencies because I ended up working for one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
That makes sense. I feel like the Atlanta ecosystem is very unique in that we have these top art schools like SCAD and Art Institute.q We have even really great programs at four year institutions like Georgia State, Georgia Tech, Emory, et cetera, but then we&#8217;ve also got all these HBCUs here. So you have this really interesting mix of talent from a lot of different points of view, a lot of different backgrounds, all different types of experience. It just seems like the Atlanta market has not necessarily found the best way to really tap into that. I still get conversations from people like, &#8220;Oh, we can&#8217;t find diverse candidates for our hiring pool.&#8221; In Atlanta? You mean to tell me in Atlanta, you can&#8217;t find a black designer? I refuse to believe that, but whatever.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
I was going to say something that, going back to Accenture, that I really admire about them is they not only promote diversity and inclusion, but they are one of those companies that shows it. I always kind of joke with one of my other senior managers and she&#8217;s like, &#8220;This is as many black people as you&#8217;re going to see in one environment at one time, so definitely soak this up.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, wow. It&#8217;s a huge mixing pot when it comes to so many different backgrounds and where people are from. I&#8217;ve met people from all different places all over because it [inaudible 00:34:37] all these different offices. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m happy to be a part of and I&#8217;m glad that they&#8217;re actually promoting that when they&#8217;re recruiting from these different universities and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
At your current stage right now, you first of all, congratulations. You recently graduated from SCAD, so congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Between that and the work that you&#8217;re doing at Accenture, how do you see the current design scene or the current design community in Atlanta?</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
I would say that the creative community here in Atlanta is diverse, not only in capabilities. There&#8217;s so many different types of design and creative, so to speak here; everything from set design to creative direction to brand design, but also, actually in I guess, physical appearance there are different types. I knew that going to SCAD it wasn&#8217;t going to be an HBCU or a PWI necessarily, but I was interested to see what that experience would be like. Surprisingly when I got there, we were probably still the minority, but there were a lot of different kinds of people there. There were Nigerians, there were Asian people, there were people from Columbia and Brazil and it was just a huge opportunity to be able to gain those different perspectives and just about what other people are thinking about and what other people are doing in their design. I still have really good design friends that are from all different backgrounds that kind of offer their own I guess, pizzazz, so to speak, to design. They definitely are able to articulate themselves in a whole different way than maybe you or me do.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
It&#8217;s really interesting to see that scene of people coming into the corporate world and of course, you want to keep up with different classmates and things like that. So they&#8217;re working at different agencies that deal with different ad agencies or they&#8217;re working on freelance or they&#8217;re working in the corporate space. It&#8217;s definitely becoming more of a&#8230; I guess corporate is starting to catch up to where the younger designers are just in terms of different trends that you kind of see going on in design right now and just through what their product is or what they&#8217;re advertising, what their ad looks like when it&#8217;s put out. So that combination of designers and environment is really starting to I guess, make Atlanta so to speak. Whenever anyone asks me, &#8220;How&#8217;s Atlanta,&#8221; or, &#8220;What are you doing down there?&#8221; Or, &#8220;How&#8217;s the creative scene?&#8221; It&#8217;s always something different going on. There&#8217;s always sort of installation going on or pop up or vendor market or even conferences. There are so many different meetups here.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Having worked for the Creative Group, one of my recruiting tools, so to speak, was meetup.com. So we would find events that had to deal with design and we would go to them to find people that we wanted to kind of recruit for the Creative Group. We would go to different events just that were being held based in UX design or based in development or there were all different kinds of designs. There were study groups, there were just having fun kind of game night design types of things. It&#8217;s definitely a really interesting combination of people versus environment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nice. So one of the projects we&#8217;re working on right now is called, &#8220;The 100 Days of Design.&#8221; Where did the idea come from for that?</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
I had just been kind of looking to doing a different medium of design. I had been doing your black and white graphic design, so to speak, which was using Photoshop and different Adobe tools to help with the designs. But I wanted to start illustrative style just because it was something that I had seen but I had never tried. Honestly, I was a little afraid or intimidated because I had seen so many different renditions and interpretations of different artists doing their own illustration.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
So I started doing, &#8220;100 Days of Design,&#8221; and I looked for a challenge actually, to do, but I couldn&#8217;t find anything. I think there was one, but it started in April and I was like, &#8220;Well, I want to get started now.&#8221; So I made up my own challenge and it&#8217;s probably some other designers have probably done it, but I just called it, &#8220;100 Days of Design.&#8221; So each day, I am pushing myself to not only create one thing each day, but also share it because something that I had seen in the past just with my own work, was that, especially a lot on my social media with Instagram and Facebook and things like that, was that I hadn&#8217;t put too much of my work on there. I wanted to get into the habit of being able to share my work with others, not because I wanted them&#8230; Well, I guess not because I want to promote myself, but just because I wanted to get my art&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Not because I wanted promote myself, but just because I wanted to get my art out there into the world and you know, not just have it on my website or because I was actually talking to a friend and he was like, &#8220;You should start to put your stuff somewhere else other than your website.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, why? Like why does it matter?&#8221; He&#8217;s like, &#8220;It&#8217;s a way of expression.&#8221; Because he&#8217;s a photographer. So, if you&#8217;d look at his Instagram, it&#8217;s all his work as opposed to just pictures of him and random stuff. So, it&#8217;s just a way for me to be able to push myself to create every day, to keep going, to be able to route to different opportunities with my design and see where I can push the limits personally. So.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nice. How&#8217;s it been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
It&#8217;s good. I am not the best when it comes to time management. So, I&#8217;m still definitely trying to figure out a good schedule because with me working full-time plus I do yoga after work and still kind of studying it and I got my certification in yoga last February. So, still kind of studying it whenever I have the time to and doing design and it&#8217;s like I wanted to be able to, I guess, find some time for myself to do something that I like to do while not sweating all day and working hard diligently all day.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
So, besides that part of it, I think it&#8217;s going pretty well and I&#8217;m starting to explore the different types of illustrations I can do and different ways that I can start to incorporate different things like color palettes and themes and things like that. So, it&#8217;s gone pretty well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Well the good thing is you don&#8217;t necessarily have to do it every day. So, like a hundred days, there&#8217;s 360, well, this year there&#8217;s 366 days. So, you can get a hundred days out of that, doesn&#8217;t have to necessarily be consecutive.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Right. I&#8217;ve been like some days I&#8217;ll group them together. Like this past weekend I just grouped Friday through Sunday together. I was like yeah, here&#8217;s all of the weekend stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I mean that&#8217;s kind of what you have to do, especially when you&#8217;re working full-time and you&#8217;ve got other stuff going on. I did a project back in 2015 called the Year of Tea. It was a podcast and I would do a different episode, like a short episode, like less than five minutes reviewing a different type of tea or a different brand of tea or whatever. And I didn&#8217;t do those every day. I would batch them, especially if I knew I was going to be off at a conference for a week or off somewhere else, I would just batch them so they would schedule to go out. Now I kind of shot myself in the foot a little bit because I said like a year. So, I had to do it every day. A friend of mine, Diane Holton, who has been on the show, she&#8217;s a deputy art director at AARP in D.C. And she did a whole thing also on Instagram, a whole like daily-ish design practice called Daily Digits where she fashioned numbers out of different found objects. So, like she would get-</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
I think I saw that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
&#8230; like little candies and make the number eight or something like that, you know? Oh, you heard of it?</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
I think I saw it because I had followed Diane at one point. With the whole D.C. And Bowie thing, they always brought someone new from the creative D.C. space to Bowie, so I think I had met her.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah, she did the campaign, well that wasn&#8217;t a campaign. I know she did end up doing a campaign with HP on the whole like thousand, she did a thousand of them for Daily Digits. So, it was just interesting seeing how she would take these random objects and just make numbers. Like I&#8217;m looking at it right now. One of them, she took Kit-Kat wrappers and made 997 and then she used ramen noodles and flavor packets to make 998. Used gummy worms to make 999 so it&#8217;s interesting how you see all these different objects and figure like, oh, what&#8217;s a way to create something out of this? You know, that&#8217;s a really good thing. I wish more creatives did that just as a practice, not necessarily to have like a body of something to show off, but it does kind of, it engages that sense of discovery and creativity that sometimes can get lost if you&#8217;re just doing a nine to five or if you&#8217;re hustling as an entrepreneur, you kind of lose that spark a little bit unless something new comes along and then this forces you into that on a pretty regular basis, I think.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Yeah, absolutely. And, and I&#8217;ll say, going from the startup life with Slutty Vegan and it was kind of like a 24/7 thing because it was weekends, it was during the week, it was all the time. So, ultimately I was doing stuff for them, but I never was able to kind of get out my own creativity and be able to push myself to say, &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s think of something new. Let&#8217;s create something new.&#8221; When I came over to Accenture, it was like, I&#8217;m still in this transition period and I had some other things in life going on, so I wanted this time to be able to start fresh this year. You know, not having made any resolutions, but more so just intentions of being able to help myself grow and help that self-discovery, like you were saying. That kind of made that internal spark from me because it was something that, when you haven&#8217;t done it for a while, it&#8217;s like you almost a little bit lose that motivation.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
And that&#8217;s something that is what makes you, you, it&#8217;s something that encourages you do better. It encourages you to keep going and it encourages you to be this free being. So, it was something that I wanted to be able to still have and say, &#8220;Okay, this is something that I&#8217;m going to do for me.&#8221; I&#8217;m just more so sharing it just to get into the habit of sharing it. But this is definitely something that is all for me and not to, like you said, have a huge body of work, but just to have, to see my progression over my works and to see which ways I can do different things here and there. So.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. So, just to kind of switch gears here a little bit, what are you excited about at the moment?</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Currently &#8230; Okay. Can I name two things?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Sure.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
One is a quick thing, so I&#8217;m excited about South by Southwest this year. I want to go, and obviously Accenture being a huge company in innovation they&#8217;re always doing different events there. So, not only for them, but I went back in 2017 and it was, even without having a conference ticket, I mean we had one, but outside of the conference is where the installations were and the companies were doing these huge pop=ups and all different kinds of stuff. So, I would love to go back to South by Southwest this year. So, that&#8217;s my number one thing.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Number two. So, at my job right now at Accenture, we are trying to push our internal teams to start doing more things that are combining technology with design and more so, so that it makes sense to them combining technology with strategy, so to speak. Because when you&#8217;re talking to them, it&#8217;s more so just about the tactics behind things and how you&#8217;re going to do what you&#8217;re going to do to get there. But the what and the how that you&#8217;re going to get there in. We&#8217;re trying to make that aspect of it technology.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
So, for example, we have an internal application that allows you to use this artificial intelligence and this augmented reality to be able to present these huge PowerPoint presentations just at the touch of your fingers, but certain things like that. Obviously, it sounds like a really extravagant idea, but things like that take time along with testing and just being able to figure out the kinks, figure out where it works, push its limitations, see how it engages with its audience and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
So, certain things like that within our hub we are kind of testing just to see what, I guess, how we can advantage it the most. So, that&#8217;s definitely something that I&#8217;m excited about as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
What&#8217;s something that perhaps not many people understand about you?</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Oh, I would say a lot of people don&#8217;t understand my perspective. Having come from Baltimore within the inner city goes to school there and coming from there to Bowie to Atlanta and going to different places along the way. A lot of people don&#8217;t understand my thought process when it comes to how I&#8217;m thinking about things. And I guess the fluidity in which I&#8217;m thinking about certain things, I always like to get variety and get other people&#8217;s perspective and get just a round table view of what&#8217;s going on. Because I feel like before we do any problem solving or solution oriented tactics, we need to figure out what&#8217;s currently at the table and get it from each angle. So, I&#8217;m always the one to say, &#8220;Well, have we thought about this? Well, how did we get here if we haven&#8217;t gotten there?&#8221; Or I&#8217;m always the one to ask questions.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
And to some people it may come off as, well, maybe I don&#8217;t want to use the word arrogant, but sometimes it may come off as like a know-it-all type of situation, but more so it&#8217;s just pushing people to be able to understand the different sides of one situation. Because outside of your view, there are the person that you&#8217;re talking to and the people that they&#8217;re talking to. So, always pushing people to see the different perspectives in life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Who are some of the people that influence you?</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Some of the people that influence me, I would say a lot of them are within the educational sector. Two of them which I went to Bowie with or which were my professors at Bowie, one is actually Jennifer White-Johnson. She definitely had a huge impact on my college life when it came to design and things like that. But also another one of my mentors at Bowie, Tamisha Ponder, she is my yoga mentor, so to speak. So, I have my design, I have my yoga. They definitely helped shape the person I became at Bowie from the different programs that I had joined with both of them in it, or the different events that I attended that they may have hosted or certain things like that had an influence on what I thought or what I made of the different topics that were brought up.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
And just being able to get exposed to certain things like that, as opposed to just doing the college thing, going to class, going back to my room, being really interactive with things that were going on, not only on campus but outside of campus, what can you do? They would always push me to do things off campus because one of them did go to Bowie and the other, I think, Jennifer White-Johnson went to UMBC. So they were like, do things outside of here. Don&#8217;t just say here, venture out. So, that&#8217;s definitely something that impacted me throughout my college years.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
And just now to this day, they both give me a really positive influence on life. And I would say one other person is a professor that I had at SCAD, Judy Salzinger. She is definitely a character. I love Judy so much. I remember one of the first things she said to me, she was like, &#8220;You know what Jailyn?&#8221; I say, &#8220;Yeah?&#8221; She said, &#8220;You&#8217;re a smart ass.&#8221; And I laughed. [inaudible 00:52:40].</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
I was like, okay, good. Yeah, Judy is amazing. She was also one of those people that helped me see the different views on things. She was a professor for a few of my classes at SCAD, but she&#8217;s also the chair of the department of advertising there. So, just through, she took us on different field trips and just from sitting and talking with her, she was an industry professional before, so she had some experience in the things that I wanted to do and the places that I wanted to go. So, her being kind of my on-site influence because she was here in Atlanta when I came down here. And then just having my two other mentors back home and keeping up with them still. So, it was kind of a nice, easy balance between the three of them and the impact that they kind of put on, not only my design life but life outside of design as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nice. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? Like it&#8217;s 2025 what kinds of things do you want to be working on?</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
So, in 2025 I would love to, over the years just start to learn how to design in these different softwares that are dealing with virtual reality and augmented reality. Hopefully wouldn&#8217;t take a full five years but definitely would be looking into starting to utilize that in people&#8217;s day-to-day lives. These are things that some people think are just the bells and whistles on the car, but in reality these are the moving parts to it. And these are things that we can start to incorporate into what we&#8217;re doing on a day-to-day basis. So, I would love to just be able to kind of articulate that with a company that is that forward thinking and that open-minded, so to speak, to give that leverage towards me to be able to help promote these different technologies and help put them in a way that is not only solving a problem but also is, obviously visually pleasing. So.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and about your work online?</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
So, you can go to my website, www.jailyneasley.com. J-A-I-L-Y-N E-A-S-L-E-Y. And you can find me on Instagram @finessewilliams, like finesse, F-I-N-E-S-S-E, finessewilliams_ _ on Instagram.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nice. I like that for Finesse Williams. That&#8217;s dope. Well, Jailyn Easley, thank you so much for coming on the show. I think as I mentioned to this to you, when I reached out before I was like we&#8217;ve actually had crossed paths before. This is back when we were trying to do our whole student perspective series. I think you were still at Bowie at the time and I think to look at that and now especially as you&#8217;ve talked about your story coming down here to Atlanta, going to SCAD, working with these brands. It&#8217;s amazing how much you&#8217;ve been able to accomplish in really a fairly short amount of time and I think it&#8217;s great that you&#8217;ve had the support of other black designers and other really honestly black people in entrepreneurship and business to make that happen. And I feel like that&#8217;s something that we just need to see more of and I&#8217;m really excited to see what you do in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Like as I was hearing you talk about this, you reminded me a lot of someone who we&#8217;ve actually had on the show three times now, Sarah Huny Young, who, she&#8217;s now &#8230; What does she want Sarah do now? She&#8217;s a DJ now, I think, but she&#8217;s been a pivotal part of design and stuff for like the past 15, 20 odd something years. There&#8217;s like three interviews over on the site so people can listen to it. But as I was listening to you describe all of these different experiences you&#8217;ve had and working with all these different brands, I was like, I can see just how grand your career is going to be. So, I&#8217;m glad to have the chance to talk to you at this stage of your career and see just how things are going. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Jailyn Easley</b>:<br>
Yeah, well thank you for having me.</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Hey, I&#8217;m Nick Caldwell, Chief Product Officer at Looker.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
So talk to me about your work at Looker. I&#8217;m curious, what is an average day like for you there?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Oh, complex question. I&#8217;m a Chief Product Officer, so that means I&#8217;m responsible for product engineering and design. I also have the security team, which I&#8217;m responsible for. My average day is honestly really hard to predict. But I can tell you what I aspire for it to be is that I&#8217;ve enabled all the people who work for me to get their best jobs done without my help.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
That is to say, if I&#8217;m doing my job correctly, all of my team members know exactly what they&#8217;re supposed to be doing to contribute to the overall strategy, and then I don&#8217;t have to jump in and bother them about it. They can do it themselves.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
But what that leaves for me is, in the instances when my team can&#8217;t do that execution without my help, I get to jump in, get people unblocked, help solve problems. And I guess, the position I&#8217;m in, only the really juiciest most difficult problems bubble up to me.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
And then beyond running the team in that way. The other cool thing you get to do as the Chief Product Officer is you get to be kind of a public representative for the company. So I spent a lot of time talking to customers. Just before recording this podcast, I was doing an interview with a news publication to talk about our upcoming release, Looker Seven. Just generally finding ways to represent the company publicly, not just by talking about the product but also by bringing my own personality to the mix. It is a really fun part of the job.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
So it sounds like, one, you help with the vision being the representative of the company, but then also ensuring that the people under you can manage and do strategy and actually contribute to the overall product.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Yeah, for sure. We&#8217;re scaling. Looker is a fast growing company. I guess I should mention, we just got acquired by Google, and that&#8217;s kind of a testament to how well the business is going. But as we scale, we have to think about how does our organization handle more people who work for us?How do we handle the much larger volumes of customers that we&#8217;re going to have? For me that means thinking about, obviously the product, what we&#8217;re building, but in some sense, I also have to treat the organization like a product as well. It has needs that grow and develop over time as well.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
So, trying to figure out where our next generation of leaders is going to be, trying to empower them with all the same sort of skills and techniques that I would want to apply myself. But I can&#8217;t be everywhere, so we&#8217;ve got to have that next generation of leaders come into play. And leadership development and that sort of class of problem is really fun. I enjoy coaching folks, mentoring them and then seeing them go up notches in their career. And I&#8217;ve been fortunate, for the past few jobs I&#8217;ve had, to be in positions where I am doing a lot of that scaling and growth and people development, and get to see the fruits of that bare out in successful products. And also just seeing people get further along in their careers.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s fun. I enjoy that part of my job quite a bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. As I was doing my research, I was looking up the acquisition, $2.6 billion.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Not bad. Not bad for a boy from PG County. Yeah, we&#8217;re doing pretty-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I know all that money didn&#8217;t go to you, of course. It went to the company, but I&#8217;m curious, how did that acquisition change your life?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
There&#8217;s a couple of different ways to answer it. I&#8217;ll give you the corporate answer. I think you want the real answer. The corporate answer is the corporate answer is we&#8217;re going to be &#8230; Sorry, the deal hasn&#8217;t actually closed down. I think it will probably close by the time this podcast airs, but what it means from the product perspective is we&#8217;re going to be able to accelerate all of the product functionality we want to build. We&#8217;ll have access to greater resources. Google plus Looker enables us to really fully deliver on the vision that we have for the overall product.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
But I think you&#8217;re talking about from a personal perspective. From a personal perspective, what&#8217;s happened is this opens a whole new class of problems/opportunities for me, largely around the fact that, yeah, to be blunt, we&#8217;ve got a lot more money. It was just the most first world problem to have because it&#8217;s making me think about responsibilities that I have, back to the community or to my family. It puts me in a position to have a much greater impact than I thought I could ever have, even just a year ago.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Earlier, I was talking about my desire and strong passion on leadership development. Well, now I&#8217;m in a position where maybe I can take some of my good fortune and reapply that to nonprofit efforts or more larger scale ways to develop leaders. I didn&#8217;t talk about this earlier, but one of the things I&#8217;m doing on the on the side now is my wife and I have started a nonprofit, which is focused on getting more people of color into technical executive leadership positions.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I guess even before that, I was spending increasing amounts of time with a nonprofit called /dev/color, which is around getting junior engineers of color into higher level positions within their company.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
So starting to think a lot less about securing the bag and a lot more about legacy and what it means to help develop the next generation of leaders. And I think anyone who&#8217;s been given privilege, at least in part, has to think about how they can use that privilege to help lever up other people. So I spend a lot of time thinking about that right now. I don&#8217;t know if I have the right answer to it, but I certainly have an opportunity to make an impact in a way that goes well beyond building products, and into making it easier for the next generation of engineering leaders of color, making it easy for them to succeed. So I want to try and do that.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Where we&#8217;re getting moving on it. I aspire to make a difference here and I just feel fortunate to be in a position to be able to have this as a problem.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
How did you get started on Looker?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
It&#8217;s not too complicated. I was VP of engineering at Reddit and I had been there for a couple of years, and I was starting to think about what my next opportunity would be. As you know, in the Bay area, your typical tenure at any company is around two years. Startups move really quick. So I&#8217;d started to look around.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Looker, the CEO, a guy named Frank Bien, he needed someone to help them scale the product and engineering organizations. And then additionally Looker has what&#8217;s called business intelligence product. And I&#8217;m in my previous roles at Microsoft, I actually built one of the world&#8217;s dominant BI products.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
So it was just very, very fortunate in terms of timing, it all came together. I was right in the mindset of exploring new opportunities, and Looker needed someone with almost my exact expertise to come in and help them scale up. So running product engineering design for a fast growing, modern approach to BI was just the right place at the right time.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I think three months after we joined, we started to think about potentially IPOing, and then eventually we got acquired. So I really chose the right horse to bet on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
What is the hardest part about what you do?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
The hardest part about my job is that there&#8217;s a large number of what you call stakeholders. There&#8217;s a lot of people who depend on my organization to be successful. So if you think about what product and engineering do, we are trying to build the best possible product for our customers at any given moment. But how do we know what the best possible product to build is?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Well, we have to get inputs from all sorts of different sources. Existing customers, future customers, those customers can be differentiated by size, region, all sorts of different dimensions.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
We have our customer support team who wants us to focus on existing the existing product and making sure that the known bugs are addressed rapidly. We&#8217;ve got input from our field sales teams, who we&#8217;re discovering new requirements and new functionality. And then, I shouldn&#8217;t leave out, it&#8217;s important to treat your engineering organization as a customer as well. So they want us to, of course invest in better developer productivity tools, paying down technical debt, innovation projects that they may have discovered.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
All of this is the challenge. And synthesizing all of this is the challenge. And it&#8217;s my role to build an organization that can take all of this input, translate it into the best possible product roadmap or set of investments that we need to make as an organization. And not just the roadmap, but we didn&#8217;t have to go and build the organization, hire the right people, make sure that we have the right managers and line everyone up. All the skills that we have at our disposal are lined up to best meet these very, very difficult product challenges.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
So in a nutshell, synthesizing all of that is the toughest part of my job because there&#8217;s so many inputs, they change all the time. And the thing that we do to meet this demand is we build an organization. That organization is constructed with people, and every person has different motivations, things that they want to accomplish with their careers, different things that excite them and things that they want to learn. All of that has to come together in the right way for us to build a successfully operating product organization. So it&#8217;s complicated.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I can imagine, first of all, I think just with the acquisition, that changes the game for every single person that works at Looker because now you are part of this much larger, much more well known company. Of course there&#8217;s more money, but then there&#8217;s also, I would imagine like a merging of cultures, that probably come into play. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Yeah. We haven&#8217;t merged yet. We&#8217;re still waiting to integrate, but it&#8217;s one of the things that we do talk about as a potential concern. But the nice thing about the Looker plus Google union is we see a lot of good cultural overlap.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Looker&#8217;s headquarters is in Santa Cruz, so we want to make sure we don&#8217;t want to lose that. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever been to Santa Cruz, but Santa Cruz is kind of a beach town. It&#8217;s a very laid back and chilled place. We don&#8217;t want to lose that kind of cultural element that makes Looker feel relaxed and so forth.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
At the same time, we&#8217;re pretty excited about, I don&#8217;t want to say Google propeller hatism, but they do give out propeller head hats to every new employee. But there&#8217;s a certain amount of excitement that we have around the Google technical culture and how we can integrate some of their more forward looking products, like BigQuery and so forth. How we can more directly work with those products and integrate them into Looker&#8217;s product roadmap?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
So we&#8217;re pretty excited about it. From a culture perspective, I think we have a really solid understanding of what makes Looker great and successful, and then we want to take the best of that and bring it with us to Google.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Very nice. So you mentioned being a boy from PG County. What was it like growing up there?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I don&#8217;t know if your audience knows where PG County is. PG County is in Maryland-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
It&#8217;s black people. They know.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Awesome. Yeah, PG County is like 95, 98% black County in the Southeast of DC. Growing up there, on the one hand it&#8217;s super comforting. You&#8217;re in the community. It feels very welcoming in that sense.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
But I think the downside of that is &#8230; What&#8217;s a way to put it? Opportunities are not equally distributed. Talent, I think, and potential is equally distributed. But opportunities are not equal distributed. So, if you grew up on the East coast or in Maryland, I think if you&#8217;re going to stay in that area, you&#8217;re largely going to be thinking about government jobs, things of that nature. I kind of very early on in life realized tech would be a great way to go, if you wanted to think about A, being a part of forward looking trends, and B, making money.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I very early on tried to think of ways that I could achieve these goals, and it became clear to me that, because opportunities are not equally distributed, that I would have to find a way to get out of PG County and go somewhere else, if I wanted to achieve my maximum potential. And I think I realized that pretty early on. I can&#8217;t remember the exact moment, but it&#8217;s something that is kind of born out to be true.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
When I wanted to get the best possible education to set myself up for future success, I realized that it wasn&#8217;t going to be University of Maryland or UNBC, it was going to be, I&#8217;m going to try to swing from the fences, and I really wanted to get into a school like MIT or Harvard. Early on, I decided that was going to be the goal.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
And then from there, it kind of followed. I just kept setting this kind of personal mission to go wherever the best opportunities were, and try and take the best advantage of them. And that&#8217;s played out for, I guess most of my life.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Sounds like tech was maybe like a big part of your growing up, like you were exposed to it at an early age. Is that correct?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Yeah. I think when I was a, I must have been a toddler. I was like three, four-ish. My dad brought home a Tandy 1000. These were one of the very earliest types of computer. And my dad was doing casework. He was a a lawyer and he went from doing that on paper by hand to Tandy 1000 personal computer. So I used to sit on his lap and he would let me kind of punch into the keyboard. I&#8217;m surprised I didn&#8217;t break anything.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
But yeah, he got me kind of early games to play on it. And over time, I just got fascinated with this thing. By the time I was aged 10, I was for sure hooked on video games. I was playing PC games. And he bought me a book called Learn C Plus Plus in 12 Easy Lessons. Which was a lie, you can&#8217;t learn C Plus Plus in 12 easy lessons.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
And I really just dug into that. I decided that, that was going to be the thing I spent my summer learning. And by the end of the summer, I&#8217;d taught myself C Plus Plus and I used that knowledge to start my own bulletin board system. I don&#8217;t know if you remember these things, but pre-internet, you could set up your own little bulletin board systems and start your own community.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
And I started coding extensions for that, like little video games and things like that. I was already hooked and I started to see, as a part of doing this bulletin board system that the world was so much bigger than PG County. People from across the country would like call into this bulletin board system, leave messages on it or upload files. And it gave me an opportunity to talk to people from different walks of life and different age groups, different jobs. It was kind of like I got early access to all of the potential that the internet could have. And the key realization to all this, to me was like, this is going to be a huge later on. I should learn as much as I can about how to code so I can be a part of it.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Unfortunately, I dropped all my other hobbies. So, I went from like your typical eighties kid, playing outside every day, riding your bike around the neighborhood. I went from doing all that to just coding and working on software plugins almost instantly.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
So, I just immediately fell in love with it. There&#8217;s just something cool about, you write software and you know, you hit run on it and the computer is doing something like in a program fashion that you told it to do that. It&#8217;s just always been fascinating.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
And the other thing which is really important, this sparked a desire to me. I really started to get hardcore academic at this point in my life. And so it wasn&#8217;t just fascination with computers, it led to better academics. It led to me going to another school in Maryland which had better a computer science program, which ultimately ended up leading me to go to MIT.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
So it had kind of a very foundational role in my life. Being so excited about computers at this early age set me up with a great foundation for future career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Wow. Did you have your family support you in all of this? Because I would imagine starting out with this, and I guess I might be projecting a little bit, because this sounds so similar to me growing up.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
we didn&#8217;t have a Tandy 1000, my older brother had he had a Vtech Laser 50 computer. It was sort of like the size of a standard 10 key keyboard now. It has a one line dot matrix screen on it, and you could basically program. And I learned basic. In the library, they only had one computer book and it was on basic. I need to find that book. But it was like a green book that taught you how to program in basic. And the Laser 50 came with all these little peripherals like a cassette, like a disc drive, but it&#8217;s a cassette, you know?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
It had a little tiny dot matrix printer that you could expand memory and do all this sort of stuff with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
And I remember just learning how to code on basic with that thing, and then graduating from that to like the Apple 2E in school. We were learning how to do that and work with doss and all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
My mom probably hated it. She wanted me to be doing other stuff, like getting out there and, &#8220;Oh, you should be going outside&#8221;, like you say, riding bikes and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
And I was like, &#8220;No, I want to program. I want to go to the computer lab&#8221;. How was your family? Would they support you in all this?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
It was odd. My family is great in the sense that they tried to expose me to a lot of different things. My dad, jazz music, chess club, painting. They would encourage me to do all sorts of things. And programming was one where it was so clear and that it stuck with me, that I really wanted to stay with it, because I dropped all these other hobbies.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
So they actually leaned into it with me. I think what I remember is once I expressed that I was interested in it, not only did my dad continue to take me to the bookstore &#8230; The first book I got was learn C Plus Plus. I think the next book I got, which was stunning to me at the time, it was like a $250 book on how to code video games. So that was the second or third programming book I ever bought. So I was learning how to do assembly language within about four or five months of deciding that this was interesting. And my dad was putting a lot of money into it. I was like, &#8220;Wow, 250 bucks&#8221;. Oh, and also my mother like found out-</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I think part of this was&#8230; Oh and also my mother found summer programs for me to go to where you could&#8230;A part of it would be like coding camps and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
And to get to those things, they were not in PeeGee County. We had to drive like two counties over to participate in those things. I was fortunate that they A. recognized that I was excited about this and they were willing to tolerate my near total fixation on it. So I was really fortunate in that. But yeah, I did have a few times where my mom did show up and just kicked me out of the house and saying: Hey you need to go stop staring at the screen and go biking. That did happen one or two times, but largely speaking, they were super supportive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Let&#8217;s talk about MIT. You went there for undergrad. What was it like there?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
MIT is pretty brutal. I actually, to be honest, I don&#8217;t recommend most people go to it. People ask me about that a lot now because I think MIT has a great reputation as a school. You will learn a lot, you will learn how to work. It is an extremely difficult school though. And for me, it was kind of doubly difficult because it&#8217;s not a very diverse school. So I was coming from PeeGee County, Maryland, which again PeeGee, my hometown is like 95% Black. Boston is none of that. Cambridge is none of that. So it was honestly like a major whiplash for me. To go up there and kind of be isolated from the community and then simultaneously&#8230; Like No one goes to MIT&#8230; When you were in high school, in order to get into MIT, you have to be pretty smart. So I was like yeah, I was a pretty smart guy in high school. You know, you build up a little bit of ego and so forth that lasts maybe three hours into MIT. I&#8217;m not exaggerating.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I remember the first day at MIT, they pair you up with the other first year students, right? You&#8217;d go out to lunch with them and things like that. So the first few hours of my MIT experience was: I went to go hang out with my group and when I sit down at the lunch table and I&#8217;m waiting for people show up. A little kid shows up. He sits down and a few other people show up. And we were all are kind of wondering why the little kid was there. So we asked him, Oh Hey, is your brother here or are you waiting for somebody? He was like, Oh no, I&#8217;m a first year too. I&#8217;m like, Dude, how old are you? He&#8217;s like, Oh I am 12. [crosstalk 00:24:20] That&#8217;s when it kind of hits you that like no matter how smart you think you, you weren&#8217;t, here&#8217;s a 12 year old who is probably a genius. He ended up being&#8230; A Few years later, he was teaching one of the classes and it was wild. It really forces you into a different mindset, which is no longer can kind of coast through any challenges. The challenges are going to be really hard and it gets you into a kind of a mentality that whatever life throws at you, you&#8217;ll have to come up with a plan and work your way through it.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
So in that sense, MIT was formative for me. There&#8217;s really not been any challenge that I&#8217;ve faced professionally that has come close to what I dealt with as a black student, going to MIT, going from PeeGee County to Boston and then putting up with that very, very rigorous difficult curriculum. But at the same time it just set me up to be able to take on any sort of challenge. If you look at my career after that, I mean I take big swings at things and largely speaking of have been able to pick my way through and find success. So I&#8217;ll stop there.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
So how did the NASA internship come up?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Oh, that&#8217;s funny that you mentioned that. So, like I was saying earlier in Maryland, you know a large number of people out there end up working at government institutes. So when I was in high school, because I could code, I had and because I had good academic record, we had the opportunity to do kind of an intern program as part of our high school curriculum. So I think this was junior year, I was able to take time off of regular school and go work with a governmental institution. I&#8217;ve loved the space program since a young age. I mean I think anyone from our generation probably would tell you how fascinating to watch shuttle launches and stuff. It used to be a huge deal.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
So when the opportunity came around, it was like NASA or NSA or the FDA. I think those are the three ones that I could go to. And of course I jumped at NASA. I ended up working there as an intern for three years and working on satellite parts. Now the problem with working at a government institution like NASA is it takes a long time for that stuff to ship. Nowadays, if you&#8217;re in tech like people complain about like, Oh, don&#8217;t do waterfall. What they think waterfall is. It takes like three months to plan something that&#8217;s nothing at NASA. I mean I was there for three years working on this satellite, high energy solar spectral imager. I believe it didn&#8217;t actually launch until three years later and then it exploded when it launched. They had to redo it. So I think the from a total project length, I think it was more than eight to 10 years. So I really enjoyed being exposed to that early on because one, again, I got to learn more coding. When I was at NASA, I got to do a combination of Visual Basic, Assembly. I got to learn very how to code for very specialized pieces of hardware, which was really fun. But it also taught me that working in a government Institute was not what I wanted to do for my career. I like to be entrepreneurial. I have to be fast paced and thought to myself like maybe the answer to that, what I really want to do isn&#8217;t at this NASA job no matter how cool I thought it would be, I&#8217;ve got to keep looking. So that kind of planted the early seeds of I want to do something entrepreneurial. Like I didn&#8217;t get to sow those seeds for a very long time, but that&#8217;s kind of where it started.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Just hear you talk about this. I&#8217;m trying not to make these parallels myself. but like, so this is probably about, I don&#8217;t know, maybe 11th or 12th grade. I just wanted to like get out of my small, so I&#8217;m from Alabama, I&#8217;m from Selma, Alabama. And it&#8217;s funny you mentioned that about like spacing growing up because space camps in Alabama, it&#8217;s in Huntsville because we have a, Oh sorry. We have an nice facility and normal, which is near Huntsville where the space camp is and so never got to go to space camp. But space was always something that was kind of around, I felt like based on where I was going in terms of my education, like working for the government was going to kind of be the goal. So right around 11th or 12th grade I was really looking at like what are places that I would like want to intern and work at. NASA was one of them, CIA and FBI or what I was looking at like I want it to be a clandestine service agent.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I laugh at it now, but because I was good in math and it was sort of the thing that my, one of my teachers was trying to push me into, like you can really do this and you know, that sort of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
And so you mentioned The Challenger and I&#8217;m actually a Ronald McNair scholar, Ronald McNair, one of the astronauts on Challenger. And so that&#8217;s how I ended up going to Morehouse. I got a McNair scholarship and then that&#8217;s sort of fed into the NASA internship. The program that we worked on. The first year I interned, I was at aims, which is out in Moffett field, which is a near mountain view kind of South of San Francisco in the Bay. And I worked on these a Sofia projects, it&#8217;s a seven 47 that they cut a hole in on the side and they put in a huge like gyroscopic telescope.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Sofia stands for a stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy. So the plane like orbits the earth and like observes like magnetic fields and comets and all that sort of stuff. And so my internship was with Ames at the SOFIA Science Center. We were doing stuff like that. We were working with robotics. It was so cool. It was the coolest shit I have ever done in life. I kid you not. And I was also working with like HTML and stuff. Like I got the program, the robotics education homepage and we were teaching K through 12 students how to do programming with robotics using Lego Mindstorm kits. I&#8217;m like, this is the coolest shit ever done ever. And I go back to school and you know, studying and whatnot. And then my next internship was at Marshall Space flight Center in Huntsville and I was doing something a little different. I was working more with human&#8230; What was it called?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
A human computer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
No human factors engineering. Oh that was where I saw like my first 3D printer. That was where I saw&#8230; Cause like they 3D prints nose the cone on the space shuttle because it burns up on reentry. So they use this, this hexagonal like printing filament called Markcore. And like they print out, they showed me how they print out the nose cone and so I got to work with like human factors engineering and stuff like that. Still is some of the coolest shit I had ever done and I really want it to continue on that path. And then 911 happened and they pulled, the government pulled the funding for my scholarship program and I was like fuck. I don&#8217;t have anything else lined up? So I&#8217;m curious though, when you talked about like the entrepreneurial thing, once you graduated from MIT, like what was your next step?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I had a lot of students debt. So I want to start with this. Cause a lot of people ask me specifically like, Hey man, if you graduate from MIT, you should have gone to work for Google or Facebook. So I want to frame the timing of my graduation. Put it all in context. Google. I mean they were basically still a startup when I graduated. Facebook did not even exist or Mark Zuckerberg was still at Harvard and I had huge amounts of student debt. I really wanted to A. Be intact. The be finds the shortest possible path to like a successful, lucrative tech job. I want to pay back those loans, set myself up for success. Maybe go back to my hometown and be the big hero, help my mom pay some bills or something like that. Microsoft at that time was the biggest tech company and I decided I wanted to work there. They had a group called the natural interactive services division. It&#8217;s just a fancy way of saying they work on machine learning and natural language processing, which I had become like fascinated with during my time at MIT. I was doing machine learning on during an era when it was definitely not considered cool. I remember my advisor actually told me not to pursue machine learning is that it was a dead end. You know, it took a while.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
My advisor told me the same thing about the web. He said it was a fad. If you want to study this, you should change your major. So I did. Cause I started out computer science and changed the math.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Who is going to do this HTML stuff? I mean I ended up choosing Microsoft and it wasn&#8217;t an entrepreneurial decision. I think during my time at Microsoft I tried to bend the experience that way. I&#8217;ve joined teams that did lots of internal kind of new projects and new startups. I tried to find ways to express my passion for doing new things with new technology and taking on those big sorts of challenges within the broader ecosystem of Microsoft, which was obviously a very well established business. But if you, trace my career through there, started in a team that was doing like very, very forward looking [inaudible 00:33:58] and NLP tech and then they carry through to to multiple different other teams and was able to carve out like a very successful career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nice and you were there for a long time?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
15 years over 15 years. A little over 15 years.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I like the emphasis you put on that. Like a long wow time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
It is a long time. You started in what, like 2004, 2005 or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
My first internship there was 2001 I think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s a long time.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Yeah, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Well I mean I say that because you know, of course the industry has changed so much from year to year. I mean even if you think of those early times in the 2000s to now. It&#8217;s like night and day. And to be at the same place, especially a company like Microsoft that we know where Microsoft&#8217;s reputation was back then and then of course it, I don&#8217;t want to say it&#8217;s gotten maligned, but I would say like between like 06 and 2013 people were like: Yeah, we&#8217;ll look at Apple. Now Microsoft has started to sort of have this great resurge. It&#8217;s not just the gaming but like also with Windows 10 and with you know, devices and stuff like that. So to be at a company that long and to see it through all of that, that&#8217;s a rarity in this industry.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Let me shortcut, because I know we want to give people advice. I mean I definitely tell people not to stay at one place for 15 years nowadays. But in my defense I was just having a really good time. Externally Microsoft was dealing with all of these sort of challenges with governmental regulation and so forth, but for me in my role, like I was just popping between really, really fun projects. My first project was I got to own the spellchecker for all the Microsoft products. That thing shipped to more than a billion people. I mean like impact, right. You know, then I got to do a bunch of machine learning and NLP projects as a part of Microsoft exchange and SharePoint like one of the cool things about it was you could ship something and it could go out to you know, millions and millions and millions of people and you could really have big impact.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
And Microsoft also has something that early on to be blunted it had a very safe sort of understandable career path. Like you know, any big company that got like really well established job ladders and you can kind of like, particularly if you&#8217;re a video gamer that&#8217;s like, Oh, a ladder goals, achievements, I&#8217;m going to play that game and see how far up I can get it. So at Microsoft the game is like everyone wants to work their way up to a ladder level called partner. Right? So a partner is like considered you I guess you win the career game. So I, for a large part of my career I had this mentality that like your career was directly tied to your job title or the number of people who report it to you. And I had gotten into this mindset and you know in a big company like Microsoft, they actually do set it up so that you can if you value success in that way you can drive career in that way.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
And I was doing like doing that quite well. I ended up becoming a general manager at Microsoft, I think after 12 years. I hit that partner goal after around 12 years, which if for folks who work at Microsoft, like going from like new employee to partner or general manager and 12 years is extremely rapid pace. I think the only person I&#8217;m aware of who did it faster was a guy named Scott Guffey who&#8217;s currently the senior vice president of all of Azure. So I was having a really good time. It was long story short and I got to work on a product called power BI ended up being like the fastest growing Microsoft product in 2016 so I was having an amazing time, but I did kind of eventually realize that although I was having a great time working on new products inside a big company is not actually entrepreneurship.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I started to slowly realize this over time. Part of it was when I was getting toward the, I guess the last, the final few years of my career at Microsoft, I had decided to go get an MBA cause I love formal education. It&#8217;s just the way that I like to absorb content and learn. Formal education forces you to be in a place and a time to learn things. And sometimes I need that discipline if I want to learn. So I decided to get an MBA and I decided I wanted to learn about entrepreneurship. So I started to fly down to Berkeley Haas school of business on the weekends to take my MBA classes and I started to get exposed to people outside of the Microsoft bubble outside of the Seattle bubble. People who were could tell me about all of the cool things that were happening in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
And I was like, Oh wow. Like I used to not take this part of the world as seriously as I should have because I thought like, Hey, Microsoft is shaped can&#8217;t it company and you know, I can spend my whole career here and be happy. But as I started to get exposed to all these other people and companies and ideas, I realized just so much more opportunity out there if I&#8217;m willing to take on a little bit more risk and get a little bit more uncomfortable and maybe trap, pursue a career that isn&#8217;t just popping up job ladders and has maybe about taking a few horizontal moves or maybe have a smaller team with bigger impact because you know what I can deliver to the company matters more. So I started to think about my role in companies and how I want him to navigate my career radically differently.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
After that, that MBA, and then I think within six months of graduating the MBA, I had a meeting with my corporate vice president at Microsoft and was like, Hey, I think it&#8217;s, I think it&#8217;s time for me to go. I want to go, I want to go really be part of this startup ecosystem. And he&#8217;s like, where are you going to go? And I was like, well my, my friend works at Reddit and he says they&#8217;re looking for a VP of engineering guy like laughed in my face. It&#8217;s like, you&#8217;re going to go to Reddit. What&#8217;s that? So, but I really wanted to, I mean I think at that time Reddit was a series B startup. They really needed someone to help them scale the engineering team. And I was like, I&#8217;ve done this before. I&#8217;ve worked at, I&#8217;ve run big teams at Microsoft. I&#8217;d bet my skillset would be really, really valuable to this team. I bet I could have a huge impact, even though it&#8217;s a smaller team, that the impact that I could have would be much, much bigger in effect, all of the Reddit global audience, which is hundreds of millions of people. So I started to get really excited about that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
And I mean you&#8230;.You kind of joined Reddit in 2016 right? Like latest 2016.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
This was at a time when like the company maybe didn&#8217;t have the best reputation.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I mean you&#8217;ve said it very politely. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I mean to put it in context with people who are listening. This is near the time Trump got elected and there was a lot of stuff going on around Reddit in terms of just violent hate speech and things of that nature. Did you think about these things when you thought about going to Reddit or were you just kind of strictly looking at like, this is a startup, I want to do something more entrepreneurial. This is a good place to go for that?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
No, I did consider it because, going back to what I said earlier I early on in my tech career, if you will, I was running bulletin board systems. So I understand the challenges that come with building online communities. It&#8217;s just something, I was doing pre-internet. So when I looked at what the challenges are with Reddit, sorry, I kind of looked at that more like, I see the value here and the reason that they&#8217;re trying to hire me is because they also recognize these problems and they need someone to help. And the pieces that I can help with have to do more with engineering and so forth. But alongside me, they were hiring all new product people. They were gearing up to really take this sort of challenge seriously. I don&#8217;t know if you recall this, but the first week I had the job at Reddit, we actually went to a conference, excuse me, we went to the exec team, all went together to a conference called tech inclusion.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
It&#8217;s a conference that used to be run by Wayne Sutton.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Wayne Sutton, yes I know Wayne.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Yeah. No he is an awesome dude. But the very first week we were there, the whole exact team went and did an hour long, let&#8217;s talk about how Reddit is going to address problems on the site, including things like hate speech, including like wanting more diversity on the platform. So we were taking it really head on. So I knew all those problems were there, but in all of my interaction with the exact team, all I got was like the authentic desire to try and, make things better. It was like, well I can be a part of solving that. It was super fun. I mean that whole experience, I mean getting to scale their engineering team, getting to, I think you would agree that the reputation of the site is now a lot different in the sense that they have invested heavily and cleaning up a lot of the toxic communities and the infrastructure for doing that as alignment to scale more rapidly. You know, I feel really about the work that the team did there as well as the culture that we built inside the company. I mean we had one of the most diverse I probably the most, actually I&#8217;ll make a stronger claim. That was the most diverse company I&#8217;ve gotten to work at in my professional career. I was really proud of being a part of building that.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:<br>
When you look at your career now, you look back at it, currently at Looker, slash Google, Reddit, Microsoft, etc. What is Silicon Valley like for you at this stage in your career?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
At this stage in my career, Silicon Valley is just unlimited opportunity. I wished I had moved out here sooner. Silicon Valley, it is interesting the more&#8230; I&#8217;ve only been here three years if you just wall clock time.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:<br>
Okay.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
So I&#8217;m still learning about all of the different facets of how Silicon Valley works. And I&#8217;m by no means an expert. But one thing I have realized over the past, year or two, is that there is more opportunity and more money to fund ideas here than in any part of the world by far. It is an engine for connecting investment capital with bright, ambitious people. Now that&#8217;s all fine and good. The negative side of that, the thing that.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Now, that&#8217;s all fine and good. The negative side of that, the thing that as a person from P.G. County that I&#8217;m starting to realize is that, the opportunities are not equally distributed. So, although this is a place that is just phenomenal, there&#8217;s no better place in the world for investment, changing the future, yadda, yadda, yadaa, that opportunity is not available as equitably as it should be. And I&#8217;m trying to find ways to help with that problem. Part of it is, can we find ways to get more underrepresented people; people of color into tech positions. So, I do see a lot of progress on that dimension here in the Bay area. There&#8217;s so many bootcamps&#8217; and if you talk to startups in increasingly large companies, they&#8217;re seeking out new ways to bring diverse candidates into the top of their hiring funnels.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I see a lot of progress happening there. But, I still think that much of the wealth opportunity sits high in higher levels of career growth. Right? So, executive levels in particular. So, one thing that I&#8217;m spending a lot of time on now is trying to think through, how do we get people who are in middle or late career, people of color into executive roles. One thing I guess you didn&#8217;t ask me about Reddit was how do I even discover that opportunity? Access to executive recruiting networks, is something that I had discov- to discover effectively through word of mouth. I kind of got lucky. If I hadn&#8217;t had that luck, I don&#8217;t know if I would have ever been able to leave Microsoft, get introduced to the right people and start exploring different executive opportunities. So I&#8217;m going to try and make that easier for the next generation.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I think that having access to the right people, in the right network, is one of the largest inhibitors for people of color, to get to the next level of growth. And I want to try and invest in creating those networks. So next, I think I told you this, but next week I&#8217;m actually going to host an event where we connect. I invited a little more than a hundred people of color, mid and late career, who want to learn about how to get into tech exec roles. We&#8217;re going to have them and then we&#8217;re going to have a panel with more than six different executive recruiters and people of color who have made it into exec. roles and just talk about the paths and the right ways to network, the right ways to position yourself for those opportunities. How the interviews work differently than normal tech interviews.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I just want to spread that knowledge, as far and wide as I can into the community, to make it easier for the next, the next generation. Cause for me I had to discover all this stuff the hard way. I don&#8217;t think it needs to be that hard if we just share information.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. How do you define success now?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Early on I defined success as, trying to make money. You know, I&#8217;ve talked about that student loan thing. The middle of my career, I think I defined success is as, having freedom; the ability to work where I show wanted to on the projects that I wanted to with the people that I wanted to. And then, I think now, I&#8217;m switching into a mode where I define success as legacy. What am I leaving behind, and will I be remembered for having made an important difference, not just from a product perspective cause products come and go, but will I leave a positive impression on the next generation of, of people of color in tech? I think that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m landing, so I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll stop there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay. How do you sort of navigate the expectations that others might have about you? I would imagine, being at this stage in your career, and you&#8217;re doing all of this kind of outreach to the community, like you&#8217;re saying&#8230; How do you manage those expectations that folks have?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Yeah, I was going to say, what do you mean? Is this a trick question? Did you have some expectations?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
No&#8230; Do I have any expectations?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I&#8217;m curious what you know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I mean look, I&#8217;ve talked to a lot of people on this show, right? I never know how people are going to react. Some people I will ask and they&#8217;re like, I don&#8217;t want to talk about x, y, z. I don&#8217;t want to be classified, as a black blank, you know, whatever their title is or what have you. I was just curious because I know I&#8217;ve talked to people that are at, you know, sort of different levels of their career. Certainly ones that are at very high levels, and it seems like from the larger community, there&#8217;s a big expectation of, I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s benevolence of helping out or reaching out, reaching out or reaching back or what have you. Are those things that you even think about?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I don&#8217;t think the larger community puts this sort of expectation or pressure on me. It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s like intrinsic to me. I&#8217;ve been a manager for a long time. I think, I could claim I was pretty good one. And one thing that I think makes for good managers is you, you care about other people. That the best managers I&#8217;ve ever worked for, have tried to understand where I&#8217;m trying to go with my career and my life and they&#8217;re trying to line up the right opportunities, and the intersection of that is kind of the sweet spot. My personal goals and desires line up with what the business wants. We end up in the best possible place. So for me as a person who&#8217;s been doing that for a long time, as a lifelong manager, it&#8217;s just something that comes natural.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I really want to try and lift up others. So I look for opportunities to do that, and I get a lot of satisfaction out of it. But the community itself, it doesn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s not like people are kicking my door and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hey Nick, like because you&#8217;re in this position, you&#8217;ve got to give back&#8221;. That hasn&#8217;t happened. It&#8217;s really just more of a natural outcoming for the things that I want to do. And I, I feel like I&#8217;m very privileged in the sense that, I have access to knowledge, experiences and networks that I can make it more easily available to, to the next generation. So I guess that&#8217;s my answer. I don&#8217;t feel pressure for it. I get a lot of satisfaction out of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay. All right. If you could go back and talk to young Nick, like fresh out of MIT degree, what advice would you give him?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Young Nick, was not the Nick you&#8217;re talking to now. I have a lot of, takes a while to recover from MIT. So I guess the first, the first thing I would say is MIT related, which is, I graduated thinking technology, could solve all problems and technology is amazing, but it turns out people solve all problems and you can&#8217;t code your way to success. It&#8217;s a combination of code, working with people, and that is how you solve problems. So I would say, young Nick, spend more time understanding how the broader business you&#8217;re in works beyond development. Talk to PMs, talk to the testers, talk to sales, marketing, talk to all the people that it takes to bring an organization together, to build something. And it&#8217;s not just coding. I think chart your own course. I think, I learned this a couple of years in, but the best opportunities just don&#8217;t show up.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
The best opportunities come from, you being proactive and sometimes that means you just going out into the organization and saying, &#8220;Hey, is there any place I can help,&#8221; or &#8220;What are the big initiatives and where should I try and plug in?&#8221;. Sometimes it comes from, it does come from luck, but that luck, at least in my experience, is a result of having delivered good product and done good work and network. Right? So I would tell my young self,&#8221;Spend more time, trying to, create the environment where good opportunities will come to you; not just doing good work and expecting your manager to reward you for it. But networking and understanding the broader business context so that you could, so you can understand where your time should just be spent&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Actually, let me talk about one that&#8217;s probably the most important because you were making fun of me for working at Microsoft for 15 years. That&#8217;s probably the biggest thing I would say, which is, a lot of people talk about &#8220;Imposter Syndrome&#8221;. Imposter syndrome is like, &#8220;Hey, you know, I&#8217;m doing really good at, at my job, but I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m doing it. Like I lack of self confidence maybe I feel like I&#8217;m faking it&#8221;. So I hear a lot of people talk about imposter syndrome, but I think there&#8217;s like a bigger problem that affects people of color, underrepresented folks. And that&#8217;s what I call, &#8220;Just happy to be here syndrome&#8221; which is, for the longest time coming from P.G. County and going and having your first job be like a six figure paycheck. Right. That&#8217;s a pretty big freaking difference. That&#8217;s a big Delta. So for many, many years of my career I was like, well I&#8217;m just happy to be here because I&#8217;m making this amount of money and my alternative would be going back to P.G. county or something like that. I had that in my head. Just happened to be here.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
So, no matter what my bosses would ask me for if they wanted me to come over the weekend, something in the back of my head was saying, you, you&#8217;re just fortunate to be even in this situation. And I didn&#8217;t realize until far too late, that you don&#8217;t have to just be happy to be there. It&#8217;s the fact that you&#8217;ve made it into tech and that you&#8217;ve had any success, your knowledge, skills and abilities are what you have to offer and they have their own intrinsic value and that is what your managers and your company is rewarding you for. So they should be happy to have you. If you show in any sort of skill and results, increasingly, your company should be happy to have you.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I think that holds a lot of people back, who are under-represented. They maybe had a big transformation in their lives, going from, where, for me it was P.G. County to Seattle and making so much more money, making more money than anyone in my family had made. But, what that blinds you from is, particularly in tech, if you&#8217;re always just happy to be here, you&#8217;re going to be blinded to all of the new opportunities that are around you. And in tech, as far as I can tell, there&#8217;s no ceiling. There&#8217;s no job I&#8217;ve gotten in tech where I didn&#8217;t like pop my head up, look around for five minutes and there wasn&#8217;t even a bigger opportunity just right over the hill. Even today, I&#8217;m chief product officer at a multibillion dollar company that just got acquired and I can tell you, there&#8217;s much, much bigger things out there that I could even be doing it.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
There&#8217;s no end to it in tech. There&#8217;s so much opportunity. But, when I talk to people like myself, I suffered through this as well, who are new to their careers and they&#8217;re maybe not as confident of themselves or understand that they have this intrinsic value. They will pass up opportunities or, or let fear dictate like what their decisions are, and they will just be happy to have gotten the job at all. And I think the faster you can kind of get self confidence and get out of the mentality, the more you can control your own destiny, start making your own career decisions and really navigating all of the opportunities that are sitting here in tech, because they&#8217;re enormous. It&#8217;s much for the person who&#8217;s listening to this, and you just landed your first six figure job, the opportunities to go beyond that, are there. You can do much better. I, trust me, so don&#8217;t get locked into this, &#8220;Just happy to be here syndrome&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Wow, that&#8217;s powerful. I really, I really, really liked that message. What&#8217;s something that you&#8217;re really proud of that&#8217;s not on your resume?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
This is not explicitly on my resume and I, and the reason I can&#8217;t talk about it publicly is because we&#8217;re not supposed to share these sorts of impact numbers publicly, but when I was at Reddit, one of the things I was most proud of, I alluded to it earlier, was the impact that we had on our diversity in the engineering organization. We moved the number of women in engineering, the number of people of color in engineering there by double digit figures in a very, very short amount of time. So, for me being able to have that sort of tangible impact,, at a place that like has a reputation like I don&#8217;t know, you know Reddit has a reputation for not being the most diverse website, at least it did at the time I joined. But being able to come in and have that kind of sort of substantial impact, move the numbers in a real way, not just platitudes, and do it fairly quickly felt really, really good.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
It&#8217;s not something we&#8217;d get to talk about in public a lot because I think Reddit has a policy about sharing the specifics on the diversity numbers, but they&#8217;re quite good internally. I think the, on a related note, many of the people that worked for me at Reddit and many of the people who I mentor during that timeframe, have since gone on to get executive level jobs. I guess the thing I am very proud of at this stage of my life, is just seeing that my time and energy that I put into people, allows them to get to the next level and achieve whatever goals that they have in mind. That, I am broadly speaking proud when that occurs. I know it&#8217;s an odd way to be selfish, but I guess selfishly, I like to know that I helped other people. I guess that&#8217;s a way to put it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? It&#8217;s 2025, what are you working on?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I think, I&#8217;m going to be at Google for a while. We just got acquired, so I mean I, I&#8217;m excited about what we&#8217;re going to do with Looker plus Google. So I think for a product perspective that is pretty straight forward. But I think my ambitions are increasingly, expanding beyond product. I think, there&#8217;s kind of two other avenues that I&#8217;m exploring now. By the way, my wife also, is at Slacks and we both had startup exits last year. Silicon Valley standard for having a startup exit as you start to look at angel investing and you start to think about venture capital. So on one angle of what I&#8217;d like to see myself doing in five years is, I would like to have been first check to several startups founded by black starters that have, well black founders that have successfully exited. So over the last year, I think I wrote three checks to black founders last year. So, hopefully in five years we&#8217;ll see them being successful. Shout out to Morocco. I love you guys.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
The second thing that I&#8217;m thinking a lot about is how we can contribute to the next generation of people of color in leadership positions. So, I&#8217;ve been working on training programs and opportunities to try and give the next generation of exec talent, access to the same sort of things I was fortunate to have, that really set me a part of my career. So I was at Microsoft, I got access to proto executive training and it also had lots of training on it through my MBA program.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I&#8217;d like to see if there&#8217;s ways we can make those sorts of trainings accessible to the next generation of executive leaders, because to be blunt, not everyone should have to go through the level of difficulty that it took me to get those opportunities. I want to shorten the gap between the very, very large and existent, up and coming generation of potential leaders. I want to shorten the gap between them and available opportunities and I think that&#8217;s going to come through training and networking and just shining a light on the fact that there are all these folks who are just on deck, ready to take a swing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Yeah. If you want to follow me on Twitter, I think that&#8217;s the way most people find me nowadays. So follow me @Nickcald, Nickcald. If you&#8217;re interested in learning about engineering management or product philosophy, I&#8217;ve got a ton of stuff that I&#8217;ve been writing on medium so you can just Google that and otherwise I don&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t be shy. If you would like some advice. A lot of people just reach out to me on LinkedIn. I respond to almost everything, but I know a lot of people want to get coffee so I&#8217;ll tell you right now so I can&#8217;t have that much coffee. Like man, I would be wired nonstop, but I will always, always, if you, if you write me a thoughtful question, 99% of the time I take the time out of my day and try and give you an answer. So those are all the ways you can reach me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Awesome. Well Nick Caldwell, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I really had, no idea how this conversation would go. I knew that as I was doing my research, I was like, &#8220;Oh we have some things in common&#8221;. Like, I interned at NASA. I was looking at the time. I&#8217;m like, I felt like we were kind of right, doing things like right at the same timeframes and everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
But, hearing you talk about not just you interning at NASA, but the work that you&#8217;ve done with Microsoft, the work you&#8217;re currently doing at Looker, and really how you look at giving back to the community, in ways that I think will help set up the next generation of tech executives etc. I think is something which hopefully our audience can and learn from and get inspired by, to see ways that they can create a more equitable future. A theme that I&#8217;m running with for the year, how do we use our talents and basically the places where we&#8217;re at to kind of make a better future. And I feel like you&#8217;re doing it. Like you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re doing it, you&#8217;re making it happen.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
I&#8217;m trying man. I actually know that you mentioned this. I&#8217;ll just put one more thing out there cause you asked, &#8220;What advice could you ask me? What advice could I give to a younger version of me?&#8221;. I want to give advice to the older versions of me out there, because there&#8217;s a lot of folks who I&#8217;ve come to meet that are maybe sitting on the fence and they don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s okay to try and give back or, or try and do kind of social good. There&#8217;s a lot of people who are in the generation ahead of us, and they&#8217;re out there wondering if they should help. Now&#8217;s the time to do it.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
There&#8217;s, there&#8217;s never been more attention and focus on equity and diversity than now. And the numbers are starting to move. So if you&#8217;re from kind of that older generation and you&#8217;re, you&#8217;ve already made it and you&#8217;re on the fence about whether or not, you should try and invest in this, do it now. Like this is the time to come out and like help the next generation. We need more heroes out there and I know you&#8217;re out there. I know that there&#8217;s multiple people who come from the generation before me, who can have an impact in the up and coming generation. So please, I&#8217;m begging you. Just go do that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
All right. Well again, Nick Caldwell, thank you for coming on the show, man. I really appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Nick Caldwell</b>:<br>
Yeah, thanks for having me. I had a great time.</p>

<p>I first learned about Erwin Hines last year when <a href="https://28daysoftheweb.com/2019/erwin-hines/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">we profiled him for 28 Days of the Web</a>. He serves as creative director at <a href="https://basicagency.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">BASIC<sup>¬Æ</sup></a>, a branding and experience design agency that builds digital products and services that turn cultural values into company value. Creative direction is definitely a great fit for Erwin, as you&#8217;ll discover as you learn more about his story.</p>
<p>We talked about Erwin&#8217;s upbringing in Cleveland, and he shared the moment that he knew design was his calling. Erwin also spoke a lot about fellowship and empathy, including how the spaces we create &#8212; even digital ones! &#8212; can uplift a community. He even hipped me onto the San Diego creative scene, including his latest project &#8212; a monthly pop-up series called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/experiencecrafted/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Crafted</a>. Erwin is proud of where he comes from and who he is, and he represents that clearly through his work and by reinvesting in the community that supports him. It&#8217;s a great message for Black History Month that I hope will inspire you!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
My name is Erwin Hines and I am a creative director or one of the two creative directors at BASIC Agency. Our headquarters are located in San Diego, but we have offices in Mountain View as well as St. Louis.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nice. Talk to me about your work at BASIC. What&#8217;s an average day like for you there?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Oh, man. My role as a creative director is different from some of the other creative directors at the agency&#8217;s role. We each kind of focus on our unique specialty. It&#8217;s pretty expansive. I focus a lot on client work of course. And so that just involves managing teams of two to maybe five people and guiding the process throughout the duration or the lifetime of a specific project with one of our clients and doing all of the initial strategy. And so at BASIC, we don&#8217;t necessarily have a traditional strategy department. We expect all of our creatives to actually dive deep into strategy. That&#8217;s understanding the different cultural nuances of the client&#8217;s audience and making sure that we are making those unique connections based on what the client&#8217;s goals are and what the audience actually values.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
At the base level, that&#8217;s one of my roles at BASIC, but since I&#8217;ve been there for seven years, was one of the original people at the company, I&#8217;ve also really taken it upon myself to help guide the brand as a whole. As an agency, we don&#8217;t necessarily just view ourselves just as a service company. We also view ourselves as a brand that we&#8217;re constantly trying to build. One of our products that we deliver is our service, right? We&#8217;re very inspired by brands like Nike of course. And so my other role is really heading up what our brand looks like, what our brand feels like, what our brand sounds like, and then all of our different community initiatives that we do.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Our podcast, Brand Beats, that&#8217;s one of the things I kind of head up. Then we also have a community series called Crafted that was actually built to help bring together the different creatives within San Diego and help them to rub shoulders and break down the barriers between the different industries or creative verticals. And so I do a lot of community stuff as well as the client stuff. So again, it&#8217;s pretty expansive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
That is really expansive. One thing that you just touched on there, which I thought was interesting, is that you expect the creatives &#8230; I&#8217;m imagining these are individual contributors, right?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
You expect them to get into the strategy. Often that strategy part tends to be reserved for maybe someone higher up the ranks, like maybe a creative director or art director. Why did you all decide to take that approach?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
I think it came out of necessity. When I joined, there was only five people, so all projects, we had to wear a lot of hats. I joined as a senior designer, but as a senior designer, I had to come in and build brands and all of that stuff and we didn&#8217;t have a strategy department. And what we realize is that having that designer or that creative from the very beginning thinking about the brand strategy, thinking about how the brands needs need to be met and/or what the consumer&#8217;s actual desire is and how the product that we&#8217;re trying to market or trying to build a digital experience for actually meets that consumer&#8217;s need, and having the designer onboard from the very beginning just creates a stronger, more seamless kind of project and process as well as just a stronger experience in the end. And so it&#8217;s just sort of stayed that way because we realize the value in it from the beginning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
And now with one of the products of BASIC kind of being the service that you deliver, is that something that came as sort of an organic evolution of the agency?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Yeah, I would say so. And I think again, it&#8217;s mainly because we like to view ourselves as a brand, and all great brands, the things that they create add to their larger sort of why, their larger sort of essence and their larger perspective. And so we like to make sure we&#8217;re always considering what is our larger perspective, what is our why as a company and how are we bringing that forward through the work we do. And probably that also comes from the fact that we build a lot of brands for our clients and we always tell them to start with the why, understand why you exist, what your customer wants, and then make sure you&#8217;re delivering on that constantly. And then all of the things that you do are just really an ecosystem of consumer touch points that reflect your why. And so I think we just internalize that ourselves and try and make sure that we&#8217;re constantly focusing on refining and defining our why so that our work at the end of the day can become stronger.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
How did you first get started at BASIC?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Seven years ago, I was actually doing freelance. And so I was freelancing, working at home, not working with anybody, not working with other designers, just working with clients, and I was doing that for about six months. I started to get very, very restless because before that I hadn&#8217;t been at a couple other agencies so I was always able to toss ideas off of people, always able to feed off of the other creative energy, and I thought I would really, really love that freelance lifestyle where I get to do anything I wanted and hang out all day and take whatever days I wanted off and all of that stuff. But after six months, I, again, started to feel a little bit stir-crazy. I didn&#8217;t have people to toss ideas off of, and BASIC actually reached out to me because I was doing some freelance work through an ex-employee of BASIC. And so through that ex-employee, Matt Faulk, who owns BASIC, actually saw my work and decided to reach out to me.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
And at first, so a little bit of a funny story. There&#8217;s actually a pizza place in San Diego that&#8217;s really big called BASIC and it was located across the street from the agency I had previously worked at and we would go there every single day. So when BASIC reached out to me via email, at first I thought it was a pizza company asking for me to become a designer at the pizza company. And at that point my freelance work was Activision, Sony. I had big clients as a freelancer. And so I was like, &#8220;No, why would I ever want to meet with these people?&#8221; But because it came through the referral of one of my other freelance clients, I decided to go meet with them and was pleasantly surprised that it was an agency that was doing amazing work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Now, talk to me about the team that you&#8217;re working with here, because I would imagine after seven years the agency has went through a lot of changes, you probably went through a lot of changes as a professional. What&#8217;s your make-up like now?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
I was going to say we do. So I think there&#8217;s two answers to that question. One is over the years, we didn&#8217;t focus on this and this wasn&#8217;t a thing we tried to do, but because the company is ran by a black man, so Matt Faulk is black and then a lot of the leadership is black as well as women, we&#8217;ve actually created a very, very diverse team with people from all over the world, all different cultures, all different perspective. And that was just because we truly valued different ideas and different perspectives coming together in one space and felt like that collision of differing perspectives and ideas actually fosters better work, right?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
So that was the perspective we had every time we would hire someone new. We were like, &#8220;Do you challenge us? Do you come with something different?&#8221; And if they did, that&#8217;s when we knew that this was the right person. Of course, taste level, great work, great portfolio, all of that stuff was like table stakes. Yes, have all of that stuff, but you have to challenge us. And so that&#8217;s why I was like, &#8220;Please ask that question again,&#8221; because I had to make sure I gave this a proper response.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Again, that&#8217;s one side. And then as far as the make-up of the team, it&#8217;s pretty standard. We have about &#8230; I&#8217;m going to probably mess up the numbers &#8230; We probably have about 35 people in our San Diego office, 40 to 50 people in the Mountain View office, and then we have like eight people in our St. Louis office. And so the St. Louis office is really an extension of the San Diego office. It supports a lot of the work that we do in San Diego. And then the Mountain View office is really just focused on Google, and then some of our other sort of Bay Area clients, but their main focus is Google.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
And so that team make-up is a lot different than the team make-up in San Diego. The team make-up in San Diego is project-based for individual clients. So you&#8217;ll have teams of three or four. We like to try and keep them small so they can be a lot more agile and nimble as well as allow all of the designers to really have direct contact with the clients. That way, there&#8217;s no hidden people, right? We always want to kind of elevate and empower all of our creatives, like I was saying with strategy, to really be the face of the company and to be able to someday lead their own projects. That&#8217;s really our goal, right? We really want to make sure that each person grows. We have junior designers, senior designers, art directors, creative director, and then we have kind of the higher level leadership team that helps guide and really think through the vision and mission of the entire agency.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
All of those departments and all of those groups, we do our best to work seamlessly together. We strategically have set meetings so that whatever the leadership talks about can then be distilled down and shared to the rest of the team as well as we have methods for communication in the other way. So we can take things that maybe a new designer comes in and has some frustration points or some tension points with some points in the culture and all of this other stuff and maybe has some great ideas. We have tools and really it&#8217;s just talking, but we have tools, that allow that new designer&#8217;s frustrations or ideas to bubble up to the surface to the leadership team, and that&#8217;s how a lot of stuff at BASIC is really done. It&#8217;s more so done from the younger creatives or from the ground level as opposed to top down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s an interesting kind of model and it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve noticed as I honestly am interviewing and hiring creatives and stuff is that there certainly is more, at least I&#8217;m finding that there&#8217;s more of a need to have designers that have sort of led projects in that way, maybe not necessarily from end to end, but they were more than just, say, a team member that did visual design. They actually had a project or part of a project that they really got to completely oversee. So it&#8217;s good that you&#8217;ve got the agency kind of structured in that way to work with clients.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Yeah, and I think also, it benefits us at the end of the day and of course, the designers, because then these creatives are well-versed if there has to be a shift in our agency. They&#8217;re not just trained in one skillset. We like to say they&#8217;re trained in brand building, which extends past websites, extends past UX, extends past whatever new medium or media type there will be. But now you understand the foundations of how to build a company that resonates with people. And then whatever that company needs in order to speak to that audience, we can create it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
And now speaking of clients and projects, one of the clients you&#8217;re working with are the Webby Awards, which people know from &#8230; I don&#8217;t know if I even mentioned this on the show, but I&#8217;m one of the judges this year. How did you all end up working with them?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
That was an honor because they honestly just reached out to us. They didn&#8217;t do any pitching process. They just reached out to us because we have won so many Webby Awards within the digital category over the past five years. And so I think because of that, they looked at us firstly but then they also saw the quality of our work and our focus on really elevating the brand and trying to define new UX patterns because we went a lot in best practices and we do that by trying to look at and understand and really pull forward what your brand&#8217;s actual unique value proposition is, what your brand&#8217;s mission is, very similar to when people are creating a retail experience for Ralph Lauren or when people are creating a retail experience for Off-White.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Those stores look different because they&#8217;re trying to express what is inherently different about that brand, and far too long, digital experiences, we&#8217;re moving away from that because everybody was sort of moving to these templatized systems because they were deemed as easier to use. And so I think that we came in because we started &#8230; the agency started doing at the very foundation was mainly branding and I think that&#8217;s why we approach all of our projects with a very, very brand-heavy mindset. And so they saw that we really hone in on what that brand&#8217;s message is, what the nugget of truth is and pull that forward into the digital experience to create something that is still very, very easy, simple to use, but also has just a touch of difference, something that expresses that brand.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
What are the best types of clients for you to work for?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
I honestly think for me all clients are the best type of clients. That might sound like a cop-out answer, but the-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
It&#8217;s a little bit of a cop-out answer. I was going to push back on that.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
No. I was going to say, the reason I say that, because I mean, obviously I have ideal clients. The ideal client is somebody who wants to be super open and super collaborative, challenges us, very similar to what we look for when we look for new employees. It&#8217;s almost the same as when we look for our ideal client, right? We want to be challenged. We want to be pushed. We want this work to be the best work that we&#8217;ve ever done. Not saying that it needs to be the craziest design, but it expresses your brand, it tells your story and you want to push us because you know your industry better than we do, and we know digital maybe better than you do. That&#8217;s what we really look for when we&#8217;re looking for relationships.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
The reason I say all clients is only because I&#8217;ve been in situations where at first I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to work with this type of client,&#8221; or, &#8220;This type of client is really, really frustrating,&#8221; but just based on my time being in this industry or maybe it just comes from my me being a black man in America, just realizing that most situations are not easy and I&#8217;d rather look at it as an opportunity to learn and grow than ever a challenge that I need to run from. And so even those clients that are super challenging, I think I learn something new, I learn how to look at something new, I learn how to navigate a new area or a new industry or a new client and deliver something good at the end of the day.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
And as an agency in general, because our product that we deliver at the end of the day is this service of design, we look at our clients who&#8217;s reaching out to us really as our consumer or a customer and we try and understand their latent needs. We try and understand what&#8217;s frustrating them about their company, what hierarchy they have to go through, what pushback they&#8217;re getting. We don&#8217;t look at our project in a silo saying, &#8220;We have to get this through and all this stuff.&#8221; We really try and understand what the client is going through, what the individual, the person, is going through at that organization so we can help them at the end of the day.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
At the end of the day, their goal is to create this product, get this website done, get this digital experience done, get this brand done so that they can help their company be successful, ultimately helping them be successful. And so we try and understand their pathway of growth and all of that stuff. I think that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Every client is great,&#8221; because every client is a person and at the end of the day, we&#8217;re here to help people, not just create websites.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Gotcha. Great explanation there. I like that. Let&#8217;s just switch gears. And talk about your work at BASIC, and I do want to get more into some of the community work, but tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Actually, I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Ah.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Yeah. Grew up in Cleveland, Ohio. Love it still. Just can&#8217;t move back there mainly because there&#8217;s not the job opportunities, although it is having this really awesome resurgence. Every time I go back, which is only once a year and it&#8217;s during the winter, so it&#8217;s probably not the best time to come back from San Diego that&#8217;s always sunny, but every time I go back it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s something new. There&#8217;s new energy. There&#8217;s new creatives moving into that city. So every time I go back it is cool and it makes me miss it, but again, I can&#8217;t move back purely because of the industry and now my investment in San Diego.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah, that makes sense. For folks that have listened to the show for a while, they know I&#8217;ve got family in Cleveland. My dad&#8217;s side of the family is from Cleveland, Shaker Heights.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
What?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Oh wow. Yes. Most of my family, my dad&#8217;s side all grew up in Shaker. I grew up in Beachwood. So if you have family that is from Shaker, I feel like there could be a connection. They might know them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Probably so.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
My family is heavily involved in community stuff in Cleveland and they were a family of five or six in the Shaker school system, and so they had somebody in almost every grade. There probably is some overlap.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I think there probably is. Yeah. Growing up there, I mean, was creativity a big part of your childhood?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Yes, I would definitely say so. I think I always had an inkling for creative. My family would push me into doing sports. I think that was just by default what my family did. Everybody played sports. Everybody was good at sports, and so on top of me wanting to be creative and my parents supporting that, so they put me in art classes, they encouraged me to try music, although I sucked. I tried to play trumpet, the worst experience. And at some point I actually thought I could sing and I thought I could play piano but it was just me playing on my parents&#8217; piano and I&#8217;ll be in the living room singing and trying to play.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
I think about it now and that had to be so cringeworthy, and my parents wouldn&#8217;t yell at me. They would just let me do it. So I think I had very, very supportive parents when it came to exploring my creativity. But again, I was also pushed to do sports. But in high school, I actually dabbled in pattern-making. I really, really loved clothing and creating my own clothes. So that was my main form of creative expression throughout high school was making clothes or making shoes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Oh really? Wow.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Yeah. I viewed that as &#8230; I drew and stuff when I was younger, super young, but then as soon as I got into high school and I touched the sewing machine, I was like, &#8220;Oh, this is dope. I can create the things that I put on my body. I don&#8217;t have to wear other people&#8217;s stuff.&#8221; That was so cool to me and I viewed it as this living testament to who you are inside, so it was like this walking billboard of sorts. Billboards sound so markety, but the reality is this walking art piece. I always found that very powerful. I didn&#8217;t realize the power of it. I think I liked it on a very shallow level, but there was power in creating something that I was going to put in my body or that other people desire to put on their body.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
When did you sort of know then &#8230; I mean, with not only this exposure that your parents supported, but even now you&#8217;re talking about fashion and apparel and stuff like that &#8230; when did you kind of know, &#8220;Oh, this is something I could do for a living&#8221;?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
I actually didn&#8217;t know that until my second half year in college. Well, because my parents supported it, but it wasn&#8217;t like &#8230; I didn&#8217;t have any patterns to look at when it came to a designer. I didn&#8217;t know any designers. I didn&#8217;t know anybody who made it in fashion design or I didn&#8217;t even realize fashion design was a thing. I was doing it, but I didn&#8217;t realize it was like a thing. I never fathomed that. My access to creative profession was actually architecture and so on top of doing fashion stuff in high school, I also did a lot of CAD and took architecture classes and that was mainly due to the &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
&#8230; classes. And that was mainly due to the fact that I had exposure because my parents owned a development company and so I saw it. And that was like, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t really&#8230;&#8221; I saw construction as a place I can go in my &#8230; So my parents owned a development company and then my grandparents on my father&#8217;s side owned a successful exterminating company and landscaping company. I&#8217;m sorry, my grandparents on my father&#8217;s side owned the landscaping company, my grandparents on my mother&#8217;s side owned the successful exterminating company. So those were like the pathways that I was exposed to on top of doctors and all of that stuff, but those were the entrepreneurial pathways that I saw.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
And so out of all of those I was like, &#8220;Oh designing landscaping, like a landscape architect, that&#8217;s kind of cool.&#8221; Or designing a home where people can live and creating these spaces that impacts your emotions and, and all of that stuff, I found that deeply interesting. So I took some architecture classes in high school just to learn CAD and I also did like my senior project at my parents&#8217; company with the architect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s convenient.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Yeah. That was super convenient. But again, it was basically what I was exposed to. It made my path way longer to get to realizing that design was a thing I could do. So then my first year in college I studied&#8230; Or my focus was construction management. And with that I wanted to really focus on this idea of architecture or city planning. And that was partially due to the fact that when I was seeing my parents build these homes, so they build homes in&#8230; They built affordable housing in the inner city and when I saw them doing that, and then we would actually go back and always meet with and talk to all of the people that we build homes for to help maintain them because we also had the landscaping business, and we also had the exterminating business. So we would actually help these people maintain their homes. And it was amazing just the connections and then the joy that we would see on these people&#8217;s face, right?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
And I think I was very, very impacted by that, the fact that again, space things that we create can uplift a community. That to me was like, &#8220;What the heck? This is incredible, this is incredible.&#8221; And so that&#8217;s what took me in this space of really trying to pursue architecture or city planning. And my whole thing of city planning was like how do you actually create spaces and cities that are equitable for both the privileged and the underprivileged and how do you bridge that gap between those two to actually begin to create some empathy so people understand the other side? To me empathy is the biggest thing in the world because once you have a sense of understanding, true understanding, not just like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I know what you&#8217;re saying but I don&#8217;t care.&#8221; Once you have true empathy from both sides, then we can begin to push forward and work together to create equitable solutions for everybody. That might be hella idealistic, but that was my mission, my goal, my vision. But-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I feel like nowadays what they called that, service design or something to that effect. So you were ahead of the curve there?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Yeah, except the only challenge was I hated math. I hated it. So been like I&#8217;m there, I&#8217;m designing cool things, but none of them can be built so my teachers are like, &#8220;You know, you can&#8217;t make this at all.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;But it will be cool though, if you could, right? Right?&#8221; And so my first year in college, that was happening and then I also took art history classes. And I had never ever taken an art history class so I didn&#8217;t understand the history of art, I didn&#8217;t understand the story of art, I didn&#8217;t understand the depths of art really before I went to college. So that first year I also took an art history class.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
In that class they&#8217;re teaching us about like Basquiat, they&#8217;re teaching us about Picasso, so they&#8217;re teaching us about&#8230; It was a very in depth all history of art. And they&#8217;re talking about the impact that each one of these artists had had and how they were&#8230; And this is something that I took away, where it&#8217;s like every single artist was&#8230; every great artist was basically acting as a mirror reflecting society&#8217;s ills back to itself so that society could actually digest it and understand it. Because in our day to day life, we move so fast, we don&#8217;t actually take time to sit and think and see what&#8217;s happening in front of us. And the purpose of art has been to create and take a moment and take a chunk of time and give it to us in a digestible way so that we actually can understand what&#8217;s happening, right?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
So great writing, great podcasts, great anything, and I&#8217;m including all of these things on the umbrella of art, do that, right? They force us to have a conversation, they force us to talk, they forced us to live in a space for a moment and take us out of our day to day. And so I saw that and I was like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I don&#8217;t have to do architecture. I can just do some art to have the same level of impact.&#8221; So then I actually took time off of school and I began to just&#8230; I still didn&#8217;t know that I could do design, that still wasn&#8217;t clear to me. So I took some time off from school, about half a year and I went and hung out in my friends like dorms at UPenn and I would just go audit classes.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
And she was studying marketing and advertising and sitting there with her being able to&#8230; And sitting in those classes and hearing about branding, hearing about marketing, hearing about advertising. I was like, &#8220;Oh shoot, this is like they&#8217;re using this power to create these emotions and create these feelings and create these desires and they&#8217;re tapping into the things that make us human.&#8221; That to me became really, really interesting. Still, I didn&#8217;t know how to get into it because I definitely couldn&#8217;t get into UPenn after dropping out of college. So I went back to creating clothes. Again, that was my default. I kept making shoes and selling shoes and then one of my other friends actually saw the shoes that I was making and was like, &#8220;Hey, you should come check out the Art Institute of Pittsburgh.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Yeah, why not?&#8221; I was kind of down for whatever.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
And then I went down to Pittsburgh and met with some of the people at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. I&#8217;m not saying the Art Institute is good, I would never promote the Art Institutes. That&#8217;s just where I had to go because I didn&#8217;t have a portfolio at all. And then I actually wanted to do game design at first, and it was because they were talking to me about their courses that they had, going through all of the details. They first mentioned game design. They talked about advertising, they talked about all these other things, but game design was interesting because it wasn&#8217;t far off of what I enjoyed about architecture, which is creating these immersive spaces that people essentially live in or inhabit for a period of time. And those spaces can be used to create connections. And since games are played over the internet and it creates connections for people across the world, I was like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I totally want to do that and try and figure out a way to create healthy games that create these connections and try and build empathy with people.&#8221; But you needed a portfolio.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s like a constant theme where it&#8217;s like these are the things I wanted to do, but I didn&#8217;t have either the love of math, or I wasn&#8217;t good at math, and I didn&#8217;t have a portfolio. So then I was then forced into graphic design at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh and through my courses and through my classes actually ended up falling in love with it because once I took my branding class, again it kind of re-sparked some of the energy that I had when I was sitting in and auditing the classes at my friend&#8217;s school, where I was like, Oh, branding has immense impact. It&#8217;s not just about the beauty, it&#8217;s not just about the aesthetic, but you&#8217;re creating this entity, you&#8217;re creating this thing that if used properly will reflect and amplify the voices of the people that are supporting it. And so that&#8217;s when I knew that I was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to do this. I&#8217;m going to go hard at branding.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
That&#8217;s quite a journey.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Yeah, it was&#8230; It&#8217;s a little bit all over the place, but it has a through line.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I&#8217;m curious and I&#8217;m going to&#8230; We don&#8217;t have to dwell on it too much, but why would you never promote the Art Institute? I didn&#8217;t go to the Art Institute, I just want to be clear about that, but I&#8217;m just curious why.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Oh, I mean their [for 00:32:43] proper university has been sued mad times. And the Art Institute of Pittsburgh has actually closed down, so I don&#8217;t want people to get confused with the Chicago Institute of Art. That&#8217;s an amazing institution and it nothing to do with the Art Institutes. The Art Institutes are all for-profit and they would&#8230; They lied and they would fudge the numbers for how many people they were actually placing, which was just sad because you would see people who&#8230; They would say they had really high placement rates and there were some people who got jobs, I was somebody who got a job, but I did so much work outside of school. Everybody who got a job did so much work outside of school, but they didn&#8217;t tell you that, right?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
And if you&#8217;re a student and you&#8217;re putting your trust in an organization to teach you the skill sets and the things you need to get that job, it&#8217;s almost like, okay, if that&#8217;s a part of it, why aren&#8217;t they including that in the onboarding? Why aren&#8217;t they saying like, &#8220;Yes, you&#8217;ll have your curriculum, you&#8217;ll learn your skill sets, you&#8217;ll learn the tools, but in order to guarantee a job, you need to make sure you&#8217;re doing freelance. You need to make sure you&#8217;re going around to all of these different networking events. You need to make sure you&#8217;re collaborating with kids from Carnegie Mellon.&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying? All of those opportunities were open but it&#8217;s like I had to figure it out and open them myself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Okay. No I was curious about that for two reasons. I mean one, I like when people push back against these sort of, I don&#8217;t want to say industry standard tropes of, &#8220;You have to go to this school in order to make it as a designer.&#8221; I do think, and you know this is sort of a problem with the industry, is that there is still this notion of that you have to go to these certain schools, like you have to go to design schools to be considered a designer, essentially. I know just to tell my story a little bit, I went to HBCU, I went to Morehouse here in Atlanta. It&#8217;s funny you mentioned you didn&#8217;t like math, I majored in math.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
But my first semester I was like, &#8220;This is a lot.&#8221; And I really wanted to go into web design. I was a computer science major and I remember my professor at the time, I was telling him I wanted to do web design because I had been tinkering around with HTML, reverse engineering, so this is 1999, so this is&#8230; God, this is so long ago, this is a while ago where I was telling my advisor this and I remember him telling me how the internet is a fad, like, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t going to be around for too much longer and if this is something that you really want to put all your eggs in this basket, you should probably change your major or go to another school.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Well damn, okay.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
And at the time I wanted to go to the Art Institute because we had two art colleges here in Atlanta. We had the Art Institute of Atlanta and we had the Atlanta College of Art. The Atlanta College of Art is now closed down, now we have Savannah College of Art and Design Campus here. But for me I was like, &#8220;Yeah the Art Institutes&#8230;&#8221; Like that was it because I saw the commercials, they would have these commercials where you could see they&#8217;re doing all this stuff. And I was like, &#8220;Oh so this is where you go to learn design.&#8221; And then even later on in my career, because I&#8217;m self-taught, even later on in my career there would be these sorts of, I guess you could call them gatekeepers I suppose, I don&#8217;t know, who would say like, &#8220;Oh well you&#8217;re not a designer because you didn&#8217;t go to design school.&#8221; Like that&#8217;s the only way when clearly it&#8217;s not the only way, that&#8217;s one of the great things about this industry is that you don&#8217;t necessarily have to follow a specific path or go to these specific schools in order to be a success.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Yeah, I was going to say that&#8217;s trash. Very much so because again for me, even without the Art Institute, I think I just needed to be exposed and the Art Institute exposed me to the fact that this could be a profession, but I did all of the work on the side and on my own. You can go audit classes to learn some skills or you can learn a lot of the skills that you need on YouTube and stuff. To me, I think the main takeaways of university for me were some of the non-design classes or the classes that were more focused on theory and psychology. Those to me were the biggest helps because it expanded my mind as opposed to just expanding my skillset. And so if there is anybody who&#8217;s listening who is questioning whether they need to go to school or do I need to do this? I think as long as you&#8217;re doing things that are expanding your mind so that you understand cultural nuances and you understand again, how to look at the world differently, that to me is what, as a designer, university is really good for.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Gotcha. So from Pittsburgh to San Diego, that&#8217;s a trek. Well really from Cleveland to Pittsburgh, to San Diego, that&#8217;s kind of a trek. When you look back at your career, because I did my research, I saw you&#8217;ve worked at a few agencies, at Nobis, Modifly, you did some work for Digitaria, etc. When you look back at your career, what did each of those places teach you? Did you walk away from those experiences with a nugget of information that you take with you now?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Yeah, I would definitely say I did. I think whether it be good or bad, I definitely learned something from each of those experiences. So Modifly and some of the other ones were just freelance clients. I was the dedicated creative but they were mainly freelance so it wasn&#8217;t necessary major learning experiences, right? Other than continuing to hone my craft. Whereas Nobis Interactive, I was also the only creative and was brought in as a Creative Director and it was to help lead and build out this brand. And I think one of the things that I learned from that was the importance of good leadership and the importance of a strong founder. And [inaudible 00:38:42] Nobis actually didn&#8217;t have that and I think that&#8217;s why I learned it, because I saw what lacked in the experience and how it kind of destroyed the organization and the company. And so from that it&#8217;s just how to be a good leader by doing everything opposite of what that leader did. And how to be honest, right? And making sure that you&#8217;re inspiring your team.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
And then when I went to Digitaria, that was learning how to manage growth because when I went to Digitaria, it was still relatively small, it had just gotten purchased by JWT, and over the time that I was there it expanded rapidly and what ended up happening was you kind of lose some of that design-forward culture. And the the owners knew that, their focus was expansion, growth and almost taking over and becoming their own holding company. That was their goal and they&#8217;ve done that so now they&#8217;re called Mirum, and Mirum is bought out a bunch of other digital agencies and then Digitaria became Mirum, which is the holding company of all those other digital agencies. So they were super successful in that goal, but I saw the sacrifice of creative to be this bigger entity.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
And so I think it was&#8230; From there it was making sure that when I go to the next organization that we managed growth properly so that we don&#8217;t lose culture because when you lose culture, you have high attrition, attrition costs more than keeping people as well as a cost your work. If your work is your product and if you lose all of those people then your product suffers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Yeah. That is so true, I see that now in a lot of startups, a lot of tech startups usually where that&#8217;s the case. There&#8217;s been this sometimes over-indexing on culture fit, and oftentimes when bad things happen at a company like that and it&#8217;s to the detriment of the product, it&#8217;s to the detriment of the people that work there, it&#8217;s pervasive when stuff like that happens.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Now you&#8217;re in San Diego, which, and we talked about this before recording, I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think of&#8230;&#8221; When I think of San Diego, I don&#8217;t think of design or culture, but San Diego&#8217;s one of the 10 largest cities in the US, which I don&#8217;t know if a lot of people know that, but I&#8217;m curious to learn more about your community work there. You said through BASIC that you all are kind of&#8230; I guess you did this community series in San Diego. Can you talk a little bit about that?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Yeah. All right, so I&#8217;ve been in San Diego for 10 years. When I first moved here, moving from Pittsburgh where you had gallery crawls once a month or spending time in New York a lot where you just have a lot of culture, just a lot of creative culture. And then even touching LA, it was like there&#8217;s just an energy and a vibe. When I moved here 10 years ago, I was looking for those things and then all I could find was like, &#8220;Okay, there&#8217;s breweries and there&#8217;s beaches, okay.&#8221; Which is super cool for a little bit, especially when you feel like you&#8217;re a city boy and yeah, I liked the beach, I&#8217;m going to sound ungrateful, the beach is nice, but at the same time as a creative, I need that creative energy.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
So when I first moved here there was nothing, and over the years, especially within the past three or four years, I began to realize how wrong I was and just how hidden the energy and the vibe was in San Diego. It was like you had to know. You had to know the people, you had to know what&#8217;s going on in order to find it. So it was a lot more about the underground scene in San Diego and it was just hard to find. And then within the past like two years, that underground scene has started to really bubble up.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
And so when we talk about what is the creative scene in San Diego, we have some of the best poets in the world, like our poetry society wins nationals all of the time. We have some of the best dancers in the world. There&#8217;s two dancers in San Diego who do choreography for Justin Bieber, they have a new Broadway show, they do stuff for Brittany Spears, but they live in San Diego. And then we also have some amazing other dancers, traditional urban as well as classical ballet. Then we have amazing chefs and an amazing culinary scene. And then we also have amazing creatives and amazing designers, like BASIC being one of those, but then you also have Grizzly and a few other agencies, and young creatives who are here in San Diego. And then you have amazing DJs and music.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
So you have all of these different amazing creative industries and creative spaces, but one thing that we were seeing is that they weren&#8217;t rubbing shoulders. So it kind of goes back to the thing I was saying that I had this goal since my very foundation of my creative spark, which is how do you build spaces where people can come together from different backgrounds and start to develop empathy and understanding and work together? And again, so you have all these different creatives and creative people in these different spaces and they&#8217;re all doing these amazing things, but they weren&#8217;t rubbing shoulders, there was no friction, there was no collision.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
And so we created this very simple series, or this very simple idea of just bringing 12 people together from different industries, different backgrounds, different cultures, different races together over dinner. And we used food as the medium of connection because it&#8217;s visceral, it&#8217;s easy to understand, and it caused us and sparks conversation. And so we strategically do a five course to seven course meal mainly because it creates more time. And then the food itself is never really the central focus of the time, it&#8217;s there, but really the central focus is about creating a space for conversation to happen. And these 12 people do not know each other at all, and they get free invites so no one has the pay because we want to make sure that it&#8217;s open and accessible to everybody.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
So we&#8217;ll always have a student, we&#8217;ll have somebody who works in architecture, we&#8217;ll have a scientist, we&#8217;ll have somebody who owns property within an undeveloped neighborhood, we&#8217;ll have fine artists, designers. So we&#8217;ll kind of mix and match these different groups. And then each one of the experiences, which happened monthly has a theme, and we utilize the food to connect and to make people comfortable and then the theme is utilized to create a unifying connection and conversation between everybody. And those themes are things like identity. And in that dinner, which was our dinner in December, in that dinner the theme was identity and it was about exploring the ever evolving nature of the self and what identity means to each one of us individually.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
And so we usually start off each dinner with introduce yourself and then kind of go into that line of conversation. And usually that first round of conversation is like really, really, really deep where people kind of get really personal, they expose things that they wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise exposed, and maybe it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s a group of strangers so you feel a little bit more comfortable and no one knows me here, but they&#8217;ve been really powerful mainly because it&#8217;s a small intimate group who ends up having a very deep conversation with one another. And we&#8217;ve seen a lot of people begin to work together from the different Crafted experiences, which is really the main goal. There&#8217;s no other ulterior motive other than bringing people together and then promoting and showing people that there&#8217;s other things going on in the city so you don&#8217;t have to leave.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
because we also had like high attrition of like creative talent in San Diego because a creative was like, &#8220;I do fashion but there&#8217;s no one else here doing creative stuff, I&#8217;ll just go up to LA because there&#8217;s more opportunity.&#8221; Which right now there still is more opportunity in LA obviously, there&#8217;s more people who appreciate that type of stuff. So you will have a larger consumer base as a creative in LA. But one of the things that we&#8217;re really focused on with this dinner, as well as all of the other groups who are doing really amazing things. So there&#8217;s also this group called the Traveler&#8217;s Club. There&#8217;s a group called Weird [Use 00:00:47:00], and I can go on and on with all of these different groups, but everybody is now focused on creating an opening up the doorway for opportunities for these young creatives so that they don&#8217;t have to leave.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
So that&#8217;s the dinner as well as the energy in San Diego right now is everybody is focused on building a community that can thrive and can be self sustaining. And it&#8217;s amazing because it&#8217;s really collaborative, so there&#8217;s not a lot of negative competition, if that makes sense. It&#8217;s a lot of collaborative, co-building of the community that we all want.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Nice. I might have to visit San Diego, it sounds like a lot of great energy there. Also, I mean, San Diego is right on the border to Mexico like you guys are right [crosstalk 00:47:46]</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Exactly. That&#8217;s another beautiful thing about it is we have all of this rich culture. One of the things that I find the most interesting, and we begin to talk about this a lot through our Crafted Instagram is this idea that culture is made by many and the beauty of San Diego is unlike some of-</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Whereas made by many and the beauty of San Diego is, unlike some of the places on the West coast, unlike SF or unlike LA, people come here with different perspectives and goals and backgrounds. Like a lot of people will go to SF with one perspective and one goal. So no matter what race you are, what cultural background you are, you have a specific perspective or goal. Whereas here, because you have the military, because we&#8217;re a border town because you have all the universities and the different levels of universities and then you just have random transplants who are just coming here because it&#8217;s something different or you have the people who are coming here for the beaches, you have the people who are coming here for the music.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
So you have all of these different people that it almost is akin to something like a New York where you have this really, really diverse makeup and that&#8217;s what makes the culture of New York. And to me it&#8217;s like that&#8217;s what makes the culture of San Diego is this diverse makeup and it&#8217;s just us realizing, over the past year, we&#8217;ve been realizing that that is our true power. We don&#8217;t have to just be a beach city and a brewery city. We can be a creative powerhouse.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
And this year we&#8217;re going to actually have our first design week as well. So it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s a lot of movement around San Diego and I&#8217;m happy to work at an agency that has been so invested and lets me take the reins on a lot of the community initiatives and making sure that we&#8217;re using our skill sets and our talents in authentic ways. Then we still do canned drives and all of those things, but I think we used to just do that and we started asking ourselves how do we as people who understand how to build brands start to build the brand of our own city and really give back to our community in a deeper, authentic way that lasts.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
So it&#8217;s the teach a man to fish versus just fish for them. So I think what we&#8217;re trying to do is build programs that teach people how to fish ultimately that will come back to other issues like homelessness or other issues like education because by connecting these different people you can essentially begin to affect all of those different things because you&#8217;re building empathy across these different groups. So connecting somebody who, like having somebody who maybe their family is being gentrified or they&#8217;re a part of like the gentrified class, you have them at the table with a property developer and maybe a city official and you actually allow them to have true conversation as opposed to just like yelling. That&#8217;s the main goal of of Crafted.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Are you satisfied creatively?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Oh yeah, totally. I&#8217;m more than satisfied partially because whenever I&#8217;m unsatisfied, I can just create something like Crafted. I literally just think about like, &#8220;Okay, if I&#8217;m not having that feeling of expressing empathy or the feeling of me being able to tell my true authentic story and really explore who I am. If I&#8217;m not that, then I just create another avenue and another pathway for me to have it.&#8221; So I never really rely on other people for my creative satisfaction, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
No, that makes sense. The reason I was asking that because I was talking with a friend of mine actually, her name is Diane Holton, she&#8217;s been on the show before too and we were just talking, just catching up and she was mentioning, she&#8217;s like, &#8220;You&#8217;re like Beyonce, like you don&#8217;t take your foot off our necks.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; She&#8217;s like, &#8220;You&#8217;re doing this revision path and now you&#8217;ve got this anthology series coming out and stuff.&#8221; And for me, when I&#8217;m doing these things and essentially you mentioned, you sort of see the void and you figure out like, how can I fill the void with something that can help? So with me with the anthology, I was like, there&#8217;s not a lot of people of color and indigenous people doing enough writing about design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
You go to a bookstore and you look in the arts or design section, there are very few, if any, book in there from people of color, definitely not from black people. And it&#8217;s like where does that begin? It begins with just writing an essay and getting the feedback from people and then building on that and you know I think now certainly with technology it&#8217;s easier than ever to start up a blog and put your thoughts out there. One thing that I&#8217;m experimenting with this year is getting back to blogging. I used to blog a lot in the early 2000s and stuff and I&#8217;m thinking about getting back out there now because it&#8217;s so much easier to just get your thoughts out. Before, when I was blogging back in the day, you had to know how to have a MySQL database and install it to the database and then run the installation and then keep up with all this and you have to have hosting and a domain and all this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
And now I use this tool called Notion, which is sort of like this all in one work place. It&#8217;s like Evernote and Trello and all these things had a baby and it&#8217;s Notion. And you can blog from Notion, so write a page and you can set the page to public and then because it&#8217;s all in the cloud or whatever, but you can set that page to public and then just have people read your stuff. And it&#8217;s like I have all my projects, I have all revision path recognize all my stuff in Notion and then I&#8217;ve got a little separate thing that&#8217;s going to be the blog that I&#8217;m going to start and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I can just write while I&#8217;m in here and publish and it&#8217;s so easy.&#8221; But I get what you mean about if there&#8217;s something that&#8217;s not fulfilling you, then you find a way to kind of get that [crosstalk 00:53:36].</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Get fulfilled. Yeah. Yeah, and I actually love what you&#8217;re just saying. I think that that&#8217;s one of the biggest things within our industry that we&#8217;ve started to see in almost every other creative industry. So you start to see it in fashion and it&#8217;s being led by these black designers and I know that they probably wouldn&#8217;t want you to call them black designers because no one wants to be pigeonholed and I hate being called a black designer because it feels like, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re just trying to say I&#8217;m good for that,&#8221; as opposed to just being like, I&#8217;m a good designer and I happen to have a very rich narrative that helps guide everything I do that you might not have. But what you&#8217;re saying about how we need more of that, we need more of that story within this industry, within the design world. Because for far too long, it hasn&#8217;t been there, but we&#8217;re here.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
But it almost feels like, within this industry, it almost feels like we&#8217;re a minority group who&#8217;s just pushed to the side and it&#8217;s not about us. You know what I&#8217;m saying? It&#8217;s strange because the level of importance that, specifically for me, like black people have had within the building of America and what America is and what America pop culture is. A lot of stuff is based on pop culture and the nuances of pop culture and all of that stuff and we kind of create that and our people create that. We create the vibe of coolness that drives commerce around the world, but people don&#8217;t want to recognize that and so I think it&#8217;s important. What you&#8217;re doing, hella important because it begins to shine light on the importance of these views and understanding these views and takes us out of just the, maybe a young black kid reads it and it helps to take them out of just the consumer mindset of just I&#8217;m going to consume, consume, consume. I can actually create.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
These platforms like Instagram and all of those things became popular off of the content that youth create. A lot of those youth are young black kids. They&#8217;re creating content for an organization that they don&#8217;t even know that they can work at or that they don&#8217;t even know that they can build themselves. And so I think it&#8217;s just showing that pathway. Going back to what I was saying at the very beginning where I didn&#8217;t even know things existed because I wasn&#8217;t exposed to it and so, by what you&#8217;re doing, you&#8217;re helping give that exposure, hoping that young kids are listening to this stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
I hope so man. Hope they&#8217;re listening. Hope they&#8217;re reading. And not even that I would say just young kids because that exposure can really come at any age.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Yeah, true.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Just to know that the option is out there or that there can be something different, that can really come at it at any age. But yeah. What piece of advice has stuck with you the longest when you think back over your career, you think over your creative journey? What is that advice?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Ooh, so I never had a specific mentor ever in my creative journey and I think it&#8217;s just because I was a knucklehead so I never looked for mentors. I would just always listen to interviews from Kanye West or whatever creative I&#8217;m super inspired by at that time, but the biggest nugget of truth that I ever received was from my family that just was about&#8230; My father one time said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like who you&#8217;re becoming.&#8221; And it was when I was losing myself for a little bit and I wasn&#8217;t necessarily thinking about my heritage and my past and my upbringing. And to me that conversation is the conversation that has stuck with me and helped to guide me.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Although my father probably wouldn&#8217;t remember this, but that one moment and then the conversation that followed about making sure that you&#8217;re checking with your heritage, making sure that you&#8217;re checking with the things of your past, the things that your grandfather did, the things that both sides of the family have done for me. It didn&#8217;t put a burden on my shoulder, it actually made me proud of who I am, where I come from. And it made me want to truly honor that.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
So that was probably be the biggest piece of advice. Again, I think I&#8217;m somebody who looks and desires to look for inspiration outside of my industry. I have never really looked at other design and other designers for my pathway. I really love to understand and look at culture because the things that we&#8217;re creating are all for culture. And so even with creatives, my biggest inspirations are people in the world of fashion or the world of music. So it&#8217;d be Kirby from Pierre Moss or Virgil. Those, to me, are some of my biggest inspirations because they stand for breaking down barriers and walls just by being fucking good. I don&#8217;t know if you can curse on this, so I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Oh, yeah. You can curse. That&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
All right. Just by being good at what they do and they move with theory and a message. And that to me is my biggest inspiration, is the idea of moving with theory, moving with a message that is consistent and it might evolve over time, but there&#8217;s always substance there. Yeah. And so for me it&#8217;s a combination of what my father said as well as growing up. I think I&#8217;ve always been really proud of being a black man, no matter where I was or how I grew up and I grew up in a predominantly white neighborhood. But I would walk around school, my predominantly white school, with my fist in the air because I was just super proud of who I am and where I came from. And I think it was because, on top of what the media would show you and all the negativity that the media would showing you about being a young black man and how you can just be a rapper or you can just be this and that&#8217;s all you would see or the criminalization of black people.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
My parents had these books, I forgot what they&#8217;re called, but we got these books every single month, yeah, these books every single month that would just dive into one impactful African American. And so seeing those stories of Booker T. Washington and getting to see this diversity or Harriet Tubman. Seeing those things at a very young age, I got to see the diversity of black people and that we exist on a spectrum, a very large spectrum and we&#8217;re not just a homogenous group. So I had an early realization that I didn&#8217;t have to try and be black, I just was black and that blackness can exist on a very large spectrum, but it&#8217;s still impactful and it still carries the same narrative story, but my experiences are going to add to that history and that legacy to create something unique.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
But I need to make sure that I carry all of that with me into every room I go to, into every time I&#8217;m sitting with a CEO or a C Suite person at Google. I need to bring with me the legacy and heritage of blackness and be proud of it and speak with the strength of that heritage.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Wow. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing in 2025?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
So me and a couple of my friends actually started another project that&#8217;s actually building a restaurant group. We have two restaurants, one is actually opening, they&#8217;re actually building it currently. One is opening at the beginning of 2021. There&#8217;s another one that&#8217;s opening in October and then we have a retail space that&#8217;s opening next month. And so that to me is the next project and it stems from Crafted, which is again, like this space.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
And just to put a little bit more color around it, I actually explained Crafted as a living art experience that uses space and food and art to create empathy between disparate groups of people. And for me, going back to what I view art as, art, the true end goal of art, is not to create something beautiful, it&#8217;s actually to create opportunity for conversation. That conversation can create change, but in a conversationless society that silos us through algorithms, conversations between disparate groups of people stopped happening and therefore it limits the amount of change that we can have, impactful change. So Crafted was that opportunity for me to create a space for conversation between disparate groups of people to create change and so extending that, we&#8217;re looking at how we can actually go into some of these different neighborhoods.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
So the chef and the guy who actually is going to own these different properties, so I&#8217;m a partner in it, but the main owner, he&#8217;s from this neighborhood called National City. And for him, he grew up there, but he always had to leave there to go to restaurants or to go to coffee shops or to go anywhere, which removes that sense of pride in your neighborhood and when you have a sense of pride in your neighborhood, then people begin to invest more, invest more time and invest more energy into that neighborhood. It&#8217;s very similar to what we&#8217;re seeing now in San Diego. Now that they see all of these different things are going on, people are more proud to be in San Diego and then they&#8217;re more likely to invest, more likely to stay. And so what we&#8217;re trying to do in this neighborhood called National City, where all of our three concepts are actually opening on one street, is trying to create a sense of pride in that neighborhood, so people feel prideful, they want to stay and they want to reinvest into the community.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
And so it&#8217;s almost how do you move into a neighborhood, or not even move in because he&#8217;s from there, but how do you reinvest into your community without it ever having the need to be gentrified? So I think we&#8217;re trying to&#8230; For me that&#8217;s my thing is how do we figure out this fucking gentrification problem and it&#8217;s almost going back to my passion for city plan, or not passionate, but what my goal of city planning was. It&#8217;s going back to these things that I had from the very beginning, which is how do you create equitable living spaces and make sure that you&#8217;re fostering opportunities for conversation to create empathy. And so over the next couple of years we&#8217;re going to be launching those three projects and then from there who knows, we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
It&#8217;s probably going to be more stuff like that. How do I just get deeper involved in helping to build true community? Yeah. And reinvest in the community. I&#8217;m big on community right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>

And that&#8217;s on Twitter, Instagram?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
This is all on Instagram. I mainly use Instagram partially because I&#8217;m managing a lot of different social accounts and I can&#8217;t be going back and forth between Twitter, Instagram. I find Instagram my main space to create conversation.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
So yeah, definitely the main thing I would encourage people to follow is probably the Experience Crafted Instagram just because that&#8217;s where I put a lot of my time, a lot of my effort outside of BASIC¬Æ.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
Sounds good. Well Irwin Hines, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I mean, I sort of had an idea when I started this conversation kind of where things would go, but you blew my mind. Finding out more about your background and seeing how, now you&#8217;ve been able to weave all of these disparate experiences and influences into your story and then use that to guide your work and go back out and give to the community, it is such an inspiring thing to hear. One of the themes that I&#8217;m trying to carry throughout the year is basically, how are we as black designers helping to build a more equitable future?</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Whoa. That&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
And I feel that certainly you are doing it. One, through your design and branding work, but then also through experience Crafted and then through these actual physical spaces, these restaurants and retail space. When they say people out here doing it for the culture, you&#8217;re out here doing it for the culture. So thank you so much-</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:<br>
-for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Erwin Hines</b>:<br>
Thank you man. And if I could leave with one last thing, it actually goes to exactly what you were just saying. I think and I feel, and I&#8217;ve had a conversation with other people of color in general, that from a very young age, since we grew up in America, we were actually forced to learn empathy and a sense of understanding of people outside of ourselves before we even were able to understand ourselves. And so I think that that is a very, very powerful tool set as a creative to have in our tool belt because we can approach every single thing with a broader understanding and bringing that and making sure you&#8217;re bringing that and making sure you&#8217;re not shying away from it, to me, would be like the one thing I hope that people would move forward with.</p>

<p>I only recently heard about Joshua Leonard, but I had no idea about his inspiring life story until we sat down for this interview. Joshua is currently doing freelance animation work for Nickelodeon, but he is perhaps most well known for Team Supreme ‚Äî a group of differently abled super-powered kids!</p>
<p>Joshua started our conversation with a little behind-the-scenes look at working with Nickelodeon, and we talked a bit about different animation styles and how long it can take a concept to go from idea to reality. Joshua also talked about growing up as a military brat, his early animation influences, and about evacuating Hurricane Katrina to make a new start in Atlanta. I don&#8217;t want to give away too much about our conversation, but make sure you stick around for Joshua&#8217;s words of wisdom in the second half of the interview, as well as an update on the status of Team Supreme! Joshua&#8217;s work has already caught the eye of some major players, and I&#8217;m so proud to be able to share what he&#8217;s doing here on Revision Path!</p>

<span class="thst-toggle-title">Full Transcript</span><div class="thst-toggle-inner">
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      All right. Tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Yeah. My name is Joshua Leonard and I&#8217;m a 2D animator and a character designer and I&#8217;m the creator of Team Supreme, which is an animated series in the works right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      All right. We&#8217;ll definitely get into talking more about Team Supreme. What&#8217;s your kind of average day-to-day work with like right now?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Well, I wake up, first thing first, go to the gym, workout for about an hour, come home, do some character design work. I do freelance for Nickelodeon right now, really just working on Team Supreme. That&#8217;s really it. And the Joshua Leonard Foundation, we&#8217;re getting that up and running, so I just try to stay as productive as I possibly can-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Okay.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      &#8230; until everything starts to kind of really take off.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      So with the freelance character design stuff for Nickelodeon, can you talk just a little bit about that, like what you&#8217;re doing with that?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      I can&#8217;t give the names of the show, anything like that. So basically, I graduated from the Art Institute 2018, summer 2018, and I posted something on LinkedIn, I think it was an artwork and it went viral. And one of the recruiters from Nickelodeon hit me up as I was walking into Home Depot where I worked and offered me a freelance position on an upcoming show. So I took that and it&#8217;s been a blessing ever since, man. So I really just&#8230; whenever they need character design and stuff, they kind of just reach out. So it&#8217;s not like a guarantee, but when it&#8217;s here, it&#8217;s great. So I&#8217;m real grateful for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      And that came just from a LinkedIn post?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      LinkedIn, man, yeah. I love LinkedIn. Social media, in general, is great for me. As long as you run it as a business and professional, I think it&#8217;s the way to go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Okay. So with Nickelodeon kind of just contacting you when they need you, I&#8217;m pretty sure, because I&#8217;m curious about this too, what does character design look like for a studio like that? Talk to me about the workflow. What does that look like?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Absolutely. One thing that I do like about Nickelodeon, and I appreciate them coming to me, they like my art style and specifically, for the show that I&#8217;m working on, there are some African American cartoon characters. So that&#8217;s one thing that kind of makes me stand out, especially on LinkedIn. A lot of my followers and connections on LinkedIn like my art style. So that&#8217;s what Nickelodeon was looking forward to, and also Disney. So it&#8217;s pretty dope how they look for a specific style that would fit their certain cartoons, because a lot of these shows look the same, a lot of them shows use the same character design. And so I guess sometimes, you got to go out of the box and get different looks and styles. But what they do, they gave me a real slat image, real bland, real simple, almost like a children&#8217;s book for the artwork. It&#8217;s real simple. So they asked me to put my style onto this style that was already [inaudible 00:02:50] in the book, and that&#8217;s what I did, kind of just really hooked it up in my style. And they loved it.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      And when I went out there to Nickelodeon and when they took me on a tour and all of that, because I&#8217;m in Atlanta and Nickelodeon is way out there in Burbank, when I got out there, I was expecting to see my artwork on the wall. I would joke around with the whole team and just kind of laugh about how my artwork&#8217;s probably going to be on a wall with red X&#8217;s crossed through it, but they actually showed me a clip of the cartoon that they&#8217;re working on and developing and they made it and everything and it was my character. So it was so dope to see my actual character designs come to life like that. And it was in 3D too, so I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Man, you got to be kidding. This was [crosstalk 00:03:34].&#8221; So to see that, man, and like I said, I just graduated in 2018 and it&#8217;s just been a super dope ride, man, so far. So I&#8217;m real grateful for that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Wow. So that&#8217;s interesting that they start off with something simple, and then I guess you just have to redraw what they have or are you putting your own particular styles and things onto the images?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      No. No. So what it is, when I say I&#8217;m drawing, say, their character has a beard, he&#8217;s kind of buff and he&#8217;s wearing this outfit, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about. Now, I can draw whatever I want as long as he has the beard, this outfit, as long as they know it&#8217;s going to be this character, I can do whatever I want with it. So I&#8217;ll put them in a different pose and sometimes, they may want the character turn around, where you got to draw the front side, three quarter back. So it just depends. I&#8217;ve done a bunch of facial, different facial expressions and stuff like that. So it&#8217;s fun, man. I love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Yeah. So it sounds like it just varies pretty much based on what they have, what they need to get done.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Let&#8217;s switch gears here just a little bit. I do again want to go into talking about Team Supreme and especially about the Joshua Leonard Foundation. I&#8217;m curious to hear about that, we&#8217;ll talk about that later. But tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      I&#8217;m actually a military brat. So I was born in Miami and we left Miami after hurricane Andrew, went to Alaska. So I lived in Anchorage for a little bit, then we moved to Maryland. So I was in PG County for a little bit, then we went to Biloxi, Mississippi, where hurricane Katrina hit, so I got evacuated to Atlanta. So I kind of grew up everywhere, but born in Miami.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Okay.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      But, yeah. So now, residing in Atlanta until I have to go to LA to really start production on the shelf. So.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      When did you move from Miami?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Oh, man. Hmm.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Hurricane Andrew was like, what, &#8217;90&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      I think it was in &#8217;90&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      &#8217;92, &#8217;94? [crosstalk 00:05:30].</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      &#8217;92. I think it was &#8217;92. I&#8217;m not quite sure. I don&#8217;t really remember. I was a lot younger at the time, but I just remember riots. There was a lot of riots out there at the time. Yeah, it was rough. It was rough at the time in Miami.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      With all of this moving around because you&#8217;re, like you say, a military brat, moving from city to city like this, was creativity something that was a part of your childhood during this process?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Yeah, definitely. So I&#8217;m the baby out of two more older brothers and one of my older brothers, he taught me how to draw Garfield when I was really young, I think I was in kindergarten. And I&#8217;ve always, once I learned how to draw Garfield, I just never stopped, never stopped, always drawing in class, getting in trouble drawing and even moving around a lot. I just, I never stopped. I&#8217;m real good at sports. I got recruited in D1 Football, track scholarships, play baseball, basketball, but I never stopped drawing. I always had that kind of that thing to fall back on. Even though as a kid, I knew I would be an artist, but I thought I was going to be a professional athlete, which I could have, blew my knee out. So everything happens for a reason. I&#8217;m grateful for that. I&#8217;m doing what I&#8217;m supposed&#8230; I&#8217;m put here to make this cartoon and change these lives. So I&#8217;m real, I&#8217;m thankful for that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      What were some of your favorite animated shows and movies and stuff growing up?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Yeah. So I came from a strict background, obviously, military, but mother was real religious, so I wasn&#8217;t allowed to watch a lot of crazy stuff. So I grew up on Looney Tunes, Chuck Jones, some Disney, some Nickelodeon. I watched Doug, I&#8217;m a big Doug fan, but mainly Looney Tunes. Man, I love Chuck Jones. I love the style that they put in into the Looney Tunes characters. And that&#8217;s kind of what made me fall in love with animation, like the frame by frame animation, because I&#8217;m a traditional animator. I do the frame by frame stuff, which takes forever, but it looks the most beautiful. So.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      When you say frame by frame, what do you mean?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      That is drawing every single frame, right? If you pause a film and it&#8217;s just step by step by step by step, that means every single drawing. So if I&#8217;m drawing somebody waving, I have to draw every single drawing. Right now, you&#8217;re seeing a lot of puppet animation on TV where they can just move the hand and then do this and it doesn&#8217;t look as good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Hmm.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      [crosstalk 00:07:52] which shows are kind of puppet animation because they&#8217;re real stiff when they move. And then you can also tell when Disney does their frame by frame animation, Cinderella and all that stuff, Aladdin, that&#8217;s all frame by frame. It&#8217;s beautiful to look at.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Is the switch from frame by frame to puppet, is that just how the industry is going? Or is that because of technology?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Yeah, it&#8217;s both. It&#8217;s both.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Okay.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      So you have studios that is cheaper doing puppet animation. Because what you&#8217;re doing is basically 3D, except you&#8217;re doing a 2D character. So you have a&#8230; that&#8217;s where I would come in at, I would design a character, flat 2D character, and if somebody else would come in and rig it, and then rigging it is adding the bone structure inside it is, that way, they can move the puppet. You can grab this little elbow right here and make him raise his arm or make a wave or whatever it&#8217;s going to be, but, yeah. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a lot easier than drawing every single picture. You just draw one character and then you can move him around like a puppet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      But I like old school, frame by frame.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      I really, when I was growing up, I really like, I like Looney Tunes. I really like Tex Avery.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Tex [inaudible 00:09:02]. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, [crosstalk 00:09:04].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Yeah. The Tex Avery cartoons, the wolf and droopy dog. I love [crosstalk 00:09:08].</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. They had the good punch lines and yeah, they were definitely ahead at that time, Tom and Jerry, all of that stuff was really dope to me. So, [crosstalk 00:09:17].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      So because of that, I&#8217;m curious, how did that play a role in the development of your style of animation? You said it&#8217;s frame by frame, but did you get other influences from those series?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      I mean, frame by frame animation is frame by frame animation. It&#8217;s really, if you have to draw every single movement, you&#8217;re getting, you grab them from everywhere. But definitely, Chuck Jones, Disney, obviously, Fleischer brothers, Tex Avery, so yeah, I studied all of that stuff and it&#8217;s so many more. Aaron Blaise, he did a lot of stuff. I think he did the character design for the Beast in Beauty and the Beast, animated the Beast, so a lot of other animators that I studied, the cartoons that I watched and learned from. But yeah, definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      So your brother teaches you how to draw Garfield, right? So he shows you this one character. When did you I guess first know that you are good at art, period? When did you first [inaudible 00:10:16], &#8220;Oh wait, I could do this, not just as the one thing that my brother taught me.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      I think that&#8217;s about when, because I was real young. I mean, we&#8217;re talking about kindergarten. So I don&#8217;t know if I was five, I don&#8217;t remember how young I was, but once I drew that, I mean, it was just a straight headshot of Garfield and it&#8217;s easy to do. So ever since then, I&#8217;ve always taken an art class or some type of, anything dealing with art, I was taking it, but elementary school, middle school, high school, always to the art class and always aced the art classes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      So you&#8217;re in Miami, you&#8217;re moving again between all these different cities, you&#8217;ve got this passion for art and animation, when did you I guess really decide you would pursue it? Because-</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      &#8230; if you mentioned earlier that you wanted to be an athlete-</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      &#8230; you got drafted D1, where was the split there between athletics and animation?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Absolutely. So like I said, I was always&#8230; I come from an athletic background and so I think around probably high school, maybe 9th, 10th grade, I was getting a lot better at art. I was still trash, but I got a lot better. But I was still an athlete and I was still getting recruited and all of that, but it was a fallback thing. I knew I would go pro or do something like that, but at the same time, even me being a pro, I was going to still open up an animation studio or something like that. Probably high school while I can definitely learn a little bit more. But also, living in Biloxi, Mississippi, there&#8217;s not much to do out there. They got the military base. I actually started off as a graphic designer because there&#8217;s no animation in Mississippi. So that was kind of a hinder for me and I didn&#8217;t like that, but I do love graphic design as well, not as much as animation, obviously, but I do, I still love fonts and character fonts and all of that type of stuff and motion graphics and regular graphics.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      But when I came to Atlanta, that&#8217;s when it really got like, okay, this is why I&#8217;m here. This is what it&#8217;s going to be. This is what I&#8217;m supposed to be doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Yeah. And you said that happened as a consequence of hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Right. So what happened was 2005, I think, hurricane Katrina came.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Yeah, 2005. So I got evacuated here. My daughter was also born during hurricane Katrina, so Katrina hit [crosstalk 00:00:12:35]-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Wow.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      &#8230; August 29th, my daughter was born September 6th. So I was homeless. Yeah, I lived right on the beach. I was going to William Carey College in Biloxi Gulfport, and when I came back, it was nothing there, man. It was a slab. It was crazy, man. All those big mansions on the water, they were gone. They were gone. Have you big old 20 foot deep holes. And I mean, crazy, crazy, looked like the end of the world. But like I said, everything happens for a reason. So as bad as it was, I&#8217;m grateful for it. I mean, it was bad, like a movie almost. You couldn&#8217;t get water. You can only pump a certain amount of gas. I mean, it was a lot of people going crazy out there. But talking about bathing and the same bathwater as everybody else in that house with, I mean, it was rough, man. [crosstalk 00:13:25].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Wow.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      So I got evacuated to Atlanta, daughter was born and I kind of just followed her and her mother back to Biloxi to kind of help them out. And now she&#8217;s here. So I came back and I&#8217;ve been here since 2014. Been the best, best thing ever. Ever since I moved to Atlanta in 2014, Atlanta has been so good to me. It&#8217;s been really, really a great move for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Oh, that&#8217;s good. That&#8217;s good. So before that move though, between you sort of getting to Atlanta, had your daughter, then you went back to Biloxi, were you still working on animation during that time there or were you just focused on getting back to Atlanta?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      No. At that time I was just, I think I was just working.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      So I started working at Home Depot. Yeah, the animation really started when I was in Atlanta. When I came, when I got evacuated here, I started to go to the Art Institute to see if I can get in. I didn&#8217;t get in, in 2005 during hurricane Katrina. But I was just glad, because I had too much debt, that&#8217;s the reason why, I had too much debt at the time. But just, when I came to Atlanta, then know they had a SCAD out here and art institute and all these animation studios, I was like, man, this is perfect. But I said, man, I&#8217;m going to do what I love to do and that way, I don&#8217;t ever have to retire. And that&#8217;s why I stayed with it and I don&#8217;t have to get&#8230; I don&#8217;t have to tackle these big old 230 pounds running backs anymore and get hit by big linebackers anymore. I can stay healthy and just draw, man. So, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      What was your time like at the Art Institute of Atlanta?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      It was good for me. It was good for me. And a lot of people, they have different, you read a lot of bad stuff and you read some good stuff. I think it depends on the person. I remember, man, when I went 2014, shout out to Mr. Myvett who was my president of that school at the time, he told me, kind of pulled me to the side, because I was on President&#8217;s List the whole four years I was there. I graduated with a 4.0 top of the class, I was the commencement speaker, me and Rep. John Lewis. We spoke, but I remember Mr. Myvett kind of pulled me to the side, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Man, look, this school, you have to brand yourself. That&#8217;s what this school is good for. You got to brand yourself.&#8221; But I took that to heart and that&#8217;s what I did.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      I remember, I would go to class with sweatpants on and an Under Armour shirt, but I sat in the front, right up front, passed everything, straight As. And the more I did it every quarter, the teachers are like, okay, [inaudible 00:15:52], I got the tight shirts on with the muscles, okay, get straight As. He&#8217;s not playing around.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      And I kind of let my teachers know, I was one of the oldest one who was in there anyway. And I remember talking to kind of my younger peers who weren&#8217;t really getting that work done, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Man, you don&#8217;t even have to work after this. You just go home and play video games. Why aren&#8217;t these projects done?&#8221; I got to go home. I mean, I get off out of class, man, I worked full-time jobs. So I get up at 3:00 in the morning.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      And then I have all my stuff done and everything like that. So I&#8217;m trying to tell him, &#8220;Man, this school costs way too much money for you all to be playing around.&#8221; So I kind of went in there with the mindset, I&#8217;m out to kill all the competition I can up here while I&#8217;m here and everybody will know that I went to this school and that I did well at this school. And I loved it, man. I would tell my teachers, &#8220;Look, you might not be able to tell this person that their work is trash, but you can tell me. You got to be honest with me. This is going to make me [crosstalk 00:16:47].&#8221; So some kids didn&#8217;t like that. Teachers would get in trouble because they were too honest to the kids. I&#8217;m 100% with that. You got to&#8230; truth hurts, but you got to, if it&#8217;s trash, you let me know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      And they will let me know. I feel like this could be better. I said, &#8220;Okay, no problem. I&#8217;ll go back and change it. Let&#8217;s make it better.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      So once you graduated, do you feel like the Art Institute kind of prepared you for the animation industry? Did they sort of get you ready for the next step of life?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Yeah, absolutely. Because even as a freshman, I was already doing work for big time animators. I wasn&#8217;t getting paid, but I worked on a short film called Mila, which is not out yet, but what I did, and people, especially younger kids, I guess they think I&#8217;m joking on, I mean, LinkedIn and stuff like that, social media, all I simply did, I remember seeing a post on it on Twitter. It&#8217;s a short film, shout out to [inaudible 00:17:46], she&#8217;s the one that&#8217;s producing it and she worked at Dreamworks. So now, she&#8217;s over [inaudible 00:17:52] up in Canada, so big time animator that kind of mentored me that I met on social media, and all I did was send a message. I said, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m a&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      And all I did was send a message. I said, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m a freshman at the Art Institute&#8230; I love to help out any way I can.&#8221; Boom. And they wrote me back, &#8220;Hey, okay, well this is a kind of a free opportunity when I&#8230; This is just people that want to help out.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, yeah man, absolutely. This is how I&#8217;m going to learn. These are industry people and that&#8217;s what I did and it&#8217;s been the best relationship even to this day. So matter of fact, if it wasn&#8217;t for [inaudible 0:00:00:27], she&#8217;s the one that helped me with my resume and because I had, my website was pure animation. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Nah, take that off, you&#8217;re a character designer. That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re going to be known as a character designer. That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re the best at. Take the animation off, do this stuff.&#8221; My animation won best of show and all of that. You&#8217;re a character designer, trust, me, you do this. And once I changed all this stuff, that&#8217;s when Nickelodeon hit me up. So I was like, maybe [inaudible 00:18:51].</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Super dope, man. But yeah, I feel like Art Institute really helped me out. Me, specifically, like I said, the teachers were a 100% honest with me. So that&#8217;s what I was really grateful for. You have some teachers say, &#8220;Man, you can&#8217;t graduate from here and then get a character design guy.&#8221; I did, but I don&#8217;t think he was talking to me specifically because like I said, I went in there to kill all the competition. I wanted to really, I wanted them to know who I was. And anything I could do, I was asking questions. Anything, I can do this. It was too much money. You spending all that money, you better get as much as you can out of it. Ask everything you can, learn as much as you can. That&#8217;s what I did. But yeah, I felt like they really helped me out a lot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      And I mean it sounds like you had a mission though also going-</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      I did.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      &#8230; into school-</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Yeah, I did.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Just to kind of give you just a little bit of background. So I&#8217;m in Atlanta too. I don&#8217;t know if I mentioned that or if I said that earlier-</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      No, I didn&#8217;t know that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      I&#8217;ve done some advising at the Art Institute of Atlanta. So they have this thing called the&#8230; What&#8217;s it called? The Professional Advancement Group or something like that. It&#8217;s something where basically the faculty at the Art Institute of Atlanta, they talk to designers and folks in the industry that are in Atlanta and they sort of like talk to them to get a sense of what are the things that we should be teaching students. The industry is changing a lot. And so schools can often be very lax at keeping up with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      And so they&#8217;ll ask us, &#8220;Well, what are the things that you&#8217;re looking for when you&#8217;re trying to hire? What are the skills that you want to see in? If it&#8217;s the web, of course the big thing is UX and product design or something like that. And there are people that come through that are traditional like visual designers, graphic designers, and the conversation tends to get more about, at least from what I&#8217;ve seen when I&#8217;ve went to talk to them, the conversation ends up devolving into just like nostalgia about their time there. Or it&#8217;s teachers complaining that the students don&#8217;t have enough initiative to do more things. And I&#8217;ll tell this to students too, when you&#8217;re putting your portfolio together, for example, depending on the position that you&#8217;re looking for, you have to be able to tell a story.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      You have to be able to show your thoughts behind why you&#8217;ve done certain things, what the certain decisions are that you&#8217;ve made in particular designs that you&#8217;ve done. Because otherwise it&#8217;s just a picture book. And anybody can take, like there&#8217;re all kinds of mock-up things that you can get on the web for free or for cheap. And you can just throw your logo in there and it makes it look like you did a professionally shot campaign or something. And that&#8217;s not the case. What was the rationale behind that? Why did you make these decisions? Did you talk with the client? Did this serve the business goals? And I mean that&#8217;s of course if that&#8217;s what you want to do with design, but it&#8217;s sort of boiled down to making sure that students go into school having that initiative that they need to get something out of this experience other than just a degree. And it sounds like for you, you went into it with a plan, pretty much.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Yeah. And I feel like that&#8217;s, you had to, you had to, man. Because I mean that&#8217;s the mentality I had. I want to learn as much as I can, I&#8217;m spending this much money, I&#8217;m going to use every outlet I can. And I did work. I mean this was as a freshman man, I was doing work for NFL players, logos, anything that I could put on my resume as a freshman. I had business cards already. I wasn&#8217;t playing around man, I really wanted to brand myself at the school. And then once the school started noticing, they started getting behind me. Like, this interviews. I was getting interviews and they would put me on stuff and I mean just everything. Plugging me in certain things and it was really good for me, really good for me. So I&#8217;m real thankful for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Nice. And so you&#8217;re here in Atlanta, a lot of the big animation studios are out on the West coast. You kind of alluded there a little bit about having to move from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Is that happening in the near future?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      So here&#8217;s what it&#8217;s going to be. People that don&#8217;t know the animation industry is less than 3% black in it. It&#8217;s really bad. The diverse is getting better, but it&#8217;s still really bad. I have Leonard Studios here, I have an LLC right now. So after I go out to LA for Team Supreme and we start production, I might have to stay out there for like two, three years. I&#8217;m coming back to Atlanta. I&#8217;m building a studio out here. I&#8217;m doing my Tyler Perry thing out here. I want a big facility, animation. I mean a real, real, that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m going to be investing my money in. I&#8217;m already looking at buildings and land and that was my thing like. And the crazy thing about Atlanta and LA, LA shows me a lot of love as far as jobs and stuff. Like I said, Disney had me out there, gave me the tour.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      I was going to be a character designer for Devil Dinosaur and Moon Girl on Marvel, but they went another direction, which is, that&#8217;s perfectly fine. I&#8217;m thankful that I got the opportunity to go out there. They gave me a tour, I got to meet everybody. Just for them to consider me. That was major, stuff like that. I did the special Olympics. Special Olympics flew me out to LA and I was in a high rise all the way at the top in a suite and I did an interview live with all these celebrities. Kobe Bryant&#8217;s sister was there with her daughter. I think she&#8217;s a chef or something like that. But I mean like LA showed me a lot of love. I can&#8217;t get a job out here in Atlanta at an animation studio.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Really?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      [crosstalk 00:24:29] It&#8217;s crazy man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Wait, wait, wait, let&#8217;s talk about that actually because&#8230; So I&#8217;ve done, for folks that have listened to the show for a while, they know that, well, one thing that I try to do is I always try to talk to folks here in the city because Atlanta is this weird outlier in the-</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      It is, it is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      &#8230; creative industry and that for design animation certainly there&#8217;s something about Atlanta and the city and the culture that breeds this immense amount of creativity in a lot of different fields. In music, art, fashion, film, TV, et cetera. And there are certain industries that have taken advantage of that. Most notably probably television and film, but then like Zine or even like what you&#8217;re talking about with animation, it&#8217;s still something where you have to go to like New York or LA or somewhere else to get the opportunities and they&#8217;re not here. Which you would think Atlanta has Cartoon Network and Adult Swim. You would think, well I mean, that&#8217;s one company, but. I didn&#8217;t know that it was that&#8230; Is it bad? Is it really bad out here for animation?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Did you know a lot of people don&#8217;t know this, there&#8217;s over 90 animation studios in Georgia.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Wow.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      In Atlanta. Yeah. Yep.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Wow.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      And I&#8217;m a part of a group called [inaudible 00:07:47]. So it was a lot of SCAD members and that&#8217;s the thing. I think that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t really get looked at out here like that because I didn&#8217;t go to SCAD. I almost did. I&#8217;m like, Art Institute, way cheaper. I&#8217;m going to have to go here instead and we had SCAD teachers and all that. I know everybody over there at SCAD and, but yeah, and that&#8217;s, it&#8217;s crazy because you see a lot of SCAD people at these companies, Turner and Cartoon Network. And so I think it is, I&#8217;m still black for one. The animation industry is still going to be extremely hard for me to get in and I get that.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      But at the same time I have no problem with somebody who&#8217;s better than me. I will, 100%. You know what? You&#8217;re right. That was the right move. You&#8217;ve got a good dude right there. He&#8217;s better. [inaudible 00:26:31] But-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Do you think-</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      &#8230; and that&#8217;s how I have a chip on my shoulder right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      You do?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      I feel, oh yeah, absolutely, absolutely. And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m building this studio. That&#8217;s where the whole Tyler Perry mentality came from. Like you know what? Man, if I can&#8217;t get hired, these other companies is going to have to&#8230; We&#8217;re going to have to battle. We&#8217;re going to have to battle and my cartoons are going to be better. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s kind of frustrating. I&#8217;m like man, with Team Supreme, not one studio in Atlanta? I would be jumping on this. But do you know what studios come? LA, Canada, all the other ones.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Yeah. There&#8217;s big animation in Canada. [inaudible 00:27:08].</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Oh, Canada&#8217;s huge, Absolutely, yeah, they&#8217;re huge. And then Toon Boom, is a shout out to Toon Boom. They sponsor me. So I get software from them. But yeah, I mean it&#8217;s crazy. Atlanta has been great to me. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love it. I love, I&#8217;m real grateful for all my connects out here. Because I know a lot of people in the industry, especially the music industry, but the animation part of it is still kind of tricky. Still, kind of tricky. I&#8217;m like, man, look, I will be a janitor at Cartoon Network or Bento Box. Just get me in the door. I&#8217;ll leave artwork all over the place so they will be like, &#8220;Man, who does this?&#8221; I&#8217;ll make myself known. It&#8217;s, you can even get in. But then I got, I know people that just graduated that got hired at Bento Box this year. It&#8217;s like eh, it&#8217;s kind of frustrating. But at the same time I&#8217;m very patient. I know I have a good brand on my hands so I just stay with it, man. Just stay with the [inaudible 00:28:01].</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Do you think, because we&#8217;ve got an Art Institute and there&#8217;re other schools that have design programs and such. Do you think there&#8217;s maybe too much talent here and not enough work? Well clearly, There&#8217;s not enough work is what you just said, but. Do you think there&#8217;s too much talent here?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      No, I don&#8217;t think, I mean I think it&#8217;s a lot of talent, but I just think that&#8230; Here&#8217;s the thing. So my portfolio day, we didn&#8217;t have any studios come out to our portfolio day. I&#8217;ll be honest with you. None of them came. But-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      And what year was this?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      This is 2018 and I&#8217;m not mad at that because if the seniors are not putting out work that&#8217;s good enough, like the years before. Why would you waste the time? So I did my due diligence on my own. Like I said, I branded myself. I was like, look man, here&#8217;s my portfolio. Boom. As a, I think I was a junior, I got paid $6,000 to do a 32-second commercial for a client. This is, I mean I&#8217;m still in school and working full-time and running Leonard Studios, LLC with the NFL players doing this stuff and I was the best thing.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      And that&#8217;s just from social media. Me, posting artwork, $6,000 man, it&#8217;s easy. It took a while because I did&#8230; It was frame by frame animation. But I mean it is a lot of talent here. I still think it&#8217;s kind of cliqued up. I still think it&#8217;s kind of cliqued up with the whole SCAD and artists 2 thing. I do think it&#8217;s two different monsters and that&#8217;s fine. That&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;m all about being fair but I do believe certain studios will look out for their friends and their guys. That&#8217;s unfortunate, but it&#8217;s life, man.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Well, I mean that same thing happens too, unfortunately in the design industry, that whole pipeline, companies and schools and like if you didn&#8217;t go to that school then you don&#8217;t get in. I&#8217;ve been in the design industry for a long time and I didn&#8217;t go to design school. I went to Morehouse here in Atlanta, majored in math, like I have no formal design background at all. Everything has been self-taught. And luckily the design industry is lenient in that way and that you can make a living without having actually gotten a degree of some sort in the field. But there are opportunities, I know that I&#8217;ve been shut out from because I didn&#8217;t go to design school and I&#8217;ve heard it explicitly. I&#8217;ll give you another example. I went to, not I went to, I had a job at AT&#038;T, this was in 2000. Actually this might&#8217;ve been about the time you first came to Atlanta, this was in 2006. And I got a job at and AT&#038;T in Midtown at the big tall AT&#038;T tower.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      And everybody that was on the design team went to Art Institute of Atlanta. They were graduates, friends, et cetera. And I was the only one there that did not go to Art Institute. And I remember that first day, I&#8217;m like doing a tour and everyone&#8217;s, &#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s your name? Blah, blah, blah. Did you go to Art Institute?&#8221; That was the first question, not where did you go to school? Or when did you graduate from Art Institute? I said, &#8220;No, no, no. I went to Morehouse College.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, where&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      I mean, well, like if you look out the window.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Right, it&#8217;s right there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      You see that green roof way off in the distance? That&#8217;s Morehouse. It&#8217;s here. So I get that. I totally understand that thing. But wow, I didn&#8217;t know it was still so pervasive. That sucks.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      It&#8217;s tough, man. And you know it was crazy. I got a couple friends that work at the CNN Center, so I got a good buddy of mine that he&#8217;s up there and he always sends me stuff. He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Man, you can do this way better.&#8221; Yeah, I could. And he like, &#8220;Man, look, send me your resume. I&#8217;m going to do this, Boom. I&#8217;m going to drop it off.&#8221; And we&#8217;ve done that like three times. Nothing. The one thing I do think I&#8217;m put here, actually, I know I&#8217;m putting it to create this cartoon and do this Team Supreme stuff.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      And I believe that&#8217;s why I keep getting shut out as far as Atlanta goes with animation [inaudible 00:13:50]. So it kind of gives me a little more motivation to just strictly grind on Team Supreme. Like I said, we got the book coming with some crazy technology attached to that. Just came from the Children&#8217;s Hospital of Atlanta yesterday. So we&#8217;ve got big partnership with them. I went and spoke at Novartis, which is a big pharmaceutical company in New Jersey, so they pay me, I went out there to speak at the disability mentoring day, had a blast. So it&#8217;s a lot of outside stuff that I get more&#8230; I like a lot more anyway, as it pertains to Team Supreme, it&#8217;s starting to really move.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Let&#8217;s talk about Team Supreme then. Because for folks that may not know or may not have heard of Team Supreme, can you just tell us a little bit about what it is?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Yeah, so Team Supreme is a cartoon that I&#8217;m creating about a group of kids who have a disability, but the disability is their superpower. So imagine a Marvel, but all of the characters are inclusive. So I have a character that has spina bifida. I have an amputee, I have a deaf character, my main character has autism. I have a deaf character, blind, sickle cell. So basically I wanted to create a whole universe of these inclusive characters, every type of disability, diabetes, anything and all these character would be the forefront instead of kind of hidden in the background, so. And that&#8217;s kind of where Team Supreme came from. I was like, man, you know what, for me being a person of color and growing up you didn&#8217;t see a lot of characters that look like us. I&#8217;m like, man, not only am I going to make a character that looks like me, I&#8217;m going to give him a disability and make this age a cartoon about disability and special needs.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Because I know everybody in the world knows somebody or has a family member. This will be so big that it will touch so many souls. And not only just motivate kids, but it&#8217;ll help the parents. And so that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about. So I&#8217;m actually still developing it. I have Lena Waithe and Hillman Grad on board as producers and-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Nice.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      &#8230; and Jason Weaver. So everybody knows Jason Weaver from Lion King. He plays Simba, he&#8217;s in ATL, big mentor of mine, great friend, shout out Jason Weaver. Shout out Lena and Richie. I have a writer that writes for the show Quantico. So shout out to Jazelle and she&#8217;s actually partially deaf. So super dope and I&#8217;m super excited about the next steps, which is us pitching to a bunch of studios, Disney, Nickelodeon, Netflix. So we moving forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Nice. When I told people that I was interviewing you, the main question they asked me is, &#8220;when is Team Supreme coming out? When is it getting animated? When is it coming out?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Can you tell folks about the development cycle when it comes to animated works?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Yes, I can. That&#8217;s a great question because it gets frustrating and I get it. Because this is, man I think I started touching on Team Supreme around 2014, kind of teased it and it went viral. Even that next year, they like, &#8220;When is it going to be available? When is it going to be out?&#8221; And I remember I was in two car accidents back to back days when I was at the Art Institute. The first one I was at a red light in a car, just totaled my car in the back. Had to stop. So I had to get five epidurals. So as I&#8217;m home I had my Cintiq on the bed and I&#8217;m drawing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      So what I did, I animated a little one-minute clip. This is old, old and that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re seeing in the little preview and that&#8217;s why all the characters look totally different. Because I was still developing, I&#8217;ve learned some stuff. I was still learning how to animate so I was playing around with it. So the development process is long in itself. That can take a year or two. And then you&#8217;re talking about a cartoon like mine that&#8217;s so important and serious that you don&#8217;t want to step on any toes. My cartoons taking longer to make and create and develop because I have to make sure everything is 100% true to life. And it&#8217;s correct. The words that we use are true and the proper.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Correct. The words that we use are true, and the proper words. We have to consult with people that have a disability, and specific disabilities to our characters. That&#8217;s another thing, so you&#8217;re talking to doctors and nurses and medical field industry people. It&#8217;s a lot of studying and stuff like that. Then you have to get the cartoon picked up, and that can take another year, or another two years just doing the contract, going back and forth with contracts and stuff, so it&#8217;s a lot. But my team is really excited about the next step, which is the pitching part of the process. We&#8217;re really close. Yeah, we&#8217;re really close to getting it picked up, and I&#8217;m really excited about it. Yeah, it&#8217;s a long process. It&#8217;s a long process, but I think for this show people will appreciate the length of this process, and see how important it is, because we don&#8217;t get everything right. So yeah, I&#8217;m really excited about it, but I apologize for the wait. Just bear with me if you can.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      I didn&#8217;t know UPS was going to be coming this late. I&#8217;ve been waiting around all day for them.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      What was the last thing you were saying just now?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      I was saying that I just apologize for the wait, but with a cartoon like mine, everything has to be 100% correct, and I want to make sure it&#8217;s done right. I was saying how I think people will appreciate that we took this extra time to really consult with all of these different people. Disabilities are not just &#8230; Just making sure we&#8217;re getting everything right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      It&#8217;s interesting you mentioned that it&#8217;s changed over time. Is that a worry when it comes to the development process, that you started out with things looking one way, and then maybe your personal style changed over the years bit by bit?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Yeah. What happens is, I&#8217;m not worried. That&#8217;s just the development stage. You start off with some trash character designs, and I have a ton. Once I put out the Team Supreme, the art of Team Supreme, you&#8217;ll see all these bad designs, and these bad character models. The original, I had these kids, they were super young, kindergarten young, real cute, and big heads. But as I kept getting better with the drawing, more anatomy and stuff like that because I studied some more stuff, I started to get better, and just found my style that I really wanted to stick with, with this thing.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      One thing I was tired of seeing was the same look for cartoons, and they kind of joke around. I forgot what they call it, the [cow arts 00:02:30]? Just straight arms, the hands, real simple, but I get it. Kids don&#8217;t care as long as the writing is dope, and it&#8217;s colorful and fun. I get it, but hopefully we won&#8217;t have to do that for this one, because my characters, they&#8217;ve got meat on their bones, the fingers and the joints and all of that. But yeah, where I have the characters at now is where I&#8217;m happy.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Got you. As folks who know, who have listened to this show for a while, I&#8217;ve personally had my own, I guess you could say, graphic novel idea that I&#8217;ve had for a long time. I&#8217;ve been like oh, I really need to find an illustrator to collaborate with, because I want to write the characters. I&#8217;ve come up with the characters, whether it&#8217;s just a matter of oh, well who do I find that can do the designs or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      When it comes to that kind of process, because you&#8217;re the artist, how long did it take you to find a writer, to be able to get everything together with Team Supreme?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Well, I&#8217;ve already &#8230; A lot of this stuff was done by me in the beginning. We had a whole &#8230; Team Supreme was supposed to be a short film. I was going to do a short film, and that&#8217;s why I was trying to raise the money so I wouldn&#8217;t have to work for a year. I was just going to animate the whole show for eight minutes by myself, backgrounds, everything, storyboard. I was going to do it all by myself. I didn&#8217;t raise enough money with the Indiegogo campaign. I think I ended up raising $6,000, which I&#8217;m super thankful for. I&#8217;m real grateful for that, but we had to go a different route. That&#8217;s kind of where we&#8217;re at right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Yeah. Just so folks know, the animation, all of that, it takes time.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      It&#8217;s not as simple as &#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t say as simple as one might think. I don&#8217;t know how simple they think it might be, but I guess maybe because we see so much animation now these days, I feel like we see much more animation now than we did when we were kids, between television and especially now with feature films and stuff. Animation is big now.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      It&#8217;s big right now. Yes, absolutely. Yeah, so frame by frame animation is what I was going to do. That commercial I was telling you about, the 30 second commercial? Just for 30 seconds it took me three months, but that&#8217;s me still working full time and going to school, just doing it whenever I could, after a weekend or so like that, but that was the whole process. I had to do tons of character design, I had to do character turnarounds. When you&#8217;re talking about a book or something like that, it&#8217;s still difficult to do. Then a lot of people don&#8217;t realize how expensive this stuff can get. Some people charge by the hour. Some people charge like, &#8220;Hey, do you want this? This is going to be a flat rate, $1,200,&#8221; or whatever they charge. I don&#8217;t know. I think as somebody &#8230; If you have your book, as long as everything is in detail you&#8217;ll save a lot of money, because you&#8217;re going to save the artist some time. I get a lot of people, &#8220;I need a logo.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      &#8220;Well, what do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      &#8220;Man, I&#8217;m not even sure.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re going to spend extra money, because I&#8217;m going to have to do extra designs for you.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      What I usually do, I sketch something out. I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s stick figures. Sketch something out just so I&#8217;ll know where&#8217;s that in your mind, and then I&#8217;ll work around that. I&#8217;ll hook it up for you. That usually saves them a little bit of time. But as far as book illustration, I&#8217;ve never done one for a client, just because I don&#8217;t know &#8230; If it&#8217;s a serious client and they really understand the process, how the money and stuff works, and time and all of that, then I may think about it. But most of them want 34 pages for $500, which is not &#8230; The work is not worth the time I put into it, because it is a lot. You&#8217;re talking about backgrounds and painting and coloring, and character designers could add as well, so it just depends on the artist, I think.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Nice. Okay. Let&#8217;s kind of switch gears a little bit. We&#8217;ve talked a lot about Team Supreme. We&#8217;ve talked a lot about just your story in general. I&#8217;m curious to know at this point where you&#8217;re at right now? Are you satisfied creatively?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      I am, yeah. I&#8217;m very satisfied. For me, like I said, just being out of school for two years, I&#8217;ve done probably more than a lot of people. I&#8217;m so grateful for that, because I know if I was in Biloxi I wouldn&#8217;t &#8230; Team Supreme still probably would have popped off, but I don&#8217;t even know if I would have made it happen if I was out there. You know what I mean? So where I&#8217;m at right now, I&#8217;m really grateful, man. It&#8217;s pretty dope. I have a lot of celebrity support behind it, so yeah, I&#8217;m very happy where I&#8217;m at.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      What keeps you motivated and inspired these days?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Definitely my daughter keeps me motivated. Other artists keep me inspired. Seeing these kids, especially yesterday at Children&#8217;s Hospital, stuff like that is dope to me, man. I did not even want to leave. I met a little kid up there. Little kid had his fire red hair and he had fibrosis, I think he had. He came up with these little characters. He was telling me, &#8220;Yeah, I come up with these ideas for villains and good guys and bad guys.&#8221; I mean, really young kid, man. He might have been seven, and just his imagination was so dope. As they&#8217;re taking me on a tour of these places, they showed me this other little kid that drew two different pictures. One was him as a regular kid, and he has sickle cell, little [inaudible 00:43:47] kid. Then on the other side, it was him as a superhero. I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s what Team Supreme is, man. That&#8217;s exactly why I&#8217;m doing this, because you guys do have super powers.&#8221; Seeing stuff like that, super inspiring, super motivational.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Even when I&#8217;ve seen &#8230; If you guys are not familiar with Shaquem Griffin, he&#8217;s the one went to, I think &#8230; I know he&#8217;s from Florida, but he&#8217;s an amputee. He&#8217;s a linebacker, and he plays ball with half an arm. I remember he was in the combine, and they really doubted him. He wasn&#8217;t that good, and this and that. Then this dude ran a 4 340 at 230 pounds was unbelievable to me. To see that with just one arm, how in the world? 4 340, that&#8217;s Olympic speed, and if you&#8217;re 230 pounds running that fast? Super power, you know? Stuff like that, man, is really motivational to me, and very inspiring.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      I&#8217;ve seen a dude doing climbing a rock wall attached to his wheelchair. He had his seatbelt on the wheelchair, and he pulled the whole thing up on the rock wall.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Wow.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Man, crazy, crazy stuff. I&#8217;m thinking in my mind, why hasn&#8217;t anybody done anything like this? My thing is, I think it was out of fear. &#8220;Oh, I [inaudible 00:45:03]. If I don&#8217;t do it right, they&#8217;re going to rip you apart.&#8221; But that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here, man. This is my project. I&#8217;m going to make it happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Where do you think your life would&#8217;ve gone if you weren&#8217;t doing animation?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Is that if my knee wasn&#8217;t messed up?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Well, yeah. So you&#8217;d have stayed and been an athlete then basically?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Yeah. I definitely would have played pro baseball and pro football, for sure. Like I said, my whole family is very athletic. My dad was a top running back coming out of Texas, blew his knee out. I&#8217;ve got a cousin Ray Butler that played for the Colts. Ike Forte, my uncle, he played for the Redskins and the Patriots. I&#8217;ve got a couple of cousins at Southern Miss right now. I&#8217;ve got one in high school that just graduated. One thinks he&#8217;s going to be going pro. He&#8217;s 6&#8242; 4&#8243;, 350. Athletes are here, so yeah, I would definitely be a professional athlete somewhere.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Oh, then in 2005 Hurricane Katrina came, but I was training as a boxer for the 2008 Olympics. But Hurricane Katrina messed me up, so I had to get evacuated out here and all this stuff, so it was a mess.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      In 2008 my best friend got murdered, so it really &#8230; That&#8217;s more motivation and more &#8230; Yeah, he was robbed and murdered in 2008, so that really motivated me and kind of inspired me to keep going. Matter of fact, Brent is the main character. He&#8217;s the dad in my cartoon. That&#8217;s that big dude you see.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Everybody thinks that&#8217;s me. That&#8217;s not me. That&#8217;s my best friend. That&#8217;s me keeping Brent Jackson&#8217;s name alive. Good dude. He had a great heart, and he was real [inaudible 00:46:35], big dude, man, so that&#8217;s just me keeping him alive, and that&#8217;s how he was. He loved people, loved kids, but that&#8217;s where I get all my inspiration from, and motivation.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      What advice has stuck with you the longest? It can be life advice, career advice, anything like that.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Life advice? Always stay humble. That&#8217;s from my dad, and he&#8217;s a big inspiration to me. Grew up poor in Texas, retired in the Air Force as a chief. He&#8217;s got three master&#8217;s degrees, a bachelor degree. He always gives me just life tips, right? &#8220;Hey, whenever you make it to the top, don&#8217;t forget to send the elevator back down,&#8221; stuff like that, so it stays with me.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Let&#8217;s see. Career advice? Yeah, definitely just staying humble. You&#8217;ve got to &#8230; I was told animation studios and the industry doesn&#8217;t like those real shy people, especially an animation studio. They want to have fun in there. What I remember going to Nickelodeon, the first thing I noticed, everything was bright, colorful. Everybody was smiling. It was amazing to me. Then I went to Disney and they had puppies in each &#8230; People could bring their dogs to work and stuff like that. They want people with these personalities that fit. But man, I&#8217;ve gotten so many good career advices. Wow, that&#8217;s tough right off the top, man. That&#8217;s tough. I&#8217;d have to think about it a little bit more, but I&#8217;ve heard. That&#8217;s a good one. That&#8217;s a great question.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Where do you see yourself in the next five years? I know Team Supreme is still in production right now, but we&#8217;re in the future now. It&#8217;s 2020. Come 2025-</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Billionaire.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Okay. What is Joshua Leonard working on? What&#8217;s he doing? He&#8217;s a billionaire?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      No, I say that to say this. Money comes and goes. I&#8217;ve never really been &#8230; You obviously have to have money to survive, but like I said, that&#8217;s where being homeless comes in at. I appreciate the little things, so money, with $1 billion I&#8217;m all about helping people. That&#8217;s where the foundation and stuff come in at. The money&#8217;s going to come, especially with Team Supreme and what I do, speaking to students and kids and all of that stuff. I&#8217;m going to create the [steam 00:48:50] program. We do the field trips, I want scholarships, all of that type of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      But yeah, five years from now Team Supreme is probably going to be starting to work on a live action. It&#8217;s going to be major, man. This is a major project, and it&#8217;s limitless, really. It really is. But I just see Team Supreme really taking off real heavy, a worldwide household name. I mean worldwide. I get emails from Africa, Australia. There&#8217;s people thanking me for creating this for their son or their relative that has any type of disability, so super dope. I&#8217;m really excited about the next five years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Nice. Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you and your work, and everything online?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      My website where they can find all the Team Supreme stuff is leonardstudios.com. That&#8217;s L-E-O-N-A-R-D, studios, S-T-U-D-I-O-S, dot com. Then social media is, ImJoshuaLeonard, and it&#8217;s just I-M-J-O-S-H-U-A-L-E-O- N-A-R-D. There&#8217;s two Joshua Leonards out there. There&#8217;s the one that &#8230; There&#8217;s the white guy that did the Blair Witch Project, so that&#8217;s not me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      Okay.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      A lot of people-</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      This is on Twitter or Instagram?</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      This is on all levels. Yeah, it&#8217;s the same. As a matter of fact, if you add the &#8230; If you add that on Instagram, my Instagram has all of my sites on it, so you&#8217;ll be able to find the Team Supreme page, the Leonard Studios page, all of it, the website, email, anything.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      I also mentor kids or anybody. If you&#8217;ve got questions and stuff, I&#8217;ve got the email on there. I&#8217;m always open to give back and help people, so that&#8217;s about it, man. My main picture is me in a suit. I love wearing tailored suits, so you&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry</b>:      All right, sounds good. Well, Joshua Leonard, I want to thank you just so much for coming on the show. One, for sharing your story. I had heard about Team Supreme a while ago, and I had seen the viral clips and everything. I was like, &#8220;Oh, this is pretty dope.&#8221; But to hear your story and to hear it in your own words, to talk about how you managed to overcome not just setbacks that have happened in life to you physically and professionally, but just even the emotional setbacks &#8230; Sometimes, especially in this industry where there&#8217;s not a lot of people who look like us, there&#8217;s not a lot of role models or people that we can look to for things. Still having the perseverance to move forward and to succeed, to not only do that, but just bring people up with you as well, to inspire the next generation, I think, is really, really awesome. Thank you for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Leonard</b>:      Thank you so much for having me, man. I appreciate it. It was a lot of fun.</p>
