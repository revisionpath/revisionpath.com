Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that designers like working on projects that allow them to fully display their creativity and talent. For Ethan Baldwin, those projects just happen to revolve around what might not be considered that exciting by others &#8212; banking and finance. That outlook is one of the foundations behind Slash and Structure, his new brand strategy and visual identity design firm.</p>
<p>Ethan spoke about his passion for &#8220;making boring stuff less boring&#8221;, and how it&#8217;s been important for him to balance his artistic skills with other aspects of a career in design. We also talked about working in-house vs. being an external vendor, and Ethan shared how his education at Oberlin and his work in the agency and financial world in NYC helped shape his perspective as a designer and an entrepreneur. For Ethan, being involved in the creative process is about more than just making something look good &#8212; it&#8217;s about providing value, trusting the process, and staying connected to your craft!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m Ethan Baldwin. I am a creative director based in Brooklyn, New York. And this year, I have started a new brand strategy and visual identity design firm called Slash and Structure. So, say hi to me. I am a founder, entrepreneur, creative director, lover of all things beautiful and design forward and eye catching. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>How has the year been going for you so far since starting the business?</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been pretty good. I always tell people that the only downside has been kind of like the demons inside of my own head and trying not to get into my way. But within all the situations where I&#8217;m able to push forward and really focus on what I&#8217;m trying to accomplish, it&#8217;s all been pretty successful. It&#8217;s been such a joy to work on crafting something that I&#8217;m building from the ground up. And I&#8217;ve been working with some amazing clients so far. I&#8217;ve got to work on some very cool projects and it&#8217;s nice just being able to, what I say, raise this baby from birth. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Is there anything that you want to try to accomplish before the year ends? I mean, this could be business-wise or not.</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>I would say from a very business specific standpoint, I want to basically up my monthly run rate. We don&#8217;t need to necessarily talk about specifics of numbers, but I do think having that kind of like, business financial goal in mind is incredibly important. And really I want to have an established four to six clients by the end of the year that I can see that longevity with. Like really kind of like&#8230;I will say the partnership feels like a family. It&#8217;s all still very new. We&#8217;ve got some great relationships. So it&#8217;s all about building those connections outside of the work itself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, you know, since you talked about your studio Slash and Structure, let&#8217;s dive more into that. What was behind the idea of you starting the studio?</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. So I worked as a visual designer for many years now. I got my start in advertising and then after freelancing for quite some time, I mainly started working on the client side of things, working either for design teams or designing for marketing teams. Also a little bit of product work, but after my last job, that job fell through. Got let go. Kind of like that post-pandemic&#8230;I&#8217;ll say, like, that post-pandemic bubble kind of burst. I realized I didn&#8217;t want to be in an office anymore unless it was the group of people that I really felt that I could build a team or family with. There was a product that I was super passionate about, but really I just wanted to create something that really tapped into my design methodology, like the way I run projects and the way I see the world.</p>
<p>And given all the places that I&#8217;ve worked in the past, I knew there was something that I can tap into based on the way I do think that could be of service to people, and I could be of better service doing it from my own firm versus trying to do it and change things from inside another corporation. So that really was the impetus to start the company. And the name Slash and Structure. Slash has always been in kind of like my artistic forward usernames for many years now. And it always kind of stemmed from&#8230;I do this, I do design programming, I do print, digital. And there is always that push that I got from people, like, &#8220;you really need to niche down. You really need to focus on serving one particular audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it was a lot of figuring out how I can do that. Again, you want a good business to serve a specific audience. But just being me and having this brain that wants to pick up on so many things, my experience got me to where I am by being able to pick up a whole bunch of different skill sets and talents and interests. So having that slash in there, being able to see a whole bunch of different either types of mediums or types of industries to really get people to focus on what their goals are and what their content is and how I can then put visuals on top of it, I guess that kind of became the throughline for all of my work. It&#8217;s really about helping people figure out what it is that they want to do or build or sell, and I can apply a number of different mediums or modalities to help them achieve that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So you&#8217;re bringing basically to their project&#8230;slash structure?</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. (laughs) In my business, the slashing is going through whatever they have so far. So usually when I&#8217;m working with the client, it usually starts like, &#8220;I want a website,&#8221; or &#8220;I want a motion graphics piece,&#8221; or &#8220;I want this set of collateral.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;okay, that&#8217;s all well and good, but we need to figure out who you are, what you&#8217;re about, what you&#8217;re trying to say.&#8221; And so that&#8217;s another play on the slash part. We take all of the stuff that you&#8217;ve kind of set up for yourself. We slash it all apart. We look at what all the individual pieces are and we figure out how to put them back together in a way that makes sense for you and for your audience or for your desired customers.</p>
<p>And then the structure comes after. The structure is building those systems in place, giving you the platform that you need and then giving you a way forward that&#8217;s scalable. Because at the end of the day, while I want to keep all of these partnerships, my biggest thing is I want to build solutions &#8212; design based solutions &#8212; that clients will use on their own if they need to update their content on the website. I make sure that the sites that I build have a robust CMS so that they can update their own content, they can change their own pictures. Because it&#8217;s always those little things that clients tend to get so wrapped up about. And I&#8217;m like, that&#8217;s the least important part of all of this process. That&#8217;s the least important part of your growth.</p>
<p>I want to make those things as easy as possible. Clients can focus on building their business and talking about themselves and really figuring out who they are and getting that out there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>How&#8217;s business been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>Pretty good. A bit of a, I would say&#8230;there&#8217;s like that standard slowdown in the summer. And to be perfectly honest, a lot of that was mainly coming from me. I needed to take a break physically and emotionally. As I was talking about, I had a nice little vacation this summer, went away for three weeks, and now I&#8217;m kind of getting back into the swing of things. And it&#8217;s weird because as much as I needed that break, I have missed that energy of bringing in new clients and working on multiple design projects simultaneously. It&#8217;s an ebb and flow with the business. So this fall is going to be picking back up pretty&#8230;I would say pretty steadily pretty soon.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Are there specific types of clients that you prefer to work with in a particular area, like healthcare or business or something like that?</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>I would say I like to focus on, in terms of client size, I like to focus on solo entrepreneurs or like very small teams that are just building, or larger companies that have a bunch of systems in place that they&#8217;re looking to improve upon. And I mainly focus on SaaS platforms, technology, anything that usually tends to have a whole bunch of data points, whether that be tons of customers or tons of product segments. But anything that tends to have a lot of data points that need to get organized and that usually falls inside of the tech and digital product space.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And I&#8217;d imagine that probably draws on your background too. I mean, prior to you starting Slash and Sructure, you were at Clear, which you mentioned earlier. So it&#8217;s kind of feeding into that in a way.</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. The majority of my experience really has been kind of working with a product or a platform that at face value can seem like very boring or everyday and figuring out ways to make it appear more luxury or make it more accessible to a wider audience, or just provide some clarity for people to understand it better. And in all of those places that I&#8217;ve worked with my clients now, it really goes to what I always call &#8220;what is your flag in the sand.&#8221; What is the one thing that you&#8217;re trying to say? What is the one person that you&#8217;re trying to reach? And finding that flag in the sand is hard because we naturally want to get as many audience &#8212; people in our audience as possible &#8212; reach as many people as possible, make everybody happy. These [are] things that I struggle with as well. The more that we find the specific person that we&#8217;re trying to reach and improve and serve, the better reach we end up getting, because the connections that we create in our business end up making more sense. We find the people that fit what we do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What are some dream projects that you&#8217;d love to do through the studio?</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>I would love to do a platform rebrand for some boring banking product or something in, like, I&#8217;m thinking of&#8230;these aren&#8217;t boring breaking products, but these new products that are coming out in the financial space like Chime or Rocket Money &#8212; these things that are finding, I would say, contemporary ways to do very boring tasks like bookkeeping. What is a way that those products can be packaged and presented in a way that gets people more excited about doing their monthly bookkeeping keeping or doing their taxes and not having this weird aversion to having to do all the boring stuff? I&#8217;m always trying to find ways to make boring stuff less boring because that&#8217;s how I have to function as a designer. If there&#8217;s a tedium, it is always hard for me to get started. So always looking for those types of projects &#8212; there&#8217;s that end. It sounds real weird, but I love doing annual reports; again, anything where I get to play with large amounts of data, making charts and making graphs and making those things move and ways that we can provide more understanding through visuals. Those are things that I really get behind.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, you know, I&#8217;d also say the other thing about even if you&#8217;re in the market for doing not necessarily annual reports, but things like that, you can really find a way to become a part of a company&#8217;s design budget or marketing budget. Back when I had my studio and I was really doing a lot of design work with clients, my main goal was I wanted to be a line item on the budget, because then that way every year, you know, you&#8217;re getting some kind of work as a retainer or something like that. But annual reports, email newsletters, like any sort of thing that you can do continually and build that relationship with them, it ends up being really lucrative for the business. But also it provides you as a creative a lot of stability in what can be a very unstable&#8230;I mean, striking out on your own is never easy. You got to find clients, you got to do all the admin work and stuff like that. But having that level of steadiness allows you to then explore other things either through your studio or outside your studio. But you always have that rock to come back to.</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>Exactly. And it&#8217;s interesting that you mentioned the retainer model because that&#8217;s something newer that I picked up for my business and I&#8217;ve discovered in the past year that it really works for me. Part of it is exactly what you mentioned. Kind of like having that stable repeatable income coming in makes it easier to focus on growing the business or growing different projects in or out of the business. But from a client perspective, I like the retainer model because it allows me to grow with a client and really help them see and understand the creative process and specifically the identity creative process. Like getting into brand style guides, going like &#8220;this is why this purple shows up in all of these places&#8221;&#8230;having that ongoing design relationship with someone, you get those aha moments where they are starting to realize that &#8220;oh, that&#8217;s why you did that&#8221; as a creative. And so that&#8217;s how I kind of divide up my business.</p>
<p>I have kind of like the brand strategy, brand building side of things which is project-based and those are usually focused with smaller business or solo entrepreneurs that are looking to grow something from scratch. And then I have the retainer model, and those usually go with larger companies that are kind of like &#8220;we need someone to do X number of banners&#8221; or &#8220;do this video.&#8221; And what I&#8217;ve seen is that through that retainer process, it usually helps clients see we don&#8217;t need a lot of the dumb stuff that we ask for. It teaches them how to use more templates. Yes, you have me on a retainer and I will do whatever that you want me to do, but you probably don&#8217;t need me to do PowerPoint graphs all of the time. Once they see everything that&#8217;s capable and how things can be templatized and automated, they then start to focus on more of the big ticket projects that are going to give them more ROI. And that works for me because then I get to work on more interesting things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to say it&#8217;s a magic trick, but it&#8217;s kind of a magic trick in a way because sometimes companies don&#8217;t really know what they need creatively until they have a creative on staff. And then, as you&#8217;re able &#8212; that&#8217;s even in a freelance capacity &#8212; but then once you&#8217;re doing that work for them, they&#8217;re like &#8220;oh wait a minute, you can do this&#8221; and &#8220;we could do this&#8221; and &#8220;maybe we don&#8217;t need to do this.&#8221; They&#8217;re going to trust you also because you&#8217;ve built that relationship over time and it&#8217;s less of kind of this one off sort of thing that you have to try to win them over about.</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>Exactly. And piggybacking off of that. One thing that I&#8217;ve noticed on going off on my own and working as a vendor for clients versus working in house. There&#8217;s this weird, I don&#8217;t know, mindset that when you&#8217;re working as an outside expert, there&#8217;s a heightened level of understanding or at the very least, respect for what it is that you do. Because for a lot of the things that I&#8217;m doing now, they&#8217;re the exact same things that I did at places working in house. But because to a certain extent, people are now coming to me to solve very specific problems versus just me being there to just, quote, unquote, &#8220;do things,&#8221; I&#8217;m able to get people to shift their briefs a bit better so they&#8217;re improved, or they&#8217;re like, &#8220;maybe you don&#8217;t need to do this. Let&#8217;s do this.&#8221; There&#8217;s more opportunity for rapport, and it&#8217;s weirdly because I&#8217;m not on their payroll, or I&#8217;m a line item, but I&#8217;m not on their payroll. It&#8217;s weird.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like a mental shift where they feel like they can get more out of having this vendor relationship, like, more value from it. I haven&#8217;t been able to figure out what that is, but it&#8217;s one of the biggest things I&#8217;ve noticed after making this shift.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Value is good. I mean, never discount that at all.</p>
<p>Now there&#8217;s more about your career I want to get into. Of course, you&#8217;ve had a very prolific career, and we&#8217;ll get into that a bit later. But before we do that, let&#8217;s kind of learn more about Ethan. Let&#8217;s learn more about you as a person.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re based out of Brooklyn currently. Is that where you&#8217;re from originally?</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>No, So I&#8217;m originally from Washington, DC. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay. </p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>And my whole family is from deep &#8220;dirty south&#8221; Aiken, South Carolina. But I&#8217;ve been in New York since I left college in 2006. So I feel like I can officially say that I am a New Yorker now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay. Now, did you sort of always have this interest in design and everything growing up? Like, was it something that your family cultivated or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>So, strangely enough, my mom is also a visual artist, so she was a photographer for the Smithsonian basically her entire career. She just retired about a year ago, and she&#8217;s also a fine art painter, ceramicist, and she does a lot of tapestry work, so she kind of like the idea of having all of these artistic hobbies, I would say, came from her being a multihyphenate, so to speak. </p>
<p>But in terms of a line of study, I actually started as a theater kid. Ever since I was little, I did theater. I did dance. I went to school. I joined the theater program and did that up until halfway through my junior year. And there was just a shift of, like, I&#8217;ve always wanted to create things, but I&#8217;ve realized I wanted to be more behind the scenes, and I wanted to create either physical things or things that just had a bit more, I would say, staying power that weren&#8217;t as ephemeral as a stage performance.</p>
<p>And I always had an interest growing up dance. I always had an interest in dancing, choreography, and my main goal I always wanted to do music videos.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay!</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>That was kind of like the biggest thing that got me into the visual arts and why I jumped into advertising. I&#8217;m going to be that person who makes the next Gap commercial. And so that&#8217;s when I made that shift in college. And we didn&#8217;t have a marketing program at Oberlin, but I wanted to focus on making beautiful images. So my studio art focus was photography, and my senior thesis was a coffee table book called Ego Boost, and it was really just editorial photography for my friends. And the point was, I truly feel that everyone should deserve to feel like a celebrity for at least an hour. So I made this coffee table book, and then we made all these posters with all of my friends who modeled, and we put the posters around the school, and then we made these little collector cards that people could pick up. And then instead of having the thesis show in the museum, which was kind of standard, I had it in the student union and ended up making this huge white party, like Puff Daddy style white party.</p>
<p>And then I built these translucent, lit up walls to house all of my photography. And my friend from the dance group I was in, he had the DJ, and we had a bar. And it was the art world, but in a way that was fun and fit, like the community that I&#8217;m from. It had that performance piece to it, but it still focused on photography. It was very hip-hop focused, very focused around dance, but at its core, it was fun. The whole point is that all of this stuff is supposed to be fun. </p>
<p>Being a designer, being a creative, we have these jobs that make no sense. Think about it. But we&#8217;re able to tap into something that&#8217;s really kind of magical, especially in our clients, because we&#8217;re able to make those connections with things that people can&#8217;t necessarily verbalize or we can see something out in the world or can hear a piece of music or see watch a movie and have that be the foundation to build a whole bunch of new ideas. And we somehow made that into a job. It&#8217;s wild, but that&#8217;s what&#8217;s fun about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So while you were there, you majored in visual arts, and certainly this sounds like it was a visual art production in some capacity. How was your time there overall?</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>It took me a while to appreciate Oberlin for the school that it was. I mean, it&#8217;s a great school, very hippie dippy school, but it&#8217;s also a school that has such a rich history, especially when it comes to what they&#8217;ve done for marginalized communities, what they&#8217;ve done for specifically Black people in America. And it&#8217;s also a school known for having this amazing conservatory. So even if you&#8217;re not a musically inclined person, you&#8217;re always surrounded by music and opera, great dance, theater. It was a great place to be specifically for the arts, considering that it&#8217;s not an art school. So, yeah, I fully appreciate being at Oberlin until I made that switch from doing theater and going into visual arts, because that&#8217;s where I really found that my creativity aligned with who I was. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>I tell everyone &#8220;everybody should go to Oberlin.&#8221; It was a great school.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So Oberlin kind of pushed you in this other direction then, sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I would say Oberlin gave me the space to find that other direction because I didn&#8217;t know that I wanted to go into advertising. I can&#8217;t even really say that I wanted to go into advertising. I knew I wanted to dance, and I wanted to make videos. Like, when I was a kid in middle school, I would make behind the scenes music videos of the musical cast. So almost like Behind The Music before the High School Musical. I just wanted to do some sort of upbeat music media that, I don&#8217;t know, got people moving, got people dancing, and Oberlin gave me the space to figure that out. There wasn&#8217;t a marketing program. There&#8217;s a studio art program, but it wasn&#8217;t like a fine art program that you&#8217;d get at an art school or a design school. It really taught us how to find what our voices are, find what it is that we want to do, and then do that successfully.</p>
<p>I got a good amount of fine art training for photography while I was at Oberlin. Shout out to Professor Pipo [Nguyen-Duy]. He was the absolute best. But the biggest thing that it taught me was how to prepare a show, how to work on an outline, how to sell an idea, like how to fund all of the stuff that you&#8217;re trying to build. It strangely taught me a lot about the business of being a creative.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, I think that&#8217;s a great thing to get in college, especially because from other people that I&#8217;ve talked with on the show that have went into design or they discovered design in college, business wasn&#8217;t really an aspect of that. I think there might have been one or two folks that I&#8217;ve had on where there was some sort of business component along with their design, but they ended up having to sort of pick up those skills later in the real world. Not in a very sort of, I would say safe &#8212; I mean, I think college is a safe environment to learn and to grow, in that aspect &#8212; but it sounds like Oberlin really provided that for you, though.</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I would say as part of the senior thesis program, I think they pick it&#8217;s like 10 or 15 students. And one of the biggest projects is we do a big trip to New York, and you get kind of, like, fully immersed into the art scene, but really, like, the business of the art scene. So we visited all of these galleries throughout Hell&#8217;s Kitchen in Chelsea and met with all of these kind of curators and gallery owners. And it was really to teach us how to learn how to pitch. Like, how do you take whatever your artistic, creative idea is and make it so other people will want to fund it, someone will want to put it up, how to get your own ideas out of your head so that someone else can comprehend them. So we each had to &#8212; it was basically like a pitch challenge &#8212; we each had to learn how to pitch inside of the environment of an actual New York museum. It was scary as hell, but that was more important in the long run than any kind of fine art training, I would say. And I&#8217;m eternally grateful to the arts program at Oberlin for that, because anyone can pick up an artistic skill, a fine arts skill; but if it&#8217;s something that you want to make into a career, I always tell people 80% of my job now has nothing to do with me designing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So once you graduated, you started working for an agency, working for DDB as a junior art director. Knowing that you had this sort of business skill that you had acquired from Oberlin, how was your time there? Like, what do you remember from that time?</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>DDB was one of the best jobs I ever had, mainly because of the network that I built. The people that I met on that job, I&#8217;m still friends with a lot of them to this day. One thing I do want to shout out about that job is I got that job through the MAIP program or the Multicultural Advertising Internship Program. And MAIP is part of the 4A&#8217;s Foundation, and they just do amazing work with bringing awareness of the marketing advertising industry to students of color throughout the nation. So I owe a lot to that organization for helping me land that job. I got the internship through that program, and DDB hired me after the internship. And at DDB, I learned a lot about who I was as a creative. It was a very kind of standard house.</p>
<p>I worked on some very cool clients. I got do some storyboards for Diet Pepsi. My favorite project from that time was making a bunch of billboards for Subaru and then getting to see them get put up over the PCH. That was, like, one of the coolest things because something that I created was now 50 feet in the air. But I learned that there is a big difference &#8212; and it seems to be more apparent now &#8212; there&#8217;s a big difference between the design side of things and the art direction side of things. And I don&#8217;t necessarily think that there should be. </p>
<p>But I knew after that job, I think I was there&#8230;I was there for almost two years after that. I knew I wanted to focus more about how to find my design voice, and that&#8217;s why I jumped into this long phase of freelancing. After that, I got a job at the Apple Store working late nights and then would just take different freelance jobs throughout the day. I recommend every creative go through a phase of just picking up freelance projects. If I was to say one thing that everyone should do, it is that the best way to figure out what your design voice or what you love doing is to really just try out a whole bunch of different things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I want to go back to what you said about sort of the difference between art direction and visual design that you just mentioned. Can you unpack that a little bit?</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. It&#8217;s funny. One of the things I discovered after doing a bunch of freelancing and then kind of wanting to settle into a full time job, that having been out of the advertising game, so to speak, it was harder to get back into it. Because in most advertising firms, your design function, like your design talent, usually ends up being part of a production team. And your art directors and your copywriters, they&#8217;re the ones who are coming up with the ideas for campaigns, print campaigns, motion graphics, commercials. A lot of it kind of started with the ideas of making the commercial or the print ad, but the art director would kind of come up with the visual ideas, but they weren&#8217;t necessarily illustrating or drawing or building the site for a multimedia campaign. They were kind of like coming up with the ideas with the copywriter partner and then eventually that would go to production. And there was something about that that I missed.</p>
<p>I want to push the pixels and do some of the illustration, and I don&#8217;t really do that now. There are people who are much better illustrators than I am, so I&#8217;m obviously going to farm that work out. But there was such a divide between the design and the art director. That&#8217;s where the slash originally came from. I have a very close friend of mine that I met at DDB and she said to me, &#8220;at this point, you need to decide, do you want to be an art director? Go down like, the art director to creative director to chief creative officer path down an advertising journey, or do you want to be a designer going to being a senior designer, working for a design firm, working for a production house?&#8221; And I couldn&#8217;t agree with either of those options. There has to be something that has both, because I always knew I wanted to work on the big ideas, but I also wanted to have a hand in how it was crafted. That craft is, again, like the fun part.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve seen with a lot of kind of people at the director level that it&#8217;s very easy to get jaded and you lose sight of the thing that made you want to do all of this. Like pulling out crayons, pulling out markers, getting on a whiteboard or a sketchbook and drawing out ideas or figures or little stick people or landscapes. That connection to the craft is still incredibly important to me, and especially like when working with my clients, I would say that&#8217;s one of the things that I offer. I am going to help you work through your ideas, your high level ideas, to build your campaign or build your website or build your next video piece or whatever the project is. But I also want you to trust that I&#8217;m going to make something for you with you that is also going to be pretty. It&#8217;s going to be beautiful. The content is always more important, but creating something that is beautifully designed and constructed and illustrated is just such a great feeling.</p>
<p>And so I wanted to make sure that that divide of being a creative director and being a designer didn&#8217;t really exist for me. I don&#8217;t really see the need for that divide. If you have a larger company and you can section out those functions, then great, good on you, but that&#8217;s not what I want. For me, I wouldn&#8217;t want to be either or. I think having both allows me to serve people better.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it sounds like you didn&#8217;t want to have that, I guess you could call it&#8230;a restriction in a way. You wanted to be able to do it all.</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, and that was kind of the moment where I realized I probably wouldn&#8217;t work for an ad agency again. And not necessarily because I didn&#8217;t want to, but because it&#8217;s like talking with hiring managers. They want to see that you&#8217;ve worked on X number of commercials or X number of campaigns. And I was like, &#8220;well, I&#8217;ve worked on plenty of campaigns and I&#8217;ve worked on tons of video pieces, but not necessarily in the context of an ad agency.&#8221; In all of the places that I&#8217;ve worked, I&#8217;ve been able to work on long form video and full website builds and beautiful out of home print work and big event installations. I really just started to love working in house because the idea of that divide was less apparent.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, you&#8217;ve done a lot of, you know, freelance work. You&#8217;ve also worked full time at some pretty prestigious places. You were at Dow Jones for a number of years. You were at PulsePoint. You were at qbeats. Earlier you mentioned being at Clear. We don&#8217;t have to go into those particular ones individually unless you want to, but I&#8217;d love to know, when you look back at those experiences as a collective, what sort of stands out to you the most? And it can be multiple things too.</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I would say for all of those jobs, my biggest thing is I wanted to do something that would somehow leave a mark. And it doesn&#8217;t have to necessarily be my mark, but something that&#8217;s going to change the way, whatever place that was thought about how they did business, or they did design or they went into a website build or thought about branding. And if anything, I would say I&#8217;ve been able to achieve that throughline in all of those places, Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal&#8230;that was a particularly weird but fun and exciting experience because it was one of those places &#8212; and this goes back to the idea of in house spots being a bit less restrictive on what your experience is and where you&#8217;ve worked. I got hired there. My title was multimedia communications manager. Who knows what that means? And it was within the HR department.</p>
<p>And I remember my interview&#8230;one thing that stood out to them was the fact that I told one of my interviewers that I tap dance. And I remember there was at some point where someone asked me to do a shuffle step in an interview and I was like, &#8220;I will do this once.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh no! Noooo&#8230;. </p>
<p>It was pretty far along.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay&#8230;.</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>I was like, this is&#8230;we&#8217;re treading.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&#8217;s tap dancing metaphorically for an interview and then there&#8217;s that&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>&#8230;literal tactic. (laughs)</p>
<p>Yeah. But that job taught me so much again, about crafting what it is I want to be doing and what the things I love doing can be of service for who I&#8217;m doing it for, because there was no precedent for my job in that function and inside of the learning and development team, but what I got to work on was building a whole bunch of internal campaigns, and it really actually brought out my love for learning and development in particular and building training programs and building curriculums for other employees. </p>
<p>One of the biggest things there was being able to help start the DJ program or Digital Journalism at Dow Jones. And it was all about bridging the gap between kind of print journalism and digital journalism. And so we did multiple versions of this week long training program in New York, Princeton, London and Hong Kong where we talked about the business as a whole. But we also got to do very specific trainings. Like this is how you can use your iPhone to shoot footage on the fly for a smaller piece. Or here are the rules around photo licensing so you don&#8217;t get sued. It got into very specific trainings and that was just so fun for me because we immediately got to see the results from our efforts. And I knew from that that part of what I want to do as a designer, as a creative is help teach people how to do things better or how to make a process easier. </p>
<p>This goes to working for Clear, and one of the big things there was revamping the website and eventually moving to the Webflow platform. I will talk about Webflow all day long. I absolutely love that. But one thing that was really important to me was getting everybody, like all of the stakeholders, on some sort of system that they could start focusing on their own content and inserting their own content where it needed to go versus always being dependent on a developer or on me and the design team within marketing to do something like make a new blog entry or insert a new airport location.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need a team of designers to do something like that. So my goal was to build a system in place and then teach people to kind of do those content updates for themselves. And it makes the working relationship so much easier. And there&#8217;s always that aha moment where I&#8217;m like, &#8220;oh, no, you updated that web page. You updated a web page. You just built a new web page.&#8221; Of course, me and my team, we do all the stuff on the back end to make those templates and whatnot. But you now see that it wasn&#8217;t about how beautifully is it designed, or &#8220;am I going to break something if I enter in this bit of tech?&#8221; No.</p>
<p>As designers, one of our biggest goals is to create solutions that help people do things better. If you&#8217;re designing a chair, you want that chair to be beautiful, but it also needs to sit someone&#8217;s butt. Design without function is just art &#8212; which has its place &#8212; but function in, again, serving someone and making their life easier is always at the forefront of what I do now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Is there anything different about how you do business now as opposed to when you first started freelancing? Because you mentioned you were kind of working at the Apple store, you were also freelancing, so I would imagine even just kind of trying to juggle work and freelance work was a bit hard. But outside of that, what do you do different now that you did when you first started?</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>Well, when I first started freelancing, it was a little bit different because I mainly worked through placement agencies, so it was like people would often find work for me, and I would work on those projects on whatever basis that they have. And now I pretty much do all of finding clients through word of mouth or through my own lead generation. So that&#8217;s one kind of logistical difference. And at some point, I may jump back to using a placement agency. I have absolutely nothing against them. It&#8217;s just not something that I&#8217;m doing right now. But in terms of knowing more about myself and how I operate as a creative, I would say the biggest change is I will not work on a project if I know I just absolutely don&#8217;t want to do it. It&#8217;s one of the biggest things I tell younger designers.</p>
<p>I had one job &#8212; we don&#8217;t need to go into who it is &#8212; but it was a job that I was incredibly excited about. It was a big name and great for a resume. But working there? No one&#8217;s happy and none of the products are particularly interesting. And at its core, it was just a job and the pay wasn&#8217;t that great. It really just was a bad stepping stone, I would say. But all of that is to say that when you&#8217;re starting out, there&#8217;s always this pain in your chest about making sure you have enough money, making sure your rent gets paid, and making sure you have enough coming in so you don&#8217;t have to just keep focusing on work. But I&#8217;ve learned now that if the work itself is not either fulfilling and enough to make it worthwhile to work on, or they&#8217;re just paying, you absolutely extravagantly, finding a job just to find a job as a creative usually is not worth it. </p>
<p>As a creative, you&#8217;re not going to perform your best if you don&#8217;t want to be there. Your clients are not going to be served in the way they should be served because you don&#8217;t want to be there. And it&#8217;s just going to be miserable for everyone involved. And at all of this, at the end of it, you probably won&#8217;t even get a good portfolio of it because you&#8217;re not exactly proud of anything you&#8217;ve done. So I would say it&#8217;s better for me to sit and work on some back-end stuff than just jumping into a job just because the job has presented itself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Outside of that, how would you say you&#8217;ve just grown creatively? Like, how have you grown as a creative over the years?</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve definitely become more efficient. I would say I just developed a lot of processes to help get to an end product faster. And I would say I&#8217;ve also learned to give myself a lot more grace and knowledge that not everything is always going to be perfect. I can definitely say that I am a very good designer, but I am not the best. And I&#8217;m not going to be the right choice for every single client that comes my way. And being able to say, &#8220;oh, I&#8217;m not the right fit for you, let me recommend somebody else,&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m just not the right fit for this project&#8221; because secretly I just don&#8217;t want to do that. It&#8217;s not going to give me anything outside of the paycheck. And being okay with that, that took a lot of growth.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s okay to say no. And I&#8217;ve learned that we as creatives, we can have more stock in ourselves. We think about other service industries, think about mechanics, you think about electricians, and they have this very specific skill set. They&#8217;re able to do this thing amazingly well. And for whatever reason, I&#8217;ve noticed that as creatives, we tend to not think about ourselves in that same way, because the thing that we do isn&#8217;t necessarily as tangible, but the results that we provide to people are. And so we focus on, like, &#8220;I built this website, but that website increased conversions by X&#8221; or &#8220;this social media campaign increased this company&#8217;s Instagram followers by Y.&#8221; There are tangible results, tangible business results to the beautiful, weird idea connections that we make as creatives. And I think we need to start giving ourselves more stock in ourselves because of that.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s another thing that I&#8217;ve learned.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Who are some of the people that have really kind of helped you out in terms of mentorship or anything like that over the years throughout your career?</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>I would say one of the biggest people I follow, and this is everyone kind of [inaudible 49:01] follows this person, but Chris Do of The Futur has always been like one of those people that&#8230;if there&#8217;s a conference, I may or may not go, but if he&#8217;s there, I likely will go, because he has a very no nonsense, matter of fact approach to not just being a creative, but really how to be a creative business, how to run a business and how to get through the day of running a business in a way that isn&#8217;t confusing. It kind of just is what it is. And he keeps it kind of, like, &#8220;follow what I say or don&#8217;t.&#8221; There&#8217;s a level of confidence there that I find so admirable because that is also, again, that&#8217;s eventually the level of confidence that I want to be at. That&#8217;s the level of confidence that I want to give to all of my clients. Everyone should feel that good about what they do and what they provide to the people that they do services for. </p>
<p>And then I would say a more personal mentor is actually one of my old &#8212; technically technically, she&#8217;s still a current client &#8212; but one of my old bosses at PulsePoint, Maria Simeone, we&#8217;ve had such a weird working relationship, and I think it&#8217;s just a matter of fact, we work really well together. But she&#8217;s very much a marketing brain from the strategy and the business side of things.</p>
<p>And I learned so much about marketing from that standpoint, from her, because that&#8217;s not how I approach problem solving at all, but just watching her work while we&#8217;re at PulsePoint and then watching her grow within the company and even grow further. Even after I left, she always kind of looked back to see what I was doing, would always give me really good advice. She&#8217;s always been open to critique me on our work. And she also has a very similar no nonsense way of, I would say, gathering me together, which I appreciate. I&#8217;m very much a tough love type of person because it shows me that you care and that you&#8217;re invested, but you&#8217;re also not going to let me fall completely on my face.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So what does success look like for you now? I mean, you&#8217;ve got your studio. You&#8217;re out on your own. What does success look like at this stage in your career?</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>For me, success is being able to do what I want, when I want. And that&#8217;s really to say if there&#8217;s a day that I&#8217;m not feeling well or I just need a break and I just need to go walk in a forest &#8212; I really love camping &#8212; but to be able to just go do that and make sure I have rapport built with my clients to say that I&#8217;m not going to be working or to have enough of the work done and a system in place that I&#8217;m not needed 100% of the time or being able to travel as I see fit and work as I travel&#8230;I try to keep a very, I would say, like, lean tech profile so I can really do what I do from anywhere. Like, I have just like one small MacBook Air and then I have one larger Pro for video work, but I mainly just work on laptops because some days I want to go work in the middle of Central Park and so I can do that. That&#8217;s what success looks like for me. Because for some people, success might be a number amount, like a number of clients or revenue goal, and I have those goals from a business perspective. But success really looks like being able to take a vacation and not have to sit there and tally up the number of vacation days I have left or not feel guilty about taking a sick day. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s always wild to me. I would always tell my team this back when I worked in an office: &#8220;if you&#8217;re sick, go be sick and get better.&#8221; I don&#8217;t need you trying to&#8230;you&#8217;re not showing that you&#8217;re any more of, like, a badass because you&#8217;re working while you&#8217;re dripping snot all over your face. Get out of the office, go home, go rest. But there&#8217;s this weird&#8230;we&#8217;re in this working society where every one of those things are tallied and counted for and often used against you. And that&#8217;s something I just cannot stand for personally. And I&#8217;m sure that will get me in a lot of trouble with a lot of places, but I&#8217;d much rather see people do what they need to do to take care of themselves so that when they do work, they are working at 100% of their capacity and 100% of their joy. Again, if you don&#8217;t want to be here, don&#8217;t be here. That&#8217;s how I run my business.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s something I don&#8217;t want to do, I&#8217;m not going to do it. It&#8217;s not going to make me happy, it&#8217;s not going to make a client happy. No one&#8217;s going to be happy in this. So, yeah, success is being able to do what I want, when I want.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. To that end, where do you see yourself in the next five years? What sort of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>I would say in five years I want to have some big national tech brands under my belt. I want to work on some internal rebrands. I&#8217;m thinking of something like&#8230;I recently got to meet someone who worked on Chase Sapphire and working on this luxury sub brand inside of this big financial institution. And that would be a dream project for me, taking all of these kind of boring things like credit cards and points and really building this almost lifestylish brand around that very boring thing. So more of those within the next five years. But really it&#8217;s just scaling what I do now to just hit maybe a couple more clients each month. But I actually really enjoy how lean things are and being able to work with freelancers as needed. But as of right now, I don&#8217;t really see growing employees, too many employees inside of the business. I like the flexibility of building a network, so to speak, versus building another office.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more about you, about your work, about the studio? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>
<p>You can find my personal previous work at ethanbaldwin.com. You can find and sign up for an engagement with the business at slashandstructure.com. That&#8217;s no spaces, no underscores, just slashandstructure.com. And there you&#8217;ll learn a bit more about how the business functions and some of the clients that I&#8217;ve been working with. And you can also find me on Instagram at instagram.com/slashandstructure. Really, if that double slash doesn&#8217;t work as well when you&#8217;re saying it out loud. (laughs) But yeah, instagram.com/slashandstructure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, sounds good. Ethan Baldwin, I definitely want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I like that you are someone right now that&#8217;s sort of striking out on their own, especially at this time when there&#8217;s so much happening in tech and design. I think also there&#8217;s just kind of this instability with working at companies at the moment. It feels like a really good time for a lot of people to kind of strike out and you certainly not only have the professional experience with the places you&#8217;ve worked, but you&#8217;ve freelanced before as well. So I&#8217;m really interested to see kind of where Slash instructor goes in the future.  So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Ethan Baldwin:</b></p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m Anjuan Simmons. And I am a staff engineering manager at GitHub.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So how has this year been going for you? Any highlights?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>Yes, I think one of the biggest highlights of this year is that my oldest son &#8212; and I have three children &#8212; and my oldest went to college. So we launched our first baby into university, and we literally, a few days ago, dropped him off at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is an incoming freshman. And we moved him into his dorm and we gave him hugs and we tried to not cry. And we got him installed in Jester West in his dorm, and we drove home without him. And it was a very fulfilling experience. It was a little bittersweet, but we&#8217;re super proud of him. And that has been a big highlight because a lot of this year was getting ready for that moment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow. Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I love how you say installed, like he was software. (laughs)</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>(laughs) I am a tech person.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So outside of that, do you have any sort of goals or accomplishments that you want to try to do before the year ends?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>Yes, I think one of the biggest goals that we had as a family; I mentioned that I have three children. My wife and I, we&#8217;ve been married for 21 years, and we do, as you might expect, a lot of family things, right? And so we wanted to have a really reflective and relaxing and connecting summer because, again, my oldest son was going to college. My middle child, a son, is starting his senior year. They just started a few weeks ago. Then my daughter is a sophomore, right? So that kind of gives you an idea of their ages. </p>
<p>And one of the things that we did this summer and we went back and forth on, like, do we want to do something? Do we want something elaborate? Right? Do we want to go to Lagos, Nigeria, or go to Amsterdam or whatever? Then we&#8230;no, no. Let&#8217;s just kind of tone it back. And so we did just a very simple family vacation where we went to Washington, D.C. for a few days, and then we took this Amtrak Express train from Washington, D.C. to New York City. And we spent time there because none of my kids had been to New York City. And we did all the touristy things. We went to the Statue of Liberty. We went to the Empire State Building. We did all these things. And it was just a nice family time. And so that was a major thing that we did this summer. And that may sound a little bit boring, but it was a delightful little small vacation. My middle son went to a summer program at UT because he&#8217;s interested in business like his older brother. And my daughter is on the dance team at high school, so she did a lot of things with her dance troupe. And so this was very much a family summer. So I would say that on a personal level, that was the biggest highlight of this year. </p>
<p>I would say that the other big highlight is that at work I promoted a Black woman and an Indian woman at work. And that was something that is truly gratifying. Not just because of their ethnicity &#8212; they were ready to go. They very much, very well deserved the promo. But I&#8217;ve promoted a lot of people in my career, Maurice, and just as a person of color, it was really great to be someone who could come alongside them as a manager, help them honestly overcome some of the imposter syndrome that I detected in them and then do the work to make sure that the organization could identify and respect their accomplishments and what they were bringing to the team that, hey, these people are ready for promo. They&#8217;re already doing their work in to get that done. And so out of all the many people I promote over my long career, and I&#8217;ve been doing this for over 25 years, that was very gratifying.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow. I mean, from the family end, I think a nice relaxing family vacation is definitely a great accomplishment, especially after the past two or three years with the pandemic. Like, even just being able to get out and do things tourist wise is great. So that&#8217;s good. And also you got to spend some time with your son before he went off to college. That&#8217;s a memory that I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll take with him. So that&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And since you mentioned work, let&#8217;s pivot to talking about what you&#8217;re doing at GitHub, where you work as a staff engineering manager. Tell me more about that.</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>Sure. So the team that I&#8217;m responsible for supporting is called GitHub Sponsors. And GitHub Sponsors is a program that started, I mean, really a few years ago, that is meant to allow open source maintainers to receive financial support. Right. So open source maintainers can receive financial support through GitHub Sponsors. And the reason that GitHub came up with this program is because GitHub one loves open source. But also we know that so many of the programs and the apps and the websites and the applications that run the world run on open source. There are so many dependencies that people have of these open source projects that make these projects that make these applications work.</p>
<p>And often the people who maintain those projects, they do it for free. They do it because they love the code or they wanted to solve a problem. And often they work an eight or nine hours at their day job and then they labor at night working on open source maintaining these projects that really transform the world and we want it. Or GitHub wanted to make the open source ecosystem sustainable so that these people who are really doing free labor can find reward for their work, but also ideally do it full time. And through GitHub Sponsors, I&#8217;ve heard stories of open source maintainers who were able to quit their day job and do their work full time, or perhaps they didn&#8217;t quit, but they were able to bring on a partner to help make the project better. And so that&#8217;s the team that I&#8217;m responsible for, the seven engineers on that team, I work very closely with the product manager, and so that is what I do at GitHub.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice. Is that a new program, or is that something GitHub has had for a while?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>We had it for a while. We&#8217;ve had it for about three years. It&#8217;s been in beta for most of its time, right, the time that it&#8217;s been available. But we recently took a GA in April of this year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice. Very nice. What does your typical day look like? I&#8217;m imagining you&#8217;re probably working remotely, or are you going into an office? What does your typical day look like?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>GitHub is fully remote. It&#8217;s been fully remote for a long time, way before the pandemic. And so my day starts with me waking up, walking maybe 20 paces into my office, and then I am at work. And so it&#8217;s funny, I tell people that I worked at Help Scout before GitHub, and I&#8217;ve had remote work as the way that I work for several years now. And I tell people it would take a lot for me to have to work in an office. And I know one of my colleagues said that they basically put, like, $100,000 figure on working from home, right? That if you had an opportunity that you wanted to take, it would have to be, like, 100K over what you&#8217;re making now if it required you to go into an office. </p>
<p>And so, yeah, I wake up, I walk into my office. I put some beans into my coffee machine. I make my coffee. I get my water because I got to stay hydrated. And then I log on to my GitHub-issued laptop. And then the first thing that I do, which is I think not very unusual, is that I check Slack and see what happened while I was sleeping. Where are the things that are going on with the GitHub? What&#8217;s happening with my team? I also check email, and one of the things that I think people may not know is that GitHub uses GitHub. We use GitHub for our daily work, and so we do what&#8217;s called dogfooding, right? We use the tools that we build every single day. And so one of the things that I do with checking Slack and checking my GitHub Gmail account is going to GitHub and looking at all of the notifications about all the issues that my team is working on. Or I&#8217;ll check on the pull requests &#8212; we call them PRs &#8212; or I&#8217;ll go into Siscussions. And so I use GitHub every day, because at GitHub, we use what we build for our daily work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Back when I worked at Glitch, it was very much the same way. Like any sort of project that we did, it was adamant that we used Glitch for the project. It was never anything like, &#8220;oh, let&#8217;s think about some third party whatever.&#8221; Anything we did had to sort of work within Glitch. So I&#8217;m certainly familiar with that concept of dogfooding. I&#8217;m curious though, because of that. And you mentioned before, this is one thing through GitHub Sponsors where you&#8217;re supporting other open source projects and things like that. Developers worldwide use GitHub for their work. What kind of problems internally is GitHub focused on solving?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>Yes, dogfooding lets you use the stuff that you build because you&#8217;ll see things, right, that customers are running. You know, I&#8217;ve gone in and said, &#8220;hey, the button on this form seems a little bit off center&#8221; and yeah, I can open up an issue and then send it to the team that owns that page and then they can fix. So, you know, a lot of the reason that we use GitHub at GitHub is to really make GitHub better, right? So that&#8217;s one thing, that&#8217;s one problem that we&#8217;re working on, because while GitHub&#8217;s been around for a long time, it&#8217;s not a perfect product, we know that, but we&#8217;re dedicated to making it a little more perfect every single day, right? One of the other big challenges that we&#8217;re working on, or a big problem, is what we call developer experience. The developer experience is what developers go through while they&#8217;re building code. And so we want to make the development experience one where you feel that the tools that you use don&#8217;t get into your way and that you&#8217;re able to do the best work of your day, every day based on the tool set, right? So a lot of that is based on how we design GitHub, and GitHub&#8217;s always changing. If you use GitHub, you know about GitHub, like I said, pull requests, you know about issues, you know about the other parts of GitHub. And we&#8217;re very much invested in their entire teams dedicated to those functions that I just mentioned. But one of the biggest things about the developer experience is Copilot.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;re going to talk about this quite a bit, but Copilot is our AI tool that is your artificial intelligence peer programmer. It&#8217;s like having the best engineer that you ever heard of working with you to help your code become better. So Copilot is a key part of what we&#8217;re doing in AI at GitHub. It&#8217;s transformational. I think that we&#8217;re doing some amazing work. Again, we&#8217;ll probably talk about that some more later. One of the other tools that I think is super cool is called Code Spaces, which is basically your developer environment in the cloud where you can log in. And instead of having to do what I did when I started developing 25 years ago and installing all these tools and installed my IDE and my dependencies installed my database, install all these helper applications.</p>
<p>You just log in to basically browse, experience, it&#8217;s all there. You can start coding. And so we want to remove obstacles between the idea and the implementation and Copilot and code spaces and just GitHub itself are really some of the things that we&#8217;re working on to make that trip.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, yeah, let&#8217;s actually go into talking about AI. I know I mentioned to you before we started recording that it&#8217;s been sort of a running theme on this show for the past two years now. Like everyone that we&#8217;ve had on in some capacity, I ask them about how is this cutting edge tech, AI, machine learning, generative AI, et cetera. How is that sort of affecting the work that you do or what does it mean for the work that you do? So how do you use this sort of cutting edge tech? At GitHub? You mentioned Copilot, but are there other sorts of programs or initiatives that you all are working on?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>So, to go back to my team, right, GitHub Sponsors. So GitHub is a Ruby on Rails application, right? So at the end of the day, that is what runs GitHub. GitHub, for the most part runs on Ruby on Rails. And so we do a few things, right? We very much contribute to new versions of Ruby on Rails, right? We also upgrade our code, right? So we have entire teams that are kitted to that. So I would say Ruby on Rails as tools are really big at GitHub. We also use other tool sets like React, right, which is a popular front-end framework for building programs. I mean, there&#8217;s a whole host of programs and languages that we use at GitHub. We also obviously host a lot of the code for open source frameworks, right? Like React and Vue and Laravel.</p>
<p>And so GitHub not only uses a lot of cutting edge technology, we are also the home for a lot of the cutting edge technology that are used today. And so we take that responsibility very seriously. So we always want to make sure that we&#8217;re available, that we&#8217;re secure and so working on those functions, right? So it&#8217;s not just having a place or having a repository for your code UT. We also want to make sure that we&#8217;re highly available, we&#8217;re highly secure, that all those things are by default. And I want to spend a little bit of time putting maybe a pin on that. No tool is useful if you can&#8217;t get to it, and no tool is useful if it will expose your sensitive information. And so security and availability are like super core concerns at GitHub. And I want to make sure that it&#8217;s clear that we spend a massive amount of tools, a massive amount of people, and a massive amount of just thought space, all those subjects.</p>
<p>And so that&#8217;s really something that is really important to make sure that we understand. We also spend a lot of time on privacy because, again, a lot of personal information resides on GitHub. And so we do a lot of work around that too. So it&#8217;s more than just code. Code is obviously a core concept, but it&#8217;s all those things around code that we spend a lot of time thinking about and solving for.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m so glad you mentioned availability, because like you said, GitHub hosts a lot of code for other projects. And I&#8217;ve seen on the web, like, when GitHub goes down, that people freak out like other services because you never really know, you know, as a user, what&#8217;s connected behind the scenes. So if there&#8217;s a GitHub outage for some reason, then all of a sudden that&#8217;s affecting other websites and other tools that you use. It sort of is all like chained together in some way. So I&#8217;m glad you mentioned that about availability. I&#8217;m just remembering from my time being at Glitch how whenever the tool went down, it was always a very frantic time at the company because it&#8217;s like, &#8220;oh, no, the tool&#8217;s down. We&#8217;re hearing about it from people. How do we fix it? How do we get things back up?&#8221; And that&#8217;s I feel like especially now, because so many things are connected under just a handful of services like GitHub, AWS, et cetera.</p>
<p>When things happen there, it&#8217;s a ripple effect throughout the web about other things that get affected. So I&#8217;m glad you mentioned availability as being a big thing that you work.</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>You know, GitHub, I mean, again, it&#8217;s a great platform. It&#8217;s been around for a long time, but it is a tool that runs on servers, right? There are data centers, that where GitHub is hosted. There are cloud providers. I mean, it is like any other system made by humans, and that means that you sometimes run into errors. And so while we work at this, like any other service, things happen. There could be a variety of reasons why something goes down. And one of the cool things about GitHub is that if there is an incident, right, where, hey, things are running slow, the system is not available. Again, we want this to be a very rare occurrence, but hey, it happens.</p>
<p>I can hop into a channel on Slack and just follow along what&#8217;s happening. We very much value transparency. And one of the super cool things about GitHub is that those incidents, again, we want them to be rare, are observable to anyone who&#8217;s a Hubber, right? We call ourselves Hubbers if you work at GitHub. And so that kind of transparency is a powerful feature of the company and really speaks to how we do want to embrace the open source model. And again, there are limits, to be honest, and there are reasonable limits, but for the most part, everything should be transparent, everything should be visible. And that&#8217;s really an open source principle that we hold very dearly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, you mentioned Copilot, and Copilot is like this tool that is used to sort of, I guess, help you code. Like it helps with suggestions, with code and things like that. Is that something that&#8217;s used internally or is that more of just like a customer facing product?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>Oh, absolutely. It&#8217;s an internal tool to give maybe a couple of examples of Copilot. Copilot integrates with popular IDEs like VS Code. And so once you have Copilot installed, you can say &#8220;hey Copilot, create a component&#8221; or &#8220;hey Copilot, add test.&#8221; So you can literally with your voice work with Copilot or you can add a comment to your code and describe what you&#8217;re doing. And then Copilot will put in. I mean, often, if not the scaffolding for what you&#8217;re trying to do, it&#8217;ll actually give you a solution, right? And so what Copilot is meant to do is to, like I said before, remove a lot of those friction points in the experience that developers go through. And instead of having to hop on Stack Overflow or Google a solution, all that&#8217;s built into the IDE, the development environment that you&#8217;re using. </p>
<p>But it&#8217;s smarter than Stack Overflow, right? It&#8217;s smarter than just doing random Google searches. It understands context and it&#8217;s able to understand, based on what you&#8217;re typing, what you want to do. So again, the analogy that I tend to use is imagine that you&#8217;re sitting next to the smallest developer that you&#8217;ve ever known and then they&#8217;re pair programming with you, right? You have your hand on your keyboard, you have your hand on the mouse, but they&#8217;re saying, &#8220;oh, try this.&#8221; Or it&#8217;s almost like that super smart pet programmer could immediately just paste code snippets into your IDE to help you along. Now, again, it&#8217;s not going to replace the human, right? It is very much meant to be something that instead of replacing human developers, it&#8217;s meant to be something that works with human developers.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the power of Copilot. I know that a lot of people are wondering, will AI replace developers? Will AI make software engineering a non viable career option for people? And I think that&#8217;s not happening at all. And I mean, that may happen, but it won&#8217;t be while I&#8217;m alive. Copilot and I think AI in general is really meant to be what can humans and AI do together and not what can AI replace what humans are doing right now?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the tool is called Copilot, not autopilot. So clearly&#8230;.</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s meant to be used sort of in conjunction with what humans are doing. I mean, the AI is not necessarily running itself in terms of prompts and things like that. You still have to have a person that&#8217;s sort of checking that. So it sounds like what Copilot kind of helps you do is just evolve your development in terms of, I would imagine productivity, like helping you out with maybe code snippets or things like that. I mean, I&#8217;m not a developer. I have done some front-end development. Like back in the day, you don&#8217;t remember everything, so you do end up looking stuff up. And that&#8217;s not to say that a great developer never has to look those things up, but at least what it sounds like Copilot does is it helps put those resources a bit closer to you to make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, the analogy that I use, this used to be a revolutionary thing, but like spell check and grammar check, right? We all use word processors, whether it&#8217;s Microsoft Word, Google Docs, where if you mistype a word, it&#8217;ll put a little red squiggly line under the word, or if you do something that&#8217;s maybe like where the grammar is off, it&#8217;ll highlight that. You can click it, it&#8217;ll give you a suggestion. Oh, the spelling, try this spelling or try this grammatical construction. And that hasn&#8217;t replaced editors. That hasn&#8217;t replaced writers, right? People still have jobs as editors, as copywriters, all that stuff, but it just makes everyone&#8217;s work a little bit more correct when it comes to spelling or to grammar. So it doesn&#8217;t replace the need for people to actually write stuff, but it does harmonize and make everyone&#8217;s writing a little bit better. And I think that just like spell check and grammar check have done for writing and we&#8217;ve used these for years and they haven&#8217;t destroyed entire careers. Copilot as an AI prep programming tool, it&#8217;s just that it makes your work a little bit faster.</p>
<p>It removes really a lot of the friction of you having to go over to a web browser and go to Stack Overflow or to Google &#8220;how do I do this region&#8221; and &#8220;how do I do this? What&#8217;s the format for this again?&#8221; And so by doing that, you really increase the speed of development by removing friction. And I think that&#8217;s one of the most beautiful things about Copilot.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&#8217;s just like I&#8217;m glad you mentioned that spell check kind of analogy because when ChatGPT really came about and a lot of educators are really concerned about whether or not, oh, is this going to replace students writing and things like that. The language model is trained off of a lot of different data, but just because it&#8217;s trained off that data doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re getting a perfect output. I&#8217;ve used ChatGPT before and yeah, it gives you information. Whether or not that information is wholly correct is up to the human to discern. Now you can take it just like on its face, like, yes, this is exactly what it is because AI told me that&#8217;s the case. But you don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s actually cognizant code that you&#8217;re actually using. If you&#8217;re using like Copilot or something like that, you still have to really sort of do that human check to make sure this is something that actually works. Just because the AI gave that to you doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that it&#8217;s something that might work for the particular project that you&#8217;re on or anything like that.</p>
<p>So I see what you&#8217;re saying about that human element is never going to go away because just because the AI can give you the information that you need, you still need to check to make sure it works for your particular situation.</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s kind know pivot here a little bit. We&#8217;ve talked a lot about your work at GitHub, so let&#8217;s learn more about you. Of course, you&#8217;ve mentioned your family, which we&#8217;ll talk about a bit later, but tell me more about you. I know you&#8217;re in Houston right now. Is that where you&#8217;re from originally?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>No, I am from a small city called Wichita Falls, Texas; not Wichita, Kansas, which people often confuse the two. And that&#8217;s where I grew up. That&#8217;s where I went to middle school. That&#8217;s where I went to high school. After graduating from UT Austin, I moved to Houston in 1997, and I&#8217;ve been in Houston ever since. That&#8217;s again, over like 25 years. So I am a Houstonian now. So I&#8217;m a Houstonian by tenure, not by birth.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s like me with Atlanta. Like, you mentioned that when we started recording, you&#8217;re like, &#8220;you&#8217;ve been in Atlanta for a long time?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;yeah, I&#8217;ve been here since &#8217;99.&#8221; I came for college. And I&#8217;m like, yeah, Atlantan by tenure, certainly not by birth. And I&#8217;ve seen how the city has changed so much since I first came here. So I get exactly what you&#8217;re saying.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go back to your time at Austin. You you majored in electrical engineering. Were you first interested in tech once you got to UT Austin? Or did you kind of have this sort of want to work in know prior to that?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to tell you a story about why representation matters. So when I was in junior high, there was a show called Star Trek I&#8217;m sure most people have heard about. I find that most people like Star Wars now for these days, like whenever I mentioned science fiction, they typically say, Star Wars, that&#8217;s Star Trek. But that&#8217;s another podcast. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a nerd all my life. I was into anime way before it was cool. I&#8217;m talking like 1995 Fist of the North Star, Akira anime. I&#8217;m OG Japanimation right here. And so I was into sci-fi. I read Tolkien and The Lord of the Rings way before the movie. So that was me. I played Dungeons &#038; Dragons. I was that Black kid with the weird people in the corner playing Dungeons &#038; Dragons. So that was my vibe circa like, 1985, just to be honest with you.</p>
<p>But Star Trek, you had the initial series of like, Kirk and Spock and all that. But then around my junior high school years, there was Star Trek: The Next Generation, and you had Captain Picard, who was obviously the captain of the Enterprise, but LeVar Burton played Georgdi LaForge. And the first season, he wasn&#8217;t in this position. But he became the chief engineer of the Enterprise for basically seasons two through seven. And so he was the key person in charge of all the technology on the Enterprise during this time. And so I&#8217;m in junior high then, going to high school while the seasons are going, and this wasn&#8217;t the only reason, but seeing LeVar Burton, a Black man, play a Black engineer in charge of this amazing technology was inspirational, right? Representation matters. And that very much was, like, part of the impetus for me seeing myself as an engineer.</p>
<p>And I was always good at Math and science. I was that kid that loved trigonometry, I loved calculus. I loved physics. And so that was what really helped guide my path to UT. And taking electrical engineering with all the circuit analysis and the math, like differential equations and vector calculus, that helped me see that that was possible. And so I became an engineer. And while I never served on the starship, I&#8217;ve loved working in technology for my entire career, and that was a big part of my story. LeVar Burton and seeing a Black man running tech in sci-fi.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, you ended up going to UT Austin kind of, and we sort of touched on this a little bit before, like, right around those prime A Different World years. I think A Different World ended in, what, ninety&#8230;&#8217;92?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>I think it ended&#8230;that sounds about right, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And you started at UT Austin in, what, &#8217;93?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>I started in 1993. You got it right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Tell me what your time was like there.</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, just to kind of put another finer point on that, I grew up with Dwayne, Whitley Gilbert, the whole gang on A Different World. And again, representation matters. I mean, I was a nerd, but I was also a lover of Black culture, right? I was a blerd &#8212; I think we call ourselves blerds now: Black nerds. And yeah, I mean, again, another area of representation was seeing these amazing Black people who were casted on the show about Black kids in college. And that really helped me further solidify that I wanted to be a Black kid in college and have that experience. </p>
<p>And so, yeah, I got to UT in 1993. I actually did a summer program called Preview. This was a program designed to give Black students who, for a variety of reasons, would sometimes struggle with the leap from high school to college. In many ways, they may have been the first people in their families to go to college. And there&#8217;s all these things about UT. I mean, I always tell people the year that my mother was born, in 1947, UT did not admit Black students. Right? So she was born into a world where Black students could not go to UT, right? So this is not ancient history. This is, like, within living memory, where Black people could not go to UT. And so Preview was meant to be a six week program. So before classes started freshman year, in that, like, September, we got to UT in July. We lived in dorms, we had events, we learned about college life, and that was an amazing program. And I will always owe a greater gratitude to the people who came up with Preview. </p>
<p>So after Preview, yeah, I started my time going to classes. I had a very hard degree, so I spent a lot of time studying. But UT is a huge campus. We&#8217;re talking 50,000 students, but when Black people are like, maybe roughly six or seven percent of 50,000, that&#8217;s a lot of Black people. And so I was able to find Black people who I could fellowship with. There&#8217;s a lounge in Jester West, which is like the kind of the main dorm on campus called the Malcolm X Lounge, right? Which was called the Malcolm X Lounge back then; I think still called that now. And that was a place where Black people went. We went there to play dominoes, play spades. If you were willing to risk your life, we would play Taboo, which can be a very&#8230;I&#8217;ve seen some people almost get into a funeral for Taboo, but I very much was able to marry my academic experience and grow as a college student with the very rigorous courses that I took as an engineering student. I was able to marry that with the Black experience. I mean, I went to a Black church that I found in Austin called St. James, and so my active experience at UT was really quite special, quite amazing, because I think we were at a time where that generation of Black students who saw A Different World in high school came together, and it was just really amazing. </p>
<p>Now, I will say that this was also the time when affirmative action was being challenged in Texas, right? There was something called the Hopwood decision, and I was the person who, before that decision was handed down, would protest. I mean, the newspaper of UT is called the Daily Texan, and there are letters that I wrote. You can write letters to the editor. Just anyone can write them if you&#8217;re a student. I wrote letters that you could find online to the Daily Texan about affirmative action and about Hopwood and why that decision was really wrong and would cause harm. And I took part in marches and protests about it. </p>
<p>So my college career also involved not only growing as a Black person and enjoying the Black experience, it was my first experience engaging in Black protest and really advocating for Black people as a Black person. So that was all wrapped around my experience at UT.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow. I mean, it sounds like your whole time there was really transformative.</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. Totally.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, after you graduated, you ended up working for Accenture, and you were at Accenture for a long time. You were there for a little over ten years. Tell me about that, because I think for people graduating from college now, working any place for ten years after that almost feels like a fairy tale. What was your time like there? And what made you want to go to Accenture?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>I should also mention that my wife, my now wife was going to &#8212; if she hears this &#8212; I met my wife at UT, right? That&#8217;s a big part of our story. We did not get married in college because we were young, but that came later. But to answer your question, so when I was in my junior year, my senior year at UT, you&#8217;re going into the job search field. And one of the things that I learned about myself at UT is I love technology. I love the ones and zeros, I love code, I love software and all those things are true. But I also really like people. Maurice, I&#8217;m not sure we&#8217;re talking about my public speaking career; so I&#8217;ve spoken on stages all around the world. In fact, I&#8217;m going to be in Copenhagen, Denmark next week to give a talk, right? So I very much engage hundreds of people on stage. I am not bothered by that at all. But I&#8217;m a classical introvert. I am a classical introvert. Most people don&#8217;t believe me because I&#8217;m a manager. I live with people all day long, I speak in front of huge crowds, but I&#8217;m a very big introvert. So I went to UT as that kind of shy, introverted kid. But being involved in what I just described, the Black experience, that really drew me UT of my shell. And I realized that I really like people.</p>
<p>I felt that one of the biggest things that I like about people is helping people. And so when I was looking at jobs to do, there were like the regular software companies, the people that made circuits like Intel and AMD, and then there were software companies that I was looking at and I got offers from those places. But one of the things I loved about Anderson Consulting &#8212; which was the name of Accenture before the name change happened &#8212; one thing I liked about the consulting model is that you could dive deep into the technology, but you could also dive into the people as well. Because Anderson Consulting very much was hiring engineers, not just business majors, but engineers to join their technology practice because they felt that you really get beauty when you can marry technology and people. </p>
<p>And so my transformation from this shy, introverted kid when I first went to UT, becoming someone who really likes people very much, informed my desire to go into consulting and to go to Accenture. And then one of the things that I really learned to talk a little bit about my early years there was all around consulting is a great way to learn a lot of things very quickly. I learned in the first two years of Accenture things I probably would have taken me three or four years to learn somewhere else because you&#8217;re donating these huge projects, you&#8217;re learning how to work with clients, right? People who are paying you to be there to communicate the value of the project, to guide the project. And that was really my first few years of working at Accenture.</p>
<p>I learned how to be a better software developer. I learned how to work on teams, I learned how to be managed by a manager. And that was really very much the early part of my Accenture experience. I was in the Houston office, and there was a very vibrant Black community of Black people who worked at Accenture Anderson at that time. And that also furthered the connections that I made with my fellow Black people in tech. And some of the people I went to UT with went to Accenture as well. And so my experience at Accenture was almost in many ways, like the next version of what I went through in college, right. Deepening my technology bonafides and also deepening my identity as a Black person and being in the Black culture, right? All those things really work together, and I was there for a long time.</p>
<p>I mean, let me pause here and say, if you want to know more, that&#8217;s kind of the first, let&#8217;s say zero to five years of my time at Accenture.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What were the other five like?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>That first five years was learning to be really to be an employee at a large company. I eventually became a manager where I was not being managed; I was managing teams. And so that&#8217;s a whole &#8216;nother level of responsibility. One thing I should mention, and I mentioned that I met my wife at UT, is that I got married around year five. I guess around when I made a manager, I became a manager. That point. My wife and I, who had honestly lost touch a little bit after college, we reconnected, we got married. And so it was learning how to be married, which is a thing, to be honest. I&#8217;m still learning how to be married 21 years in, Maurice.</p>
<p>I was learning how to be married, learning how to be a manager, and shepherding people&#8217;s careers, learning how to be a technologist. And so that last five year period was all that. But the reason that my time in Accenture lasted that long is that I was learning, and I was learning new things about myself all the time. I was learning new things about technology because the technology field is always changing. I was growing, but I was also traveling a lot. And so my new wife, who we eventually became a wife and my first born child, and then we got to child two. My wife was saying, &#8220;you travel too much.&#8221; When they&#8217;re babies, it&#8217;s not like that big of a deal. But when they begin to know who you are and they begin to miss you when you&#8217;re gone when Daddy has to go away Monday morning to fly wherever and then come back Friday night, I began to see that, wow, this travel thing is really becoming tough on my very young family. And so I began to think about what to do, right? Should I leave Accenture, go work for maybe a company where I don&#8217;t have to travel as much or do I do something else? </p>
<p>And so my wife and I talked about it and we made a family decision that I would leave Accenture and get my MBA. So I went to get my MBA. So that was like a two year period that let me get off the road, it let me also get a credential that would help my career. Those were a lot of the bigger decisions about why I left Accenture at around a kind of ten year mark and earned my business degree.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So I&#8217;m glad that you mentioned that sort of you leading up to getting your MBA, it sounds like each of these experiences just kind of like built upon each other. So it wasn&#8217;t oh, I felt like I was maybe edged out at work, so I needed to get more education. Everything is kind of built upon each other. In terms of your career up to this point, I&#8217;m curious because you sort of alluded to this a bit beforehand. Was this your plan to kind of structure your career in this way?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>I wish I could say it was a plan, Maurice, but no, I fell into&#8230;I mean, there are these things in this part of my life, right, growing as a technologist, growing as a Black person, and yes, very much going from UT to Accenture to my MBA were growing those things as well. Because a big part, like I said about Accenture, is you marry technology and people. And I would also say when you marry technology and business, that&#8217;s powerful, right? So my undergraduate degree in double E [electrical engineering], right, that kind of engineering undergrad was kind of getting the technology part in place and working for a technology practice in a big company. My technology credentials are very strong. I also wanted my business side to get stronger as well. So the MBA was a very nice kind of pair to that.</p>
<p>And so these tracks of technology and business and Blackness, I would say, they all kind of built along very well, but it wasn&#8217;t planned. I mean, I was, I think, a very smart person married to a smart person, kind of trying to figure this stuff out. But I have to admit, luck played a factor, right? I was able to stay at Accenture when we had a few rounds of layoffs during my time there. The economy took a nosedive, right? I joined in 1997. A lot of people &#8212; if you&#8217;re old enough to remember 2000, 2001 &#8212; was kind of the dotcom crash. I survived that, kept working. And so luck went my way and I was able to have these themes progress by avoiding a lot of the disruptions that a lot of people go through. I mean, I was thinking through this. Yeah, sure, absolutely. So, yes, I was a smart person, I think, making smart decisions, and I was lucky to be able to, like I said before, be married to a smart person. My wife is brilliant, who was my partner in navigating this part of my life. But I want the people here in this to know one of the biggest things that are so important in your career and in life is luck.</p>
<p>And I think that you can&#8217;t plan luck, you can&#8217;t schedule luck to appear, but what you can do is do your best to be prepared for when luck appears. And I think that I was very much, if anything, always prepared for luck to enter the chat in my life and then use that luck as the stepping stone to the next opportunity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And now, since then, you&#8217;ve been pretty much working nonstop. Like looking at your LinkedIn, you&#8217;ve mostly worked as a technical program manager, in sort of the pre-GitHub years. What lessons did you learn from those experiences that prepared you for what you do now?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>Oh, so many experiences and so many lessons. What I would say is that, and I should say I did go back to consulting briefly at Deloitte after my business degree because I graduated in 2008. And the people again, if you want to remember, there was a big recession in 2008 &#8212; right? &#8212; that lasted through 2009. And so I got a couple of offers when I was studying, when I was applying for jobs, when my business school time was coming to an end. But the best offers, to be honest, came from big consulting companies because I had Accenture on my resume. And so I went back briefly, but soon after that I left the kind of big company model and I&#8217;ve worked at startups. So look at my resume. You see these names that weren&#8217;t nearly as recognizable as Accenture and Deloitte. You see Assemble. You see Allcenter Software. They&#8217;re all technology companies, but they were really startups. </p>
<p>And what I wanted to do and again, this was not entirely planned, but what I wanted to do is experience the startup life because I had friends and colleagues who went to startups, like way before I did, and I wanted to see what could I do in an environment where I didn&#8217;t have massive resources, right? When you work for Deloitte and Accenture, you have billions of dollars backing the company. You have a massive number of resources, but when you go to a startup, it&#8217;s scrappy, right? Everyone wears a lot of hats. I&#8217;m having to lead the technology team, but I&#8217;m also having to understand the business. I need to support the product, I need to support HR, I need to support recruiting. And these functions existed at the bigger companies, but they were way smaller at these startup companies.</p>
<p>And so that helped me to understand and really put my business degree to use because I was never going to be able to peer deeply into recruiting at Accenture, but I could at a startup. I could know the person running that function, I could really understand their day to day. I could understand how my technology function really interacted with their non-technology function and see how we can harmonize those things together. And so I would say that the lessons that I learned were all around, really, how do these functions interact with each other. And I also learned how to lead teams better, right? Because at Accenture, and the way as a manager, like, there&#8217;s massive resources. When I became a manager at Accenture, I went to something called New Manager School in Chicago, right? So they flew people to Chicago from Houston &#8212; really all over the world &#8212; to learn how to be a manager, right? I didn&#8217;t have that at the startup. It was like, &#8220;you better&#8230;here&#8217;s your log on, good luck.&#8221; And so I had to learn how to be a manager at that scale.</p>
<p>And I think that that deepened what I bring to management today, and that is people over process, people over technology. If the people are right, everything else really doesn&#8217;t really matter, right? Because if you treat the people right, any technology, any process will do. However, if you don&#8217;t treat people right, then no technology or process will save you. And that is a core part of my management style. And it was really birthed in that sort of experience where I had to deeply integrate with this team. Because at Accenture, I&#8217;m leading teams, but I&#8217;m working on projects that have a beginning and an end. So I have a team for maybe four months and my next team might be six months and my next team might be a month. And then we&#8217;re changing technology stacks, we&#8217;re changing the business problems that we&#8217;re solving, right? It&#8217;s all changing. But at these startups, I&#8217;m with the same group of people, the same stack, the same product, the same customer base for a very long period of time. And so those lessons were all around how to be really a people manager. </p>
<p>And I think that I&#8217;ve gotten feedback from multiple people &#8212; people who&#8217;ve worked for me, people who are peers, people who I reported to &#8212; that my people management skills are very strong and those skills were very much honed and sharpened in the startup world. So that&#8217;s a big lesson that I learned during that time. One of the other lessons that I learned is you got to manage up, right? I mean, when I started my career, I was thinking, &#8220;well, if the work&#8217;s good, then people go and notice, right?&#8221; I thought the work speaks for itself. No, work doesn&#8217;t have a mouth. It doesn&#8217;t speak.</p>
<p>You have to speak for the work. You have to make sure whether that&#8217;s in your status report, that&#8217;s in how you communicate to your supervisors, and that&#8217;s how you really take advantage of opportunities to be in front of leadership. You have to market the work. And so marketing the work as an engineering leader was a huge lesson that we can go into more, maybe later, but it&#8217;s very important that technology leaders are proficient in technology, in process, in people management. But you have to market the work, because if you don&#8217;t do that, the work is going to be invisible. And invisible work does not get rewarded; invisible work does not get promoted.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow. That, I think, is something that&#8217;s super important for people to know, I think, in general. And I mean, one&#8230;that&#8217;s true, closed mouths don&#8217;t get fed, right? But also, just in terms of how much is out there, in terms of social media and user-generated content and things like that, you might hope that the work will speak for you, but it can easily, very easily get drowned out by other things. So I like that you&#8217;re saying that, especially for engineering, because I&#8217;ve been a creative on marketing teams at very tech heavy software companies, like tech startups and stuff. And yeah, getting the engineers to talk about any of the work they do is like pulling teeth. They don&#8217;t want to talk about it. They feel like, &#8220;oh, it&#8217;s enough that I just did it.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;no, we&#8217;re trying to build stories around the work that you&#8217;re doing so people know that you did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Otherwise, people &#8212; I mean, that&#8217;s not to say that people have a negative opinion of tech; I think certainly people&#8217;s opinions around technology and the tech industry have kind of changed a lot over the years &#8212; but certainly being able to speak about the work that you&#8217;ve done and to promote it is something that is super important. That&#8217;s for developers, designers, whoever.</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>Exactly. And I really think that goes back to what we talked about with my experience going to UT as an introvert, this shy quiet kid, and learning what you just said. Closed mouths don&#8217;t get fed, no matter how good looking you may be as a, you know, the ladies like the Hollywood dude who has game, right? I mean, it&#8217;s just little things like that. And so, yes, all those things kind of continue through UT, through Accenture, through business school&#8230;you got to market yourself. So many opportunities that I&#8217;ve received is because I did interesting things in public all along this timeline that we&#8217;ve been walking. Twitter came on, Black Twitter came on, right? And by doing interesting things on Twitter, interesting things on social media, I got speaking opportunities, I&#8217;ve gotten job offers through just being interesting in public, right? Marketing yourself. </p>
<p>And I think a lot of engineers &#8212; I mean, very much this has been my experience working with a lot of engineers &#8212; we very much skew introvert. We very much skew quiet, usually very intelligent, but also very quiet. And you&#8217;re exactly right, pulling things out of introverted engineers. And again, I don&#8217;t want to stereotype, but it&#8217;s an archetype that I&#8217;ve seen, and that for whatever makes an engineer engineer, often what comes with it is just this kind of maybe quiet nature. And so I realized that that would hold me back, that in my career, being quiet would not redound to my benefit. And I needed to learn to speak and present not only my work, but the work of my team. And that, honestly, has been a big accelerator to my career in technology.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What still keeps you interested in tech? I mean, you&#8217;ve been doing this now, like you said, for over 25 years. What still drives you?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a blessing and a curse. And that is technology is always changing. We didn&#8217;t have Copilot, we didn&#8217;t have Kubernetes, we didn&#8217;t have all these tools. When I started my career over 25 years ago, the tools that I had back then would be considered like rocks and sticks today, for the most part, right? It&#8217;s very primitive. I mean, not all of them, right? I mean, a lot of those languages still exist, but there&#8217;s so much I don&#8217;t know. There&#8217;re like so much&#8230;just sophistication, I guess, is what I&#8217;m looking for, in the tools that we have now.</p>
<p>And so that ever-changing landscape where you have to stay on your toes, the cutting edge, the state-of-the-art is always moving. That can be stressful because you have to keep upgrading yourself. You have to really re-invent yourself at least every two to three years in software development because things change that quickly. And so that can be stressful. It&#8217;s so compelling because there&#8217;s so many cool things that would be hard to do now using the tools I had when I started my career. I mean, spinning up a development environment with a click; all the tools that we have right now, they&#8217;re like higher order languages now that really didn&#8217;t exist now. I mean, I learned COBOL and C and all these things early in my career, and those languages are still used today, but there are so many more human-friendly languages like Python and other languages that, I mean, Ruby is a very human-compatible language, right? And so there&#8217;s so much power in the accessibility to get into technology now that I&#8217;ve seen grow over my time.</p>
<p>And so that evolution and watching it, that keeps me interested. That&#8217;s one big thing; it&#8217;s just the ever evolving nature of technology. And to be honest, I like people, right? I love helping people find capabilities and potential that they may not have found if I didn&#8217;t work with them, right? And I&#8217;ve seen in people that I&#8217;ve managed over the years, I&#8217;ve helped to help debug imposter syndrome. I&#8217;ve helped to support, I&#8217;ve helped to mentor, I&#8217;ve helped to sponsor people and then be able to be that force for what I hope is good is also compelling, right? So those are two things that have kept me intact and they add a bit of a bounce to my stuff every day when I walk into my office.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, I mentioned before how people&#8217;s kind of opinion about tech has sort of changed over the years. For developers that are listening,I&#8217;m pretty sure they might want to know the answer to this question. But what opportunities do you see out there now for developers? Are there certain skills they need to be learning to stay competitive? I feel like you&#8217;re like the sage on top of the mountain. From your perspective, where do you see the opportunities for devs now?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>The opportunity for devs is like&#8230;it has, I don&#8217;t think ever been stronger because of a couple of things. One, there are so many engineers that I&#8217;ve worked for and work with, right? So as people who were like VPs, or people who reported to me, who did not have the traditional computer science background, engineering background, the same background that I came from, but who were so talented, so brilliant, some of the smartest people who became my right hand as tech leads did not study computer science, right? I&#8217;ve had people who were speech pathologists, I&#8217;ve had people who worked in retail, worked in bookstores, but they went to a boot camp, they learned how to code, they were great at it, and they became developers. So I think one of the biggest opportunities &#8212; and I said it&#8217;s the people of color who I think are the primary audience for this podcast and the people who have very much been instrumental in my career &#8212; because we often don&#8217;t have either the funds or the opportunities to go get computer science degrees from the MITs and the Stanfords of the world. And I&#8217;m here to tell you that that&#8217;s not really required. You can even be like a self-taught programmer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve even had people who taught themselves how to code, right? So I would say that the barrier to entry to get in software development has never been lower. There are all kinds of opportunities for people to come into this field and there are people like me who are waiting for you, who are here to welcome you, who are here to support you if you&#8217;re willing to come in. And so I would say that these tools are so powerful and the things you need to know to be successful in software development oriented technology in general have never been more available, have never been as powerful. So I would say that&#8217;s one thing that you should know. The opportunity is so strong, I hope people feel that they can do it. Because if you&#8217;re hearing my voice right now, then you can.</p>
<p>I would say the other thing that is a key part of the opportunity is, yes, there are technical aspects of the trade. Yes, there are things that you&#8217;re going to have to learn. There are hard things that you&#8217;re going to have to learn. But the number one trait that will keep you in this field, that will help you get in the field and stay, is patience and curiosity. That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s not learning object oriented programming or learning highly typed versus not typed code languages or learning the difference between these different things or learning Kubernetes or all these things. But it&#8217;s being patient and being curious. If you have those things, if you&#8217;re willing to go through&#8230;often the thing like this thing isn&#8217;t compiling and I don&#8217;t know why. Let me figure out let me put in a debugger. Let me figure out how to get it working right. If you&#8217;re able to just think, &#8220;oh, I&#8217;ve always wanted to learn about this,&#8221; and then taking time to do that, those attributes would do so much for your career. So if you&#8217;re willing to be patient, if you&#8217;re willing to lead with curiosity, you can do well here. And I have to say that open source, right? GitHub very much loves open source. I run a program that&#8217;s designed, you know, GitHub sponsors for open source. You can learn so much through open source software where you can, with almost no financial outlay, join a project, learn how it works, make contributions. There are so many programs that are basically designed to help people get into open source, where you can upgrade your skills. You can work with teams. You can become a valued contributor to some of the most powerful software on the planet. </p>
<p>So those are the things that I would let people know about this field. The barrier to entry is lower than you think. If you&#8217;re willing to be patient, if you&#8217;re willing to be curious, if you&#8217;re willing to be involved in open source, and I can absolutely help you do that. Please reach out. Please come in. The industry needs you to be honest, and there are many people like me who are here to help.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now who have been some of the mentors or peers that have helped you out in your career? I mean, I feel like with everything you&#8217;ve mentioned, you&#8217;ve probably had a really strong community of support behind you.</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been super lucky. I mean&#8230;so I was a resident assistant at UT. I was an RA, that person who worked in the dorm, who had maybe the bigger room, who was there to tell you, &#8220;hey, turn your music down&#8221;, or&#8230;I&#8217;ve honestly walked in on people who drank too much, helped them stumble to the dorm even though they were underage, right? I was that person. UT, I remember when I applied for the RA job, right? I&#8217;m probably 19 years old, right. When I first became an RA, maybe 19, 20.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>And the person who interviewed me, I think they were the head of housing at UT. I remember her office. If I close my eyes, I can remember sitting in her office, and she said, &#8220;you know, everyone who talked to you liked you, but you seem a little bit quiet, right? You seem a little bit reserved.&#8221; This person was absolutely right. &#8220;We want to give you this opportunity, but you&#8217;re going to have to lean into the people part of this because as an RA, you are responsible for residents. Residents are people.&#8221; And that was amazing. I mean, that little bit of advice, getting that job helped propel this shy, introverted, nerdy kid into being someone who loves people, right? </p>
<p>And I remember &#8212; just kind of fast forwarding a little bit &#8212; like, one of the managers I worked for at a project at Accenture was very much, again, similar, started the speech like, &#8220;hey, we really like you. You&#8217;re doing good work. And if I walk over to the place where you&#8217;re working with your team, I can see it. But hey, you need to find ways to let other people know about what you&#8217;re doing.&#8221; And that goes back to the work that speaks for itself. Like, that manager very much was a mentor to me, and so I&#8217;ve had people all along the way give me nudges, give me advice, give me support for things that most people can recognize. If you&#8217;re involved in Twitter or in technology, Scott Hanselman has been an amazing mentor of mine, and a friend is a very well known person at Microsoft. Kelsey Hightower, who recently retired from Google, is an amazing person, amazing friend.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve mentored me without knowing it, just by having conversations. I&#8217;ve met them at speaking gigs, I&#8217;ve met them at different places, and I would say that they have been mentors to me. Neha Batra, who is a VP at GitHub, who&#8217;s very well known on the speaker circuit in fact, has been a mentor of mine. She really was one of the people who helped me get into GitHub. I&#8217;ve learned so much from her about being a better people manager. I mean, I thought I knew what I was doing when I joined GitHub, but she helped me navigate all the special sauce at GitHub, how to be an even better people manager, better technology leader. So I want to make sure people who you can find on Twitter, you know Scott Hanselman, Kelsey Hightower, Neha goes by nerdneha &#8212; I guess we&#8217;re calling it X now &#8212; on X now, and tons of people who you couldn&#8217;t find if you looked for them. But at Accenture, at UT, at Deloitte, at startups&#8230;they have been all instrumental in my growth and they all saw the potential in me and they saw where I needed a little bit of a nudge to kind of get to the next level.</p>
<p>They basically helped me receive that nudge. And so I really try to pay it forward. And a big part of what I do in my industry, whether that&#8217;s the people who report to me at GitHub or other people within the company, whether it&#8217;s being someone who is on the speaker circuit and I meet a lot of people out. When I&#8217;m on the road, I look for people who like, oh, that person needs a little bit of a nudge. And that same nudge that people gave to me, I try to give people that nudge and just help them see something that they need to do, give them a map for how to do it, and then supporting them as they find their way to higher success.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, you have three kids you&#8217;ve just mentioned at the top of the episode. First one is now in college, second one&#8217;s a senior in high school. Third one is a sophomore. Are they sort of interested in tech like you are? Like, do they want to follow in your footsteps?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>Maurice, I did my best, but you know, they&#8217;re into, you know, technology toys, the iPhones, the iPads, the Apple Watches and all. And you know, they play on their Xbox and their PS. But when it comes to a career in technology, like helping to design an iPhone, helping learning Swift to create apps on the iPhone, they all did computer science courses in high school. Like, they learned JavaScript and they learned even just regular Java and all that. But I think that my wife is just more awesome than me. And my wife was an MIS major from the business school at UT for undergrad, and they all want to do business work. So I&#8217;m like, &#8220;okay. All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hey. My wife is simply more compelling. And so my oldest son at UT is in the business school. My son, who&#8217;s a senior who you mentioned, is also looking for doing business. My daughter is kind of&#8230;she&#8217;s my only hope. She&#8217;s my last hope for maybe getting an engineer out of the family, but I think she&#8217;ll probably go to business as well. But, yes, I would say that I failed as a father to launch technologists, but I think that from my household will emerge some amazing business people. I&#8217;ll take solace in that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, you never know. I mean, I think if there&#8217;s one thing that people will kind of get from this interview, is that you can kind of take control and take charge of your career at any given point in time. So I think even just with this show in general, there&#8217;s no set path to get to where you want to go in terms of your end destination, based on what your values are, things like that. So there could still be time. Don&#8217;t count them out yet.</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s true. I should be more hopeful. So, yeah, you&#8217;re right. I&#8217;ll never give up on my kids and their future. So you&#8217;re exactly right. And you&#8217;re exactly right with your career. I mean, one thread that I&#8217;ve learned, that I wish I learned earlier, is that your career is not something that happens to you, right? You have agency, you have volition, and then you can take that next step, right? And so, yeah, there may be people who support you. Hopefully the people give you the safe nudges that I receive, but you also can study the game and learn how to play it better.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been lucky to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, where do you see yourself in the next five years? What kind of work do you want to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>That is something I&#8217;ve been thinking about a lot. So if you think about just the career ladder, right? So I&#8217;ve gone from individual contributor &#8212; or IC, as we say &#8212; to manager or eng manager, to senior eng manager, to staff eng manager. And so if you look at most ladders, the next level would be like director, VP, maybe going up to maybe above that. So I think that that&#8217;s probably where I want to go. I mean, like I said earlier, what&#8217;s kept me in this industry is the way that it&#8217;s always changing. There&#8217;s always new toys, always new tools, and then there&#8217;s also people, right? People to help and people that hopefully that I can impact in a positive way. And so I would say that&#8217;s probably from a career perspective, what I&#8217;m going to do with my professional career, which is go up that level. I&#8217;ve been honestly a little bit hesitant because I do think that the further I get away from the technology, from the people doing their work, the more I may be less motivated.</p>
<p>Because again, I love code, I love software, I love helping people build software. And as you go up toward VP, you&#8217;re really far away. I mean, the technology is like a speck on the horizon, and then you&#8217;re seeing politics and business and all that stuff. And while I can do that, I&#8217;ve been reluctant to do that. But that&#8217;s where you have impact, right? That&#8217;s where you can impact not just a team of maybe ten engineers, that&#8217;s where you can impact a department of hundreds. I think from a professional standpoint, that&#8217;s where I see myself going outside of work. I mean, I love public speaking. I have a lot of cool gigs booked for the rest of this year.</p>
<p>I think doing more of that, that&#8217;s really what I love doing. And I still love writing, a fair amount of technical writing that gets published. But if I could wave a magic wand and then kind of change the percentages, I would make work maybe a smaller percent of what I spend doing, and speaking or writing a bigger percentage of what I spend doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, your speaking, your writing and everything&#8230;where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>One of the things that is really lucky about having a fairly unique first name is that you can find me at Anjuan at a lot of places, right? That&#8217;s Anjuan. Anjuansimmons.com is my website. That&#8217;s kind of my home base. But you can find me on Twitter, or &#8212; sorry, X &#8212; or Threads or wherever you go. If you search for A-N-J-U-A-N you will probably find me and please reach out. You can follow me. You can connect with me again. I&#8217;ve grown into a person who loves people.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always happy to do what I can to help people become better versions of themselves because my entire career has been becoming a better version of the person that I am. And so please reach out. I would love to connect and continue this conversation on other platforms.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Sounds good. Anjuan Simmons, thank you so much for coming on the show. I mean, one, thank you for just sharing your story about how you&#8217;ve gotten to where you are, but also from talking about the work that you&#8217;re doing at GitHub. And like we sort of mentioned throughout this interview, the thing about your career is that you&#8217;ve really kind of owned it, you know what I&#8217;m saying? At any place where you&#8217;ve been, whether it&#8217;s been just getting out of college or getting your MBA and then going to what the next step is, it sounds like you&#8217;ve really owned your career, like, every step of the way. And I hope that that&#8217;s something that when people listen back to this, they&#8217;ll get that they can do that for themselves as well.</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. Like I said, there was a fair amount of luck, but there was also a lot of intentionality. If you listen to this, you can be more intentional in your career. I hope that what you&#8217;ve gotten from this interview that that&#8217;s very much possible. Let me give you your flowers. Maurice, I want to tell you before I leave, Revision Path matters. It&#8217;s important. You&#8217;ve done an amazing job.</p>
<p>Please keep doing it. You touch lives in ways that you will probably never, ever know. So I love what you&#8217;re doing here. Please keep doing it. And I love being here. Thank you so much for giving me space on this podcast.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, well, thank you. First of all, thank you so much for that, and thank you for being here. I really appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Anjuan Simmons:</b></p>
<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>Branden Collins, founder of the design studio <a href="https://theyoungneversleep.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The Young Never Sleep</a>, is a deep thinker. I had such a blast during our conversation about the complex and thought-provoking world of tech, creativity, and the endless possibilities they hold. As an interdisciplinary designer, Branden has worked at Cartoon Network and Snap, but he&#8217;s also been heads down in the Atlanta creative community as well, which he&#8217;s just returning to after a stint in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>We talked about the ever-evolving landscape of social media, including the rise of microblogging platforms (as a response to Twitter&#8217;s X-ification), the cautiousness in navigating the digital realm, and some potential ethical issues surrounding AI and VR. Branden also shared his philosophy of technoculture, and we explored world building, information science, issues sex workers face in online platforms, and the parallels between past technological shifts and the emergence of the metaverse.</p>
<p>This episode will definitely make you think twice about the tech we build, how we use it, and how it affects our world!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>I am Branden Collins. I am an interdisciplinary queer designer, artist, inventor, archivist and performer from Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice. How has 2023 been going for you?</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been pretty good. I moved back from Atlanta&#8230;to Atlanta from Los Angeles. It&#8217;ll be about two years ago now. So over the course of those couple of years, I&#8217;ve just been kind of adjusting to being back here, being around old friends and reconnecting with people and sort of trying to re-establish myself in my practice here, which has been a journey. But I&#8217;ve been able to kind of kickstart a lot of new projects that I&#8217;m really, really excited about. So it&#8217;s been a whirlwind, but it&#8217;s been overall positive and really nurturing, nourishing experience so far. The year has been pretty good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice. What&#8217;s been like the biggest thing you&#8217;ve had to adjust to?</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Not being close to the ocean, I think that&#8217;s definitely the biggest thing for sure. Everything else comes with being in Atlanta versus L.A. Just typical stuff, but that&#8217;s definitely been the biggest adjustment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, the traffic in Atlanta is pretty bad too, but the traffic in L.A. is on par, I feel.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s a toss up. You&#8217;d be hard pressed to say which one is worse, to be honest. The infrastructure in Atlanta definitely isn&#8217;t built for as many cars as we have coming into the city. And even in L.A., I think a city that was built for that is still a challenge. So being here is definitely pretty hardcore.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, you talked about re-establishing yourself and working with some projects. Can you talk about what some of those are? Is there anything that you want to try to do before the year ends?</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>So yeah, a few things. </p>
<p>I am working with a longtime collaborator and friend, Ami Swecki, who runs a creative studio called Zoo as Zoo. Her and I are working to build a platform called YOO, which is essentially at this stage, like a mind-mapping tool to help people of all kinds, but specifically new media, artists and creative technologists, to help them just organize their digital life, so to speak, all in one place. And sort of, in that way, help them sort of make new connections and curate their ideas towards the development of new projects and new types of technology. So that&#8217;s one of the bigger things that I&#8217;m working on. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m opening a bar with a good friend of mine, longtime friend Omar Ferrer. It&#8217;s called El Malo, and it&#8217;s going to be a really beautiful place and definitely a practice in world building for him and I and the whole team, which I&#8217;m working on Zoo with that as well. Really excited about that; about having our own space to have fun and enjoy. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on XR radio with Amiko &#8212; Sharon Oh &#8212; who runs her own studio, Polyvisuals. We&#8217;re essentially just trying to craft a story, a narrative about mixed reality and about identity and kind of through the lens of all of these technologies that all of us are sort of keeping our finger on the pulse about artificial intelligence and AR and VR and simulation and all these different things. Kind of asking the question, like, &#8220;what does it look like to exist in a world where all these technologies are integrated with one another&#8221; and having to navigate that? Sort of the way that we&#8217;re approaching it, as with all of my work, is really from an anthropological perspective, and I think recognizing that the tools themselves &#8212; the channels are new, the devices are new &#8212; but the questions and the challenges aren&#8217;t really that new. When you think about how we all navigate the world with the identities that have been in large part bestowed upon us, we have to constantly encounter manipulation and questionable realities and alternative facts and all of these things. We&#8217;ve had to do that for a really long time. It&#8217;s interesting to try to kind of craft a story around that with those things in mind. </p>
<p>So those are some of the kind of the big ones that I&#8217;m working on and everything kind of like circles around all of the rest of my work, which we&#8217;ll talk about more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. So, yeah, you&#8217;re doing just a few light projects, nothing major.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. (laughs)</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I heard about El Malo. I think I heard about it&#8230;I want to say maybe on it was one of these blogs. It might have been Water or What&#8217;s New Atlanta&#8230;Tomorrow News Atlanta? Something like that. But I think it&#8217;s going to be in Reynoldstown, I think.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s at the Dairies. Yeah, it&#8217;s right in that little &#8212; not little &#8212; in that complex next to the Eastern. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I definitely want to check it out because I heard it&#8217;s a rum bar and I love rum.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Nice. Okay. Yeah, we&#8217;d love to have you, man. I&#8217;ll give you a membership. We can just set it up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, thank you! Yeah, I appreciate that. Let&#8217;s talk about your studio, The Young Never Sleep, which you founded back in 2010. I&#8217;m looking at the website and it&#8217;s described as &#8220;a platform for visual experimentation through collaboration and interdisciplinary design services,&#8221; which you kind of have spoken about already a little bit with some of the stuff you&#8217;re working on. Tell me more about the studio.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, so I started that in 2010. It was originally just the name of my blog on Tumblr. I think I just came up with that. I think rooted in this idea of, just like, the restlessness that comes with youth and with being just insatiable in curiosity, and that being kind of the driving force behind my work. So the name kind of stuck as a blog and then turned into the name I use for my creative practice. And, yeah, I&#8217;ve been using it as a platform, a network, so to speak, to collaborate with other creatives to expand our work, the possibilities of our work, kind of leaning on each other&#8217;s strengths and then using it as a way to work with clients, with brands large and small. And over time, it&#8217;s just continued to evolve and expand as a way to explore my own identity and just do cultural research and archiving. And it&#8217;s kind of ballooned into a much, much larger idea, which is exciting. Sometimes overwhelming, but it feels right, so I&#8217;m still doing it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, what would you say kind of sets your studio apart from other studios?</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>I would kind of parallel it with what I appreciate a lot about Zoo. Zoo as Zoo &#8212; Ami&#8217;s studio &#8212; is, I think, we approach it slightly different ways sometimes, but I think we both understand, I think, the impact and significance of not just creativity, but creative thinking. And the way I approach it is, again, through the lens of, like, anthropology, science, nature, and this idea that creativity is something that&#8217;s inherent to nature. You know, start talking about technoculture. That&#8217;s essentially what that kind of practice and philosophy is about, is that these things are rooted in nature. </p>
<p>Like, when you look out at nature, animals express creativity. They do architecture. Animals have languages and dialects. Animals create technology. They make tools. They have tool use and do mathematics and experimentation. And it&#8217;s sort of like realigning ourselves with the fact that we are animals. We&#8217;re animals, too. And that&#8217;s like a thing to be an honor for us, that we&#8217;re a part of this grand story of technology that doesn&#8217;t just start with humankind. It actually just starts with the beginning of life itself, and that the creative endeavor is the same thing. It starts the story of creativity, and creative expression goes back as far as time itself. And that, to me, is a profound acknowledgment. It kind of drives the pursuit of the studio. </p>
<p>And I started using this banner &#8212; another world is possible &#8212; many years ago not knowing that it was an actual term in politics of alter-globalization which seeks to hold on to the positive aspects of globalization while sort of critiquing and, if necessary, discarding some of the negative aspects, which I found to be pretty perfect once I realized that that is what it actually was about. But it&#8217;s really rooted in a world building practice and this idea that when we look out at nature, nature has all of these incredibly innovative solutions to so many complex problems. Using that logic, it&#8217;s quite simple that the world that we live in, with all of its kind of multitudes of injustices, is just one world. It&#8217;s one possible outcome based on things that we all should know about. We know why we arrived to this destination, because our map was constructed in a certain way. So if we start to retell the story and start to change the map, then the histories and the futures that are available look totally different. </p>
<p>And that, to me, is exciting. And that&#8217;s sort of the power and potential of creativity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>As you&#8217;re talking about this, you&#8217;re reminding me of an interview I did several years ago with Billy Almon. Billy Almon, he&#8217;s an inventor also. He&#8217;s an astrobiofuturist. </p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yes. I love that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And a lot of the work he does is around biomimicry. Some of what he does kind of speaks to what you&#8217;re talking about in that looking to the natural world on ways that we as humans can kind of live in this world or solutions, things like that. His premise is that the natural world kind of has provided all the solutions that we need. If we just look for them or look to them, I should say 100%.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And also, your studio is a collective. Like, you&#8217;re working with partners. You&#8217;re working with other collaborators too, right?</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. I&#8217;m always working with other people. As much as I&#8217;m doing independent work, I&#8217;m constantly working with other people. Most of the work that is shown on the website and on my Instagram is collaborative, and I try to stress that point that collaboration is really key in certain instances and necessary to actually expand my capabilities and the capabilities of the people that I work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, and I&#8217;m looking at the site&#8230;I mean, you have a very impressive list of clients and collaborators. I&#8217;ll list off a few of them. Medium, HBO, Nickelodeon, Impossible Foods, and even some,  you know I was saying before we recorded, I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen your work before. I knew that it was from you.&#8221; But like Bon Ton, which was this&#8230;I think it&#8217;s Bon Ton is still in Midtown. I was thinking of TOP FLR for some reason, but Bon Ton is below TOP FLR. TOP FLR is now something else.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>But also, you did a lot of work for Brittany Bosco.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What are the best types of clients that you prefer to work with?</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>All of those clients listed. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve listed any of my bad clients, now that I think about it. I wasn&#8217;t even intentional. I think I just did that. But all of those clients were great clients. I think that the best clients are the ones who see you for who you are and sort of are excited about just, like, applying your capability and letting you do your thing. For the most part, they essentially hire you to do what they hired you to do, right? They let you do what they hired you to do. They are collaborative, and those are the clients that I really appreciate. It doesn&#8217;t mean that the work is without criticism and critique. I think the best clients also give good feedback and give a good critique. So it&#8217;s a good balance of letting you do your thing and also making sure we achieve the goal together.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, what are some of your plans for The Young Never Sleep in the future? I mean, you mentioned YOO, and I&#8217;m looking and seeing that you&#8217;ve been working on something called YOO Gen. So I think this is all sort of combined together. What are kind of your plans that you want to achieve through the studio?</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about that a lot. It&#8217;s a tricky knot to try to untangle. I think that the way I&#8217;m going with things is I think I would love to keep the studio running in its current form as, like, a practice that provides design services and offers a space for creatives to collaborate and express themselves. And as an extension of that, I think I want to push further and further into this world building space, essentially taking all of these stories that The Young Never Sleep has developed over the years and starting to realize them in multimedia formats. So things like gaming, mixed reality gaming, immersive, interactive experiences, simulated environments, physical environments. Yeah, just like, expanding those narratives and making them kind of bigger and more impactive and interactive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now it feels like you&#8217;re doing this at a time when I mean, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s just at a really good time because of everything that&#8217;s going around with AR/VR/mixed reality. There&#8217;s, of course, a lot of generative AI. I feel like AI has been put into everything, or it&#8217;s trying to be put into everything these days.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I recently had Carl Bogan on the show, who&#8217;s the guy behind Myster Giraffe who does these viral deepfake videos. And we had talked about cultivating media literacy. We talked about critical thinking to help people navigate what&#8217;s synthetic media and what&#8217;s real media&#8230;or authentic media, I should say. I&#8217;d love to kind of get more of just your thoughts around all of this &#8212; around what&#8217;s been occurring with AI, how this feeds into kind of this definition of technoculture that you&#8217;ve come up with. I&#8217;m giving you the floor to give your thoughts on all that.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Okay, cool. Yes. </p>
<p>So technoculture is a term that I started using, which was another one of those things that I later come to find out. It&#8217;s an actual term in academia where the idea is to study and understand the relationship between technology and human society and how it sort of evolves over time, how they co-evolve and co-exist together. I&#8217;ve taken that same kind of philosophy and practice and kind of expanded it further to just include all of nature and recognizing that nature is in many ways inherently technological. </p>
<p>When you look at evolutionary biology and the behavior of animal cultures, they have cultures, they have social organization, like I talked about before. They make tools, they make technologies and do science experiments of their own. And from that lens, understanding that, again, this technological outcome is just one, essentially, that can exist based on specific context. So the trajectories are really exponential when you look at, okay, what happens when this non-human animal is allowed to continue to evolve, for example, and their technological sort of paradigm starts to expand and evolve on its own. What would that look like, or even from a human perspective, if said indigenous culture was able to thrive instead of being extinguished? What would our technologies look like today? Would they still be gray metal laptops that we stare into all day? Or would it be something totally different? And that&#8217;s an exciting thing that is usually taken on by science fiction. But the world we live in is a sci-fi already. So it&#8217;s exciting to just think about it that way and also to start putting those things into practice and start actually making these technologies, which is something I&#8217;m excited about, this endeavor of technoculture, part examination, part archiving, part practice and research and development. </p>
<p>Underneath that is this vast body of research into the science of information, which has kind of connections to so many different things that helps kind of lay the foundation for that practice. Information science touches everything from quantum physics to the invention and evolution of language to how we organize information in our lives, how information is organized in nature and in art. It&#8217;s super interdisciplinary. So I think that&#8217;s why I kind of latched onto it. And when we start kind of connecting those things and you start talking about something like artificial intelligence and putting it into context I don&#8217;t actually like the term artificial intelligence. I think artificial kind of implies that it&#8217;s not natural, which I don&#8217;t completely agree with. And intelligence implies that it&#8217;s intelligent, which intelligence is always a moving target, just like consciousness. Our idea of it continues to evolve as we learn more. And I think when you start asking questions about what is artificial intelligence? And you put it into the context of anthropology, sociology or evolutionary biology, you start sort of looking a bit deeper and looking at things like capitalism, for example, which I could place under the umbrella of artificial intelligence or white supremacy, which I could put under the umbrella of artificial intelligence or patriarchy, these autonomous systems that operate on agents. You&#8217;d be hard pressed to say, like, who has the hand on the wheel in that scenario? Is it the system itself or is it the individual people? And the reality is it&#8217;s both. It&#8217;s like a mixture of both. So in that context, artificial intelligence more broadly is just about non-human intelligence, quote unquote. So you can look at animal culture and say, how do we define intelligence based on this? Here are obviously conscious beings who don&#8217;t have a language like ours, who don&#8217;t do things the way that we do, but they are intelligent in their own multifaceted ways. It starts to bring up questions about human intelligence and if certain people are deemed disabled or neurodivergent or so on and so forth, like, is that accurate or do we need to think differently about it in the context of our society? So it just opens up a vast amount of questions. And I&#8217;m kind of excited about pursuing the philosophical challenges of it as well as the technical challenges and the ethical challenges. I think they all need to kind of go hand in hand. And it really to me is a provocation to challenge some of the things that we have just accepted as fundamental to our society. </p>
<p>As much as we want to challenge artificial intelligence, we have to, I think, simultaneously continue to challenge our economic paradigm, which is itself a technology, our socioeconomic paradigms, our political paradigms, which are also technologies. So, yeah, it&#8217;s an exciting kind of territory, and to me, it&#8217;s all connected. So it&#8217;s worth questioning all of it and embracing the idea that we have the agency to change it or work with it in a different way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, we absolutely do.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I think what I like the most about even what you&#8217;ve just described now is you&#8217;re taking technology and expanding the definition out of, I guess, what we would consider as computers. I guess that&#8217;s kind of the best way to put it, because, I mean, technology really is applying knowledge to achieve a goal in a reproducible way. So, like, the wheel is technology, the printing press is technology, but then food, the telephone, the Internet, et cetera, all of that is technology. And I think certainly the modern definition of tech has been strictly constrained within computers, the Internet, the Web program, like, all that kind of stuff, 100%.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s funny &#8212; my mom tells me this sometimes about computers, because I don&#8217;t want to say she&#8217;s a luddite. I don&#8217;t want to put it in such harsh terms, but she&#8217;s pretty anti-computer. It took a long time for her to get a cell phone, she doesn&#8217;t have a computer at home, and was pretty anti-computer for a while. And she would often tell me humans taught rocks how to think, and we put them in a box and then lost our minds, which is a really kind of an abstract way to think about it, but then you think about the chips and all that stuff is rocks. That&#8217;s true. But, yeah, this is all interconnected. Like, none of this stuff is happening within a vacuum. </p>
<p>I think we even see now, just even talking about AI and VR and things like that, these are being applied as layers onto our current reality in ways that kind of make sense and kind of don&#8217;t. I think there are still particularly with a lot of AI stuff, there&#8217;s infinite possibilities and zero guardrails. There&#8217;s no kind of real I don&#8217;t want to say legislation, but there&#8217;s no sort of guardrails or ethics behind some of this stuff. I think individual entities are putting ethics behind it, behind the work that they do. But now the technology exists and is commonplace enough for you to spoof someone&#8217;s entire digital identity 100%. And it&#8217;s like, well, what happens in those cases? When that happens, it&#8217;s one thing to have identity theft, but then someone has also taken your face and your voice and is able to reproduce things that you could say that sound like you, and it&#8217;s like, well, it sounds like Black Mirror. It sounds like science fiction, like you said. But it&#8217;s now this is all these are all things which can happen right as this podcast is playing right now.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely, yeah. And I think I mean, even as you described it, I&#8217;m working on a story called &#8220;Beloved&#8221;, which is based on Toni Morrison&#8217;s book. And I started thinking about this after watching an interview of hers where she describes the mother taking her infant&#8217;s life in order to prevent it from being enslaved. And that story primarily is about artificial intelligence and the ethics of AI from the vantage point of that narrative. Because even as we&#8217;re talking, what you just described, someone taking your identity and taking your face and using it to say things that you wouldn&#8217;t say or make a caricature of you, these are things that we already have experienced, especially as marginalized people, especially as Black folk. When you talk about enslavement chattel slavery, the identity destruction and reconstruction that had to happen through that process over generations, hundreds and hundreds of years, when you talk about minstrelsy and Blackface and things like cultural appropriation, the artificial intelligence, quote unquote, of white supremacy has already kind of rendered this sci-fi experience of being Black. </p>
<p>One of the great ways to think about AI ethics is to look at the already lived experience of people like indigenous folks and Black folks and queer LGBTQIA people. And really, it&#8217;s a mirror of the potential destructive outcomes of a technology like this that is already, as we know, very much embedded with these biases. And it&#8217;s also a mirror of some of the potential beauty that can come from that when we have the agency to affect those systems. Because it&#8217;s always an evolutionary process. There&#8217;s always going to be a tie that comes in and a tie that goes out. Technology is always going to be used in nefarious ways, for the most part. Like you said, the guardrails are off, the cat&#8217;s out of the bag, Pandora&#8217;s box is open. And, yeah, my mom says to do your best. I think that&#8217;s kind of like, the task at hand, is to try to do our best with the information that we have, but we got to do it for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And now technoculture, the definition of technoculture that you have is the framework for something else that you&#8217;ve been constructing called Communion. Can you talk about that?</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. So after I left Snap, after downloading all of the information from spending four years there and all of the stuff that I was doing on the side and my own research since, at least I think the seeds of Communion have already been there. But at least since 2015, I did a show in Oakland called &#8220;Another World Is Possible: Race and Gender in the Age of Transhumanism.&#8221; And that&#8217;s, I think, when I started the seed of this framework. </p>
<p>But certainly after I left Snap, I kind of went to a group of thought leaders who are also mutual friends, collaborators, with this idea for a platform that was essentially a new kind of like information Internet and manufacturing infrastructure. And after presenting that and sort of taking a step back and thinking about it more deeply, I realized I needed to do a bit more work on this idea. So I started breaking it out into different frameworks. </p>
<p>So at the base, so to speak, information science kind of sets the stage for technoculture, which is the space that we sort of explore and sort of facilitate the production of different technologies through this kind of philosophical shift and then through that process, Communion, I think of as frameworks. </p>
<p>So one of them, for example, is a legal ethical framework for alternate realities. So when we talk about things like AI, like deep fakes, like AR/VR&#8230;this framework specifically is geared around how do you deal with illegal ethical challenges in virtual reality. I&#8217;ve read stories about people getting assaulted, like assaulted by groups of people in VR and different types of violence in VR. I&#8217;ve read stories about augmented reality and sort of being able to manipulate people&#8217;s reality and their perceptions using things like deep fakes. And it&#8217;s a vast, uncharted, very complex territory that I don&#8217;t think a lot of our institutionalized government authorities really have a sense of how to navigate. To me, it is a very much a grassroots effort that needs to take place. So that&#8217;s one of them. I have several others. </p>
<p>One of them is about full systems health and wellness; a framework for that. So thinking about the different dimensions of a person&#8217;s individual, collective and sort of global experience of health and what would it look like to actually make a healthcare infrastructure that takes into account how we relate to technologies. How? You use the Internet, how you use social media, the food you eat, your cultural context, what your background is as Black people understanding how deeply systemic injustice is to our individual health and the health of the planet. Kind of connecting all these things together and going like, okay, every person lives essentially in their own reality. And based on that, every single person needs to have a different sort of approach to health that&#8217;s specific to them. But it also can be navigated as something that&#8217;s beneficial for the collective. So that&#8217;s another one. There are several others that kind of, like, are all about different subjects. So communion is just a series of frameworks that could then be applied to a person&#8217;s individual life or as a body of research for institutions and things like that. That&#8217;s kind of the long and short of that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>To me, all of this sounds utterly fascinating. </p>
<p>Right around this time last year, I was working at this startup, I was working at this French-based startup and they wanted to make a magazine dealing with product communities. We had already published, or we already had two issues that we had done. It was a quarterly magazine called Gravity. And for the third issue, we wanted to do something on Web3. They had the idea come out like, &#8220;yeah, we want to do something on Web3.&#8221; This came directly from the CEO because I think he wanted to try to pivot the company into Web3 stuff. And people at work were like, &#8220;no, if the issue is going to be about Web3, I don&#8217;t want to write about it. I don&#8217;t want to have anything to do with it.&#8221; And I&#8217;m the editor-in-chief of the magazine, so I was like, &#8220;okay, fine. We can find some people to write about it. This magazine doesn&#8217;t live or die if you don&#8217;t decide to do it; it&#8217;s totally okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so we brought in a Web3 ethicist to serve as our guest editor for the magazine. And we put together a slate of different topics and articles. And some of it was on the things that you just mentioned on what does digital identity theft look like, what does safety look like in the metaverse, that sort of thing. And this was like a year ago. Unfortunately, I got laid off along with our entire team, and so they completely not only killed the issue, but killed the magazine as well. So unfortunately, none of that stuff will ever see the light of day. </p>
<p>But I do find it all super fascinating because these are going to be the realities that we have to contend with in a few years. And I&#8217;ve been around on the web since the 90s, so I see also the parallels between stuff happening now and stuff that happened back when the Internet for sure started to become a thing. Like, the concept of real estate in the metaverse, for example, was very similar to what I remember the million dollar home page being like the Million Dollar Homepage was like this website where people bought ad space. Like they could buy like an 88&#215;31 pixel web space and put whatever message or something on the very similar to, I guess, like r/place on Reddit. Like, something like that, but people paid for it. And then like, the concept of real estate in the metaverse where people are paying tens of thousands of dollars to have a plot of land &#8212; quote unquote, &#8220;land&#8221; &#8212; in a Metaverse that not only is not interoperable, but kind of doesn&#8217;t exist really. I literally was in a conference&#8230;not last year, this was 2021. It was a metaverse conference in the metaverse, and someone during one of the talks had bought like an acre of land for $10,000. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why? What are you going to put there?&#8221; I don&#8217;t understand what that even means. You&#8217;re buying $10,000 worth of space in the metaverse. I guess you could put a digital house there and show off your NFTs. Remember when NFTs were a thing? All of this stuff is changing in such a rapid fashion, and then of course, culture is trying to catch up with how this is all happening. And so it just reminds me of the time back when the Internet was first becoming a thing and people were trying to stake their claim with websites. Companies were really skittish about if they should even put their business online. It&#8217;s all, I think, connected in that way. Like, I&#8217;m seeing those patterns re-emerge.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. There&#8217;s this quote that &#8220;history doesn&#8217;t repeat, but it rhymes,&#8221; which I like a lot. And, yeah, you&#8217;re absolutely right. There was stuff like GeoCities back in the day, which was very similar to that. The Sims in the 90s, which is obviously the metaverse. A lot of old games that even I used to play, like Age of Empires was a game that I used to play way back when on the computer, where you basically build your own civilization from scratch. There&#8217;s all of these things that, yeah, we had and that are kind of reemerging in this new environment. And, yeah, there&#8217;s so much of it, and it&#8217;s happening so fast that I certainly don&#8217;t think aging somewhat archaic government institutions can really navigate this territory. But I think that the people who have had experience in that space, the gamers and creative technologists and creative people, artists do, and I think it&#8217;s, again, an opportunity to challenge the institutions that we sort of just accept.</p>
<p>I think your sort of description of the digital real estate is a great example because, yeah, it&#8217;s technically not real, but it is real, and it starts to challenge our idea of what&#8217;s real or not, which has pros and cons. But when you think about a concept like Manifest Destiny &#8212; how the country was conquered and these false deeds that allow people to take land and property and kind of a fabricated legality behind it &#8212; it&#8217;s pretty fascinating. Because to me, in that context, it&#8217;s like, okay, there&#8217;s like, a subtle difference between somebody holding a piece of paper that, because of their authority, makes them the owner of a thing that they can just then take from you. And this other thing, which is digital, which is kind of two sides of the same coin, and the physicality of it is sort of sometimes just an inconvenient kind of truth about the way we experience the world. But, yeah, I mean, that&#8217;s what I get excited about information science about is when you get into, like, quantum physics and all of the really weird stuff about reality intangibility, but it&#8217;s all connected. And I think, yeah, it&#8217;s fascinating. I think people should be kind of cautiously enthusiastic about this whole space, this whole kind of new digital environment. And it&#8217;s always healthy, I think, to just look at history for examples of how things can go right and how things can go wrong.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. I&#8217;m actually taking that approach now as it relates to social media. </p>
<p>So, like, we&#8217;re recording this now at a time when Twitter just became X, like, I don&#8217;t know, a couple of days ago or something like that, right? And people had already been having kind of, you know, reservations about the platform ever since the new owner took ownership and how things have changed. And so of course, since then, a number of different Twitter-like clones have sort of popped up or they&#8217;ve made themselves known, I&#8217;ll say I won&#8217;t say they just popped up, but like, there&#8217;s Spoutible, there&#8217;s spill, there&#8217;s posts, there&#8217;s mastodon has been around for a long time. There&#8217;s blue sky. Instagram came out of left field with threads. And people are trying to determine like, okay, well, where should I go next? Well, should I go over here to Threads? Well, Threads does this, okay, well let me go over to Blue Sky. Well, Blue Sky is like this, and can I get an invite? And it reminds me of 2006, 2007 all over again. One with the invites, that&#8217;s the first thing, right? But then two with also when Twitter was around, then there were a number of clones that had popped up that was trying to take its market space. Eventually there was Pounce, there was Plurk, there was Jaiku, there was Yammer, there might have been a couple of others. And within a year&#8217;s time, most of those didn&#8217;t exist anymore. They either got acquired by a company and shut down or they just couldn&#8217;t hack it, essentially, or they&#8217;ve pivoted to another market. Like, Plurk is huge in Taiwan. I don&#8217;t think anybody in the US really still uses anymore. So I&#8217;ve been cautiously looking at like, oh, well, do I even want to be on these other platforms? Because even with Twitter, I don&#8217;t share a bunch of shit on Twitter now anyway. And I don&#8217;t think me migrating my presence to another platform is going to necessarily change that. Like people will say, oh, I&#8217;m on Threads, and oh, this reminds me of how social media used to be. And I&#8217;m like, look, if Elon Musk is the problem, mark Zuckerberg is not the like, let&#8217;s step back here and put this into some context. But also just thinking of like, I remember the Internet when social media was not a thing and it was fun.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>It was, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So even now, especially as I get older, I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t even want to really have a social media presence. Like as a publisher of Revision Path, I have to think, &#8220;oh, well, where do I want the show to be so people can find out about it?&#8221; So then I have to have those conversations with myself and my team about what even makes sense. But personally, I could give all of this up tomorrow and be fine.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I feel that it&#8217;s kind of like a gold rush, like speculators, like running to whatever the hot town is at the time and trying to stake your claim. So, yeah, it&#8217;s definitely spot on and that would be a good archive, actually, is actually all of the platforms that have come and gone in relation to all this stuff. I think it would be like a humbling thing to see just how many of them have just come and gone and only a small few rise to the top because that&#8217;s just like the nature of the thing. So as we try to rush from one thing to the next, it&#8217;s just like it might be better to just take a minute to think about what it is we&#8217;re actually trying to do and get from these platforms. And is there a way to kind of re-claim that sovereignty and autonomy for ourselves? That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m really interested in and trying to put into practice more regularly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s like, what&#8217;s the connection? Because one thing that people have been talking about, and I promise we&#8217;ll pull this back into talking about Yoo, but one thing with people trying to go to these other platforms is then trying to recreate the social graph that they had on Twitter. So they&#8217;re like, oh well, if you&#8217;re going to be here, then I need to be here, and where are my people that are also on this? And it&#8217;s like, well, you can&#8217;t take your network with you in that way. There&#8217;s your offline real world network that always stays with you. And then there&#8217;s this sort of Ursat, cultivated network that&#8217;s been done through this social media platform that now you have to try to recreate and reconstruct on some other platform that may not even exist within a year&#8217;s time.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And also with the old platform X, Twitter, whatever it is, if you&#8217;ve had people muted or blocked or things of that nature, now that you&#8217;ve moved to this new platform, those restrictions no longer really apply. So they can try to harass you somewhere else. They can try to befriend you somewhere else and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;no, I don&#8217;t talk to you on Twitter; that means I don&#8217;t talk to you anywhere.&#8221; It&#8217;s so weird. It&#8217;s so, like, it&#8217;s very complex, which makes me want to just give it all up. I&#8217;m like, this is&#8230;y&#8217;all can have it.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that serious. Yeah, it gets overwhelming and it&#8217;s especially challenging, I think, for people who find a lot of value in kind of distributing their identity or having new identities online that they can&#8217;t have in quote unquote, real life, because that is something that&#8217;s very beneficial for a lot of people. I would include myself in a part of that. And especially, I think, like, younger generations and queer folks is, like, not generally, but a lot of people find a lot of value in being able to assume a different identity and being able to sort of go to a new town, so to speak, where nobody knows your name, and being able to recreate yourself. And there&#8217;s a lot of challenges behind that with all these new platforms, with legacy platforms that fade away. </p>
<p>One of the things that I&#8217;m really concerned about with Twitter, and just like these social platforms in general is something called link rot. Link rot. This idea that, I think, we forget that the Internet is very ephemeral and that if a server goes down, if people aren&#8217;t there to maintain it, that all of your tweets can just go away or all of the things you&#8217;ve saved in Google Drive or whatever other cloud service or all the things you posted on Facebook can just go away one day. There&#8217;s just this wealth of knowledge on a platform like Twitter that could be lost not only with the name change, but with the infrastructural changes that are there. And it&#8217;s the equivalent of burning down the Library of Alexandria with all of these connections and conversations and this sort of archive of this moment in time that we will never see again. It&#8217;s a little like concerning, not a little concerning. It&#8217;s pretty like it worries me a bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>You know, I did a talk &#8212; oh my God, this is maybe two or three years ago &#8212; I did a talk called &#8220;Content is Subject to Change&#8221; about this very same thing; about how the Internet is not an archive. I know there is the Internet Archive, but that is a small nonprofit. It&#8217;s an institution, yeah, that one can&#8217;t archive the full web because there are certain restrictions around the type of content about the location of said content. It&#8217;s not even available in some countries. So you can&#8217;t archive the full web, but also just sort of talking about with the advent of user-generated content through social media, Web 2.0, et cetera. We are putting so much stuff on the Internet without thinking about how it is being stored, if it&#8217;s being stored, like news articles. Try to find a news article from ten years ago and see if all the images still work, or see if all the links, you know, link rot, like you mentioned, still works. And like, it makes it hard for history purposes, for archiving, et cetera. Yeah, the Internet is very ephemeral in that aspect.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And that&#8217;s like one of the sort of ambitions of you. The platform that I&#8217;m working on with Ami is to at least kind of, in our own way, create these tools and allow people to create their own tools where they can create a living archive of at least themselves, of at least their digital self, and try to connect it to their physical self in a way that is ownable, that has sovereignty for them. And reclaiming all that data, reclaiming all of the information that we&#8217;ve dumped online and making sure that you are able to house it somewhere that you can access and not lose it. Because all of that stuff is hugely, hugely important. People&#8217;s digital stuff is&#8230;I don&#8217;t think we think about this consciously all the time. We kind of take it for granted. But it&#8217;s not until you lose it, it&#8217;s not until the house burns down with all your stuff in it that you&#8217;re like, &#8220;oh man, right. I probably should have saved that somewhere or made a copy of it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yep. Put it on a physical hard drive or something.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, right, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Even as you mentioned that, that kind of reminded me about sort of one of the restrictions of Threads, like when people were sort of looking at different platforms to jump to and sort of the notion you mentioned about people being able to assume different identities on different platforms. Like there&#8217;s who you are, maybe in the real world, but then on the internet you can be a different person or a different identity or something like that. And I know there were people like adult industry professionals, sex workers, porn stars, et cetera, who said that they had joined Threads. And Threads, because it&#8217;s Instagram and Instagram is owned by Facebook, now links them, their stage name, to their real person identity. And that if you try to delete Threads, then now you delete Instagram. So now it&#8217;s like tying together these things. You didn&#8217;t ask to be tied together, but because you&#8217;ve opted into the platform and no one reads the long ass end user licensing agreements or the terms of service, but now that you&#8217;ve opted into it, it&#8217;s like this is what you signed on for.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And you can&#8217;t go back and it&#8217;s super manipulative, I think, and nefarious and not by accident. And yeah, that&#8217;s in and of itself a huge conversation about sex work online and sort of platform and surveillance capitalism. And I have friends who are sex workers. I kind of consider myself to be in that territory, at least online anyway. I have an OnlyFans. It&#8217;s a huge issue. Not only the deplatforming, the silencing, all of that stuff, which I think is hugely messed up because in a lot of ways these platforms make a lot of money from the revenue that&#8217;s generated by these users, these citizens of their platforms, while at the same time silencing them, even sometimes encouraging violence and disrespect towards them. There aren&#8217;t a lot of really safe equitable spaces for sex workers and marginalized folks online and I&#8217;m excited about seeing more of that. I think the metaverse &#8212; not Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s metaverse &#8212; but the Metaverse more broadly and gaming and kind of world building environments is at least one space that I feel excited about the opportunity for those things to open up more and just people like making their own platforms. I think back to the era of blogging, like hosting your own platform yourself. I think that&#8217;s exciting and I think we&#8217;ll probably see people do more of that for sure because I think people are getting really fatigued with all of this stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, no, absolutely. I feel like we could have a whole other podcast episode just about what we talked about with the advent of technology through porn and sex work. Like a lot of technological innovation, especially like when we talked about synthetic media and things like that. Unfortunately it&#8217;s come because of that, that innovation has spurred technological innovation. But we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time talking about this. I want to make sure that this interview is also about you. So let&#8217;s switch gears here, learn more about you. Now, you&#8217;re originally from Cleveland, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. Yeah. I was born and raised there. </p>
<p>I lived there until I was about 13, and then I moved around in the south quite a bit. I went to high school in Douglasville, Georgia, for about a year. I went to high school in Montgomery, Alabama. That&#8217;s actually where I graduated high school. And I ended up going to SCAD in Savannah for two years. I&#8217;m a college dropout. </p>
<p>I loved my time at SCAD, especially the people. And just like, that city, I think, is beautiful. Yeah. I was a 3D animation major and an illustration minor. I thought I wanted to work at Pixar at that time. That was my first kind of venture into the 3D space, at least using computers. And I think it kind of stuck with me even though I hadn&#8217;t revisited it until more recently. A lot of the ideas, understanding the potential of it definitely stuck with me. I&#8217;ve always been interested in science and technology. I would have just as soon went into robotics or something like when I was a kid. I wanted to be an aeronautical engineer. I wanted to be a paleontologist. I had all these kind of aspirations. I think that&#8217;s true for a lot of creative people.</p>
<p>I think something that I realized about kind of the world we live in is the unfortunate sort of reality of this kind of reductionist approach to so many things, where you have to choose one thing to be when that&#8217;s not really how the world works. And that was definitely a big part of starting the studio, was that using it as a vehicle to do whatever I wanted to do. And I think people feel inspired to rally around that. So, yeah, that&#8217;s been the journey with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, after SCAD, I saw that you kind of worked for a while as a designer. You worked for Radio One for a while, but then you also started collaborating with other creatives. You started this collective called The Big Up. Tell me about that, because it sounds like that&#8217;s kind of been the basis for what you do now through The Young Never Sleep.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, 100%. At SCAD, I met a group of really dynamic people; Bittany Bosco being one of them. Alex Goose, Danny Swain, Lloyd Harold, a number of other amazing people. We all kind of went our separate ways, but stayed in touch. And then after going back to Montgomery for a little bit, I went back to Atlanta. And at that time, I was just doing just like, freelance graphic design, doing club flyers and making people&#8217;s album artwork. Fadia Kader was one of the people who &#8212; </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I know Fadia.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, she&#8217;s awesome. She&#8217;s one of the people who kind of helped jumpstart my design career. And yeah, I started working with Brittany and Alex Goose and Danny really closely. I&#8217;ve done album artwork for Danny. I did some vocals on one of his albums. I&#8217;ve done album artwork for Brittany and her show, kind of posters and things like that. </p>
<p>So, yeah, we started the collective The Big Up, and it was essentially like part label, part creative agency where we just wanted to do everything in house. We made the music, we made the art for the music. We did the set design. We did everything. And that was definitely one of the things that I think transitioned me from being an artist to being more of a design thinker, and certainly like a systems design thinker. And then, yeah, I worked for Hot 107.9 for a little while. I actually lived there for a short period of time. I had an experience with houselessness for a brief period of time, and I actually lived at Hot 107.9 making designs for Birthday Bash. And I would just stay in the studio when everybody left and just sleep there. I&#8217;d always been interested in computers, like, I had a computer at home. It was really old, and I&#8217;d play games on it and do stuff I wasn&#8217;t supposed to be doing. But, yeah, at Hot 107.9, just being there for that time, I was like, obsessively going through blogs. This is the time of LimeWire and all of that stuff. And just torrents and downloading just twenty albums at a time and just listening to Japanese prog rock and just cosmic jazz and all this crazy stuff from everywhere. It was incredible. And I remember I saved all this music on a hard drive, and I ended up losing that hard drive. So I think maybe that might be like some trauma that made me want to archive. There might be some trauma there. I&#8217;m like, I never want to lose anything ever again.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Listen, I have a hard drive here now at the house that&#8217;s got a ton of music on it that I can&#8217;t access for some reason. And I&#8217;m like, one day I&#8217;m going to crack it and get all my music back that&#8217;s on there. So I feel you there.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>The world needs that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>But yeah, The Big Up. Yeah, that was definitely one of the things that was kind of seeded The Young Never Sleep and what was possible through that. You know, it&#8217;s been a journey. I still am connected to Bosco. The last time we worked together was a project with Spectacles. It was one of my favorite projects I&#8217;ve worked on there, actually. And one of the things that kind of set the trajectory for where I&#8217;m headed now with my work. We did her single July 4th or 4th of July. We created this video, which was essentially a concept for a music video game in mixed reality. Yeah, it was a really cool project where we used the AR lenses from a lot of Lens Studio creators, and I made toys based on the characters in a video and made several AR experiences. A really great 360 project. It&#8217;s a really cool one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Brittany was actually on our 2019 honoree list for 28 Days of the Web. Yeah. We have, like, a sister site where, for Black History Month for February, we profile 14 men, 14 women that are doing really interesting, great digital stuff online, whether that&#8217;s design, tech, et cetera. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve done for the past ten years. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been debating on stopping it. This is my first time saying this publicly, by the way, because I&#8217;ve done it for ten years. I&#8217;m like, ten is a good round number. I don&#8217;t know if I want to do it again for next year, mainly because &#8212; and I didn&#8217;t think this would be the case, but I don&#8217;t know, maybe it&#8217;s kind of tied into our conversation &#8212; some people just don&#8217;t want that presence online anymore. They&#8217;re contacting us and being like, &#8220;yeah, could you take down the profile that you did?&#8221; They thanked me when it was up, but then now that it&#8217;s up, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;yeah, can you get rid of that?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Because I&#8217;m like&#8230;yeah. So I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m on the fence about doing it again for 2024, but we&#8217;ve done it since 2014, so it&#8217;s been ten years. So I don&#8217;t know. Maybe we will, maybe we won&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, okay. I feel that it&#8217;s like that. Things change.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Now, when you look back, art, some of the big places you&#8217;ve worked, like, you mentioned, Snap, you were there for four years in L.A. You&#8217;ve also been at Cartoon Network for four years here in Atlanta. When you look back collectively at those experiences, what do you still carry with you from there?</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>My experience working at those places, for me was like, my school. I apply myself in these careers as me, like, learning by doing. </p>
<p>At Cartoon Network, I got a deep appreciation for how to apply artistic thinking to design. There&#8217;s a fine line between art and design, and sometimes it&#8217;s nonexistent. And I think at Cartoon Network, I got an appreciation for how art and design can be the same thing. I got an appreciation for systems thinking again. I tell people we essentially did everything except make the cartoons. So we were, you know, making interstitials, making commercials, print ads, web ads. We did immersive experiences for, you know, we built a booth. I helped make a gigantic inflatable obstacle course in the Bahamas. It was like, so much work that got done making premium clothes and all kinds of things. Working for Cartoon [Network] and Adult Swim, you get a real sense of all of the touch points that have to happen in order to make a project successful or a product launch successful. </p>
<p>So I got a real sense of that there, and I have to thank people like Jacob Escobedo, who got me the job, and for him believing in me not having a degree, just seeing my work. He literally just asked me to bring in a sketchbook. He&#8217;d look through my sketchbook and hire me based on that, which I really appreciate him for that. And then Candice House, I have to say, is someone who sharpened my eye for detail and quality. She, as an art director, you know, is exceptional, and is someone who I think just is exemplary of the Cartoon Network brand. So I got that there, and then I left after four years. I graduated, so to speak, and then I freelanced for a while with that knowledge, working on projects for Dolby and HBO and several other kind of higher profile brands, which it&#8217;s great for me, I think, to go back and forth to have this kind of independent, self-starting thing, but also to be within the institution. Because I think you just learn different things from those experiences. </p>
<p>And then after a while, I got the job at Snap by working with Larissa Haggio, who&#8217;s a fashion designer in L.A. Andrew McPhee, her partner, got me introduced to Snap and the Spectacles team. And at Spectacles, I was there for four years. Another kind of graduate situation. I think the big takeaway there was how hard it is to make tech. I got a much deeper appreciation for the things that I think a lot of us take for granted. When our laptop is on the fritz or the GPS doesn&#8217;t work perfectly, it&#8217;s easy for us to complain. But I got a real reverence for the complexity and challenge of trying to make a piece of hardware and a piece of software and also trying to get it out into the market in a way that people will embrace it. It&#8217;s a very, very hard, complex thing to do. And I was there through four launches, four product launches, doing a little bit of everything with the brand and even influencing the product as well. I got a lot of experience with working with product teams and trying to set the vision and design a product. So I think those two kind of big pillars, Cartoon Network and Snap Spectacles together, I think, alongside my independent work, really set the stage for where I&#8217;m headed in the future.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I love that you kind of referred to both of those experiences as, like, graduation, for sure, because jobs do when we&#8217;re working at these places. They do teach us things. It&#8217;s not just kind of a particular tenure of employment, like some of the work that you did just looking back, like with Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, when I said before that I&#8217;ve seen your work before, I&#8217;ve seen your work before I knew it was you. The Adult Swim singles covers and stuff, some of the best design I&#8217;ve seen. And I&#8217;m like, this is coming out of Atlanta, and I mean, during a time when honestly, and I would probably still maybe say this even now, people don&#8217;t look at Atlanta as a design city.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, 100%.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I think certainly they look at us for entertainment. They look at just the creativity that comes here out of, like, the music scene. But I can tell you, from doing a show for ten years, people do not look at Atlanta for design at all.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>You&#8217;re right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Tech, they&#8217;ve started to because of the startup scene, but, like, design? Please.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Do not get me started about some of the design arguments and conversations I&#8217;ve had locally trying to help put Atlanta on the map about stuff. It&#8217;s just like&#8230;man, I don&#8217;t know. </p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s such a shame. It does such a disservice to the culture to not acknowledge that. A lot of us been doing it for a long time. And I appreciate that you continue to advocate. I think it&#8217;s true. I&#8217;m passionate and committed to Atlanta. I&#8217;m not like, an Atlanta loyalist. Having lived other places, other places are really amazing as well. But I think it definitely does a disservice to the city to not acknowledge the design and art and tech and entertainment and all of those things that are very much present here. What I really see is just like an opportunity, actually to continue to foster the kinds of platforms that need to be unique to this city. I think that&#8217;s one thing that we&#8217;re tasked with, or anyone who&#8217;s creative here, is like, if you&#8217;re a person who&#8217;s committed to this city and committed to seeing it continue to improve, the reference points don&#8217;t need to be anywhere else but this place and the people who live here. And that&#8217;s it. It has its own thing, and that&#8217;s all it kind of needs to be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What do you think it means to be a creative person today?</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s like a common thread for me to see creativity as a way of self-affirmation on a really, really deep level. I think it&#8217;s a way to self reflect and to obviously connect with other people. I think from that place, when I think about something like a term that&#8217;s maybe on the verge of being overused now, this term &#8220;world building&#8221;, even before coming across the word, I think that our task of world building. As creative people, whether that is world building through writing a novel or doing photo shoots or making video games or creating a space where people can come and enjoy themselves or receive healing. I think world building as a practice is kind of our premier task. </p>
<p>The way that I sort of contextualize this for people is like me as a young black queer kid growing up, the world  builders that I knew were my grandmother and my mother and my aunt who, when I stepped into their homes, I was confronted by all of this beauty. Black intellect. My grandmother had libraries about Black people, about Africa and Black dolls, and the walls were painted colorfully and bright, and my aunt&#8217;s home is just&#8230;you step into this world that&#8217;s, like, self-affirming, and it really just nourishes you. And it builds you back up to step out into the world, into a world that is not always so affirming. And to me, I think that&#8217;s the premier, I think, task is to continue to build that world and to do it together and bring it all together because we have the power to shape the trajectory of the world we live in and change the outcomes just by making it by making it real. And I&#8217;m excited about that. And I think the depth of that pursuit means challenging institutions continuously. Challenging how education is disseminated, challenging how social systems are disseminated, challenging authority kind of at all levels. Yeah. And just, like, affirming ourselves and even making something a little bit better is, I think, a win a victory.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>In recent years, what would you say is one of the biggest lessons that you&#8217;ve learned about yourself?</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s been humbling and exciting to put my own creative pursuit within the context of this sort of deep time. Being conscious of that. It&#8217;s opened a huge window for me as a part of my research. I recognize that, oh, wait&#8230;the sort of visual and sonic and conceptual themes that I am tapping into through my work all exist on a continuum and in a network of all these other minds and ideas and sort of questions. And once I step back and sort of look at that in that context, you start to get a different picture. Like, a different picture emerges of, like, okay, we&#8217;re all having this collective conversation. Like, touching on this idea of artificial intelligence again, is like this sort of collective consciousness that&#8217;s present through history, through this deep time of nature and all these things tracing that thread, it&#8217;s sort of simultaneously reduced who I am and also expanded it in ways that are just, like, reinvigorating. And it&#8217;s pretty profound to me, it&#8217;s felt profound.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, this might be a big question kind of given, I think, the general kind of trajectory of where your work is, but what kind of work do you want to be doing within the next five years? What&#8217;s the next chapter look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little tricky because there&#8217;s kind of a duality. I want to be more accepting of where I am, whatever that circumstance is, and in many ways just live small, live in a more small way on a personal level. But at the same time, I want to show people what&#8217;s really tangibly possible through the practice of world building and self kind of recreation. We&#8217;re living in this sci-fi world, and we watch really entertaining shows, you know, Black Mirror and Marvel movies or whatever, all these things that are really cool, like narratives. But I think I want to kind of take storytelling a little further. I really want to make tangible extensions of myself or of other people or worlds that people can really step into, make that collectively with other creatives. </p>
<p>I think the practice of world building&#8230;I take it really seriously because I know that a world has been built for me to live in. I always use Frank Ocean&#8217;s line &#8212; &#8220;living in an idea from another man&#8217;s mind.&#8221; I think that perfectly encapsulates our current circumstance. That somebody had an idea that one person of a color was less than another person, and now we live inside that idea. And a lot of the things that we now have to contend with as social institutions were just somebody&#8217;s idea that they wrote in a book, just proselytized to their group of friends. And then it became a global institution that has industries and infrastructure and military might to support it. And that to me is like fascinating that that can happen from just the seed of an idea. </p>
<p>So the creative pursuit, I think, is not to be underestimated that you as a person who has a concept or has an idea, you couldn&#8217;t begin to comprehend what that could look like in ten years, 100 years, 1000 years. And I kind of want to show people that that when we say another world is possible, that no, actually, yeah, the world like, for real, and that it is. And it&#8217;s not only possible, but it&#8217;s probable and practical as well. That&#8217;s what I want to do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, just to kind of wrap things up here. And I know we&#8217;ve covered a lot, but just to wrap things up, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work? Where can they follow you online?</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>So you can go to @theyoungneversleep on Instagram or theyoungneversleep[.com] online. My Instagram has a Linktree with a bunch of other links as well that people can jump into. Those are the best places to find me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, sounds good. Branden Collins. Wow. Wow. This conversation was so good. I think one it was just, I mean, first of all, thank you again for coming on the show. But the stuff that you&#8217;re covering are the things that I think as designers, as creatives, as technologists, we need to be thinking about because we&#8217;re probably best equipped to actually help to shape that future of what things can look like through 100% technology, through visuals, et cetera. And I just thank you for helping to put these ideas out there. Thank you for the work that you&#8217;re doing. Hopefully one day we&#8217;ll have rum together at El Malo for sure. But yeah, again, thank you so much for coming on the show, man. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Branden Collins:</b></p>
<p>Thank you very much. Have a good one.</p>

<p>Sometimes in life, you&#8217;ve got to do what you can to make the best out of a bad situation. For Shanae Chapman, that meant using a bad post-graduation job market to launch her own agency, <a href="https://nerdydiva.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Nerdy Diva</a>. Now she&#8217;s setting her sights on bigger goals and doing what she can to help others achieve success in tech and design.</p>
<p>We began by talking about how Shanae started her agency, and we discussed the current state of AI tools and the changing landscape of UX research and design. She also spoke about growing up in St. Louis, attending college, and shared how she used her collective work experiences to dive deeper into the world of UX. For Shanae, hard work and motivation have been the keys to her success!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right. So tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m Shanae Chapman. I am the CEO, founder, and managing director of Nerdy Diva, a consultancy that specializes in UX research and design and training services and building community for people of color in tech.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice. How has 2023 been going for you so far? Any special highlights?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s been an up and down journey. So in addition to having Nerdy Diva as my business the past five years, I also typically worked a day job in tech as well. And I went through a layoff, as many people did earlier this year, and just have been processing, going through layoffs and thinking about what&#8217;s next in my career and in my business and getting support for myself, and then also sharing those resources out with the community.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I know last year there were just sort of this huge wave of layoffs from tech companies and it felt like, a little bit, that wave had sort of abated because you hadn&#8217;t heard about it much this year. But people are, unfortunately, still getting laid off from companies. So I&#8217;m really sorry to hear that. But you have now, kind of&#8230;your full focus is on Nerdy Diva, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>That is correct, and I&#8217;m very excited for what the future holds. I&#8217;m currently working on a partnership with LinkedIn. I&#8217;m teaching a design course that will be released hopefully in Fall 2023.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh nice. So hopefully by the time this comes out &#8212; this will air in September; right now we&#8217;re recording it a bit earlier &#8212; but maybe by the time this comes out, then it&#8217;ll correspond with your course.</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s going to be exciting. Definitely going to be out in Q3. Later in Q3 or maybe early Q4 this year.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Very nice. So let&#8217;s talk about Nerdy Diva. You mentioned you&#8217;ve been doing it now for about five years, how did you get started with it?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I have always done freelance projects during my career. I&#8217;ve been working in design in some way and fashion for the past sixteen years and started out as a college student taking design classes at St. Louis University and learned the basics of graphic design while studying from professors who were working in the field and who had businesses and were also teaching as adjunct instructors. So that was a big insight for me to see that, oh, people can have their own businesses, do design, be creative and teach. And that&#8217;s something that really stood out to me and led to me trying it out myself as a 19-year-old saying, &#8220;you know what, I&#8217;m going to see how I can do this.&#8221; And I would go out to small businesses in the area and go to campus departments and ask if people had any design projects that they needed help with and that&#8217;s how I started my career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m looking at the Nerdy Diva website now and it&#8217;s great that you have your values, you&#8217;ve got your mission, vision statements, stuff like that. How has business been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been an interesting year. I have seen more of the teaching and training projects come in, like the LinkedIn course that I&#8217;m working on currently. And there are some other organizations that I&#8217;m in talks with about teaching and training on design and research. It&#8217;s been a little slow on actually doing the design projects. I think there&#8217;s a lot of economic instability at this time with a lot of companies. The layoffs persist. So the layoffs have been going on throughout this year across design, and that brings in a lot of unknowns and a lot of uncertainty about what&#8217;s next. So something that I&#8217;m doing is reaching out to organizations that we may not always think about who need design as well, like our government agencies and our nonprofit organizations who may also need support and design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. With the way that the economy has gone now &#8212; we&#8217;re kind of recording this right now, near the beginning of some companies, like fiscal year &#8212; I think at this time, companies might start thinking like, &#8220;oh, well, what could we possibly spend money on this year?&#8221; But a lot of places are still just kind of waiting to see how the economy will bounce back, if the economy will bounce back. I know in my case, I was laid off last year and what it felt like was that companies really were just seeing what other companies were doing and just following suit. So in some ways, it wasn&#8217;t about, &#8220;oh, we need to cut back to save money.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;well, if all the other businesses in our sector are cutting back, then maybe we need to cut back too.&#8221; But in that respect, it&#8217;s kind of been a bit of a good time if you&#8217;re freelancing or if you&#8217;re doing contract work, because companies might be more apt to do something short-term than long-term.</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, and it&#8217;s good to have options. It&#8217;s good to have multiple streams of income and being a freelancer, but then going the step higher to that and incorporating your own business. And I&#8217;ve had my LLC since 2018, incorporating my LLC, and then being able to take on projects and design projects where I&#8217;m able to work on that, but also have the opportunity to hire contractors and interns who also get opportunities to be creative and to grow as designers and grow their careers. That&#8217;s really empowering and really something that is rewarding for me as a business owner.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So what does a typical day look like for you now?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>There are no typical days, but generally I&#8217;m checking my email from people who are potential partners and looking at ways to get more visibility for the work that we do on design and training and connecting more recently with the local chamber of commerce here in St. Louis, but also growing in Boston, which is my second home. I went to grad school in Boston and Northeastern University and started my career in design and technology and the corporate level in the Boston area. So being able to connect more with the businesses there and definitely taking advantage of opportunities for minority owned business contracts and contracts for women business enterprises. And I think that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s really important for design businesses to also get those certifications so that we have those opportunities that come up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Was it difficult for you to get those for your business?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a process. So it&#8217;s definitely something where you have to do your homework and do your research. And for me, it&#8217;s something where I&#8217;m still in that path of finding all of the resources and tools to get certified in Boston. And I think it&#8217;s definitely worth it because it opens up more doors for you to have bigger clients and take on bigger projects. And for me also, that sense of being able to work on projects that impact everyday people. So being able to work on civic tech projects is something that is really important to me. And having those opportunities come in&#8230;yeah, it&#8217;s what I want to do. So being able to work on the things that you want to do and not just that you have to do, definitely is a game changer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, you talked about civic tech. Are those like the best types of clients that you want to work with or do you have kind of a broader set that you&#8217;d normally like to work with?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Definitely looking for more opportunities to work with government agencies, city level, state level, around building up more intuitive resources for communities, whether that&#8217;s increasing the usability of websites and apps for services, whether that&#8217;s helping people find information who are looking for ways to get around the city, as with transportation or for healthcare resources, being able to connect people to the information and tools that they need to have a positive quality of life. That&#8217;s something that&#8217;s really what I want to focus on in the work that we do. So design for good, using technology for good.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, I know a lot of Black business owners, especially those that kind of work, I guess you could say, in the DEI space &#8212; I&#8217;m using air quotes around that. But I found a lot of Black business owners kind of had a bit of a bump during the summer of 2020 when companies were pledging like, we&#8217;re going to work with more black businesses or BIPOC businesses, et cetera. I&#8217;m curious if you&#8217;ve noticed any trends with your clients over the years.</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Trends in terms of what?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>In terms of the type of work they&#8217;re looking for or types of services, things like that. Are you finding that as time has progressed that clients are asking for different things, wanting different things, stuff like that?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>It kind of stems back to something earlier in this conversation about the budgeting. So there&#8217;s still a need for design and for training on how to do design, especially equitable design. So I run a two-hour workshop on designing anti-racism, and I use the EI and anti-racism frameworks in that workshop and apply it tactically to how do we use this to create more inclusive and equitable designs. Whether that is UI, whether that is using voice technologies, whether that&#8217;s using AI and understanding what it means to have representative harm and allocative harm in technologies, and how can we design more equitable solutions that are not harmful? So I think the need is still there, but it&#8217;s a factor around the budgets. Who has budgets for these projects? And I can&#8217;t speak to the industry as a whole because I&#8217;m not privy to all of that information. But I know for myself, it&#8217;s tougher to find more businesses that are able to have the budgets that can sustain this work long-term. And I think that&#8217;s something that needs to be addressed. Like, if this is really important, then this work needs to have adequate budgets in order to support the work going forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, you talked just a little bit there about AI. Are you using AI now with any of your clients or any sort of AI tools?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s something that has potential. I think design and AI can form a partnership where we&#8217;re using AI to help with some of the more tedious things, like copywriting, for example, but also thinking about the data that goes into those tools &#8212; is it secure? Is the information that would be okay to share publicly, for example? And also during the critical thinking of determining if the information from the AI tools is equitable, is it sharing information that is actually stereotypical and being able to see that and address it? So it&#8217;s something that I think has a lot of potential, but we also have to have checks and balances with it. And going forward, working with clients who will use AI, I think that&#8217;s something that is really important to continue having those discussions about not just using the tool, but being observers of it and also being able to step in and make changes if it&#8217;s not producing what it should in an equitable way.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve encountered some clients, I&#8217;d say probably within the past year or so, that have been&#8230;they like AI because they feel like it&#8217;s sort of like a magic machine to them, like they can put in a question, get out some sort of answer or something like that. But like you said, is the information equitable? And honestly, which tool they&#8217;re using, it matters in terms of what the information is that you&#8217;re getting out. Like, if you&#8217;re using just, like, the base [ChatGPT], I think it&#8217;s version 3 or 3.5 or something like that. Its corpus of knowledge only goes up to, I think, to like, September of 2022 or something like that. So it&#8217;s not like completely up-to-date and even how it puts it together. It&#8217;s sort of just like grabbing information from a whole bunch of different sources and sort of like, smashing it together to say, &#8220;hey, this is what I think you want based on the query that you&#8217;ve given me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s AI. So it&#8217;s not thinking about it, but depending on the tool they might be using ChatGPT 4.5, which is supposed to be up-to-date and brings in current search engine data and stuff like that, but AI is getting kind of added into so many different tools. It&#8217;s getting added into search, it&#8217;s getting added into even like Google Docs and Word and stuff like that. So I agree about the checks and balances. I think it is being kind of implemented really fast and that we&#8217;re not taking time to think too much about the ethics of usage and the ethics of using what you get from it, just sort of, on its face. Like, I agree with what you say about it being sort of a good jumping off point or a starting point, but it shouldn&#8217;t be the answer.</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, definitely. And I think that&#8217;s a big misconception that many people believe that AI tools are factual, they are the truth, they are the end all, be all, and that&#8217;s not the complete story. So knowing that these are tools that have been created and have biases and have bugs and have issues that are still being worked out, understanding that and taking that information with a grain of salt, so to speak. So I think there&#8217;s still a lot of miseducation about how far along the industry is with AI because we&#8217;re really just getting started and there&#8217;s still a lot of risk. And security is another big issue. Like, taking data and not crediting the sources happens as well. So just being aware of that is something that I encourage folks to think about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I know, especially from educators that I&#8217;ve talked with, it&#8217;s been a big thing because students will use it to write papers or pull in information and research. But like you said, there&#8217;s no citation with it. And even if there is a citation, citation may not be correct because it&#8217;s pulling all this stuff from different parts and just sort of spitting something out that might look like it&#8217;s right doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it&#8217;s the right thing. </p>
<p>One of my good friends &#8212; my best friend actually &#8212; he works at Ohio State University. He&#8217;s a professor and he was talking about how one of his students has submitted a paper and it had all these citations from, I think, like the University of Chicago Library or something like that, but none of those citations actually existed. Like, he followed up behind the student and contacted the library and they were like, yeah, none of that stuff is here. But apparently ChatGPT said, &#8220;hey, we pulled this from these sources from the library.&#8221; And maybe part of that was maybe a fraction of it, but not the entire thing. So it is dangerous, I would say, not so much in its usage, but moreso, I guess, in how humans are using it. Like if we&#8217;re just taking it like we said at face value and not changing it at all or fact-checking it, like you said, just assuming that it&#8217;s right is not good because it&#8217;s most likely not going to be.</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, definitely. And I read a story the other day of a college student who got reprimanded from a professor who thought that they had used AI to create their paper because it was so well-written, but the student actually had not used any AI tools to create their papers. So now they&#8217;re getting dinged because the professors are having a hard time differentiating between when is AI being used and when is it not being used. So it&#8217;s a tricky place to be in right now as educators and as students as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Where do you want to take Nerdy Diva in the future? Like, what are your future plans?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I definitely want to continue to grow. And I mentioned civic tech earlier. So one of my goals is to complete all of the certifications that are necessary MBE/WBE and do work with City of Boston, City of St. Louis, City of Chicago, working on projects that impact everyday people and being able to use technology in a way where we&#8217;re able to share information throughout our communities and share knowledge and create more resources and more equity and also continue to grow. My presence as an educator. So very excited for this partnership with LinkedIn. First course will be complete by the fall of this year and excited to continue to make more courses with LinkedIn around design and research and emerging technologies.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s kind of switch gears here a little bit. We&#8217;ve heard a lot about your business, but let&#8217;s learn more about you. Tell me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. So I grew up in a working class family. My mom was a teacher&#8217;s assistant, before she retired, for over 32 years. And so education was very big in our family. My dad was a care mechanic and very hands on and was literally solving problems with all kinds of vehicles, and it was a lot of turning lemons into lemonade and taking what you have and making the most out of it. So those are some of the things that I have carried throughout my life is being able to see the good, find gratitude, be able to think quickly on my feet and keep learning and trying new things and being able to take inspiration and finding out how to walk in new paths and being able to be open to new opportunities. So that&#8217;s something that has stuck with me. And St. Louis &#8212; if you haven&#8217;t been there &#8212; very much a midwest city with Southern influences, so a lot of rich cultural heritage with music, a lot of blues and jazz has come out of St. Louis. Scott Joplin [the] composer; very famous in these parts as well, and a lot of appreciation for good food and breaking bread with family and friends and getting to know people and sharing what you have even if you don&#8217;t have a lot. So those are things that I still hold dear and that&#8217;s still part of who I am now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Were you exposed to a lot of design and tech stuff growing up? Was that something you were around a lot?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>You know what, I was not. So my parents were not technical folks and my parents divorced when I was younger. So just definitely being a young person, dealing with that experience of going through ups and downs and challenges, and what always inspired me was creativity. And I would see that with the art classes that I took in school and reading books and learning about new places and new people and cultures and just having the ability to learn how to use computers and new technologies as they became available at school were things that opened my eyes. Like I&#8217;m old enough to remember when we first got the big iMacs in elementary school and they had them in elementary school and taught us how to use those, and that was like top tier computers back in the day. Yeah, just being able to see that and having the Internet go from dial-up what we had when we were growing up, where you had to either choose to be on the phone, the landline, or be on the Internet, you couldn&#8217;t do both at the same time. So thinking about that and then seeing how things have evolved and now we have these fiber optics and we have such high speed 5G networks and it&#8217;s complete changes just in my lifetime of being 35 years old. So just being able to see that and see it as a user but then also now as a designer, being part of creating what those systems do and how other people get to use them is pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now you talked about going to St. Louis University and you said you took some design courses there too, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>I did, yes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now you majored in communications. Was this just kind of part of the program?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>In general, design courses were part of a suite of electives that you could choose as part of the communication degree. And that&#8217;s something that I highly encourage people who have opportunity to choose their own electives, to choose something that is creative, choose something that you may not have thought about studying before. Find that as a resource for you to test out if you want to get involved in something. So at least you can say, &#8220;oh, I&#8217;ve tried that and I know it&#8217;s not for me,&#8221; or in my case, &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried that and yes, I want more of that.&#8221; So the design course is important, my electives and once I took a class and had the opportunity to use Photoshop and saw how you could use design to convey messages and meaning. I knew that it was something I wanted to be a part of and just kept taking more electives and ended up doing an emphasis in communication technology overall.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>How was your time there?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>There were pros and cons of that experience for me. I had a really good experience learning about design and communication and public speaking, had some excellent professors and adjunct instructors who really valued sharing knowledge and helping students grow as people. So that was really empowering for me. I met a lot of friends there that I&#8217;m still close to to this day. And I worked on campus in the business school in the entrepreneur center. And they were at that time working on a beta project for Black business owners where they were building a facility in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr&#8230;or Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in St. Louis, and they were working with Black business owners to help them get their businesses ready for moving into this space. So I got to see these Black business owners come in and talk about their businesses and work with the university&#8217;s resources and learn what types of challenges they face and what types of tools are helpful for them. So I got to see, like, okay, they need accounting software. Oh, they have questions about hiring. Oh, they have questions about financing. I got to hear those questions, solutions during that process, which was really educational for me as someone who had seeds of, like, &#8220;oh, I might want to try this entrepreneur thing.&#8221; But some challenges were being at a PWI &#8212; predominantly white institution &#8212; and not having that sense of feeling known and feeling a sense of care, being in some classrooms where I was the only Black person in the room, and being asked, like, &#8220;what is your opinion? What is the Black perspective on this particular opinion?&#8221; And this is something where I, as a 19-year-old, educating my classmates and my white professor as to &#8220;this is my perspective. This is Shanae&#8217;s perspective. This is not the perspective of all of Black America.&#8221; So being able to stand up for myself and share that knowledge is something I get from that experience. But it definitely was challenging and [I] definitely had some hard days.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Colleges can be one of those sort of interesting places. It&#8217;s like, on the one hand, you mentioned, yes, try to seek out these more creative courses and things like that, but sometimes, just depending on the school, you often are put in these other sort of trying environments and situations. I can imagine that had to be pretty tough to deal with overall, though.</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And then just being broke. That&#8217;s the thing about college. You have no money all the time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>When you graduated from St. Louis University, what was your early career path? Did you go right into trying to become a designer, or did you sort of kind of have to get your feet wet doing other stuff first?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t able we were in a recession when I graduated with my undergraduate degree, it was 2009. So again, there was economic instability and it was really tough for me to find full-time work just in general, not even design. It was just tough to find any full-time work, being a college graduate and not having corporate and industry experience yet. And those were really tough times. And I went to my school after I graduated. I went back to the university and went to career services and did career counseling. And that was the first time that I had the opportunity to talk to someone about the shame I felt and not being able to find work immediately after graduating. And it opened up perspectives for me to hear someone say, like, yeah, &#8220;of course you would be frustrated, but understand that this is not you, this is the economy. This is competing with people who have more experience and maybe more education, who have connections. There&#8217;s other things happening that are outside of your control,&#8221; and being able to take that in as information and understand that, &#8220;okay, I&#8217;m okay, I can keep going.&#8221; And it&#8217;s not a situation where I&#8217;m doing things wrong and something&#8217;s wrong with me. And being able to have that support was really helpful. And that&#8217;s something that I definitely highly encourage folks to do. </p>
<p>Like, talk to someone if you&#8217;re having tough times in your career. Everyone&#8217;s had tough times. There&#8217;s definitely been times when I&#8217;ve wanted jobs, I didn&#8217;t get them, or there&#8217;s times that I took jobs that I know were not for me ended up leaving. So being able to have those conversations and also get some perspective because our careers are great, they help us support ourselves and take care of ourselves and our loved ones and do purposeful, meaningful work. But your career is not the only thing that you have going on for yourself, and being able to have some perspective about that is helpful too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, I am so glad that you said that. I&#8217;m so glad you mentioned that because I think a lot of folks need to hear that, especially now. Especially, I think, if you&#8217;ve been laid off over the past year. And this is not to say that I feel like &#8212; and this might be a controversial statement, so rock with me here if it gets a little out of hand &#8212; but I feel like particularly in BIPOC communities, particularly in Black communities, we&#8217;ve kind of been sold this fantasy about getting into tech and it being like the solution to everything. Like, you&#8217;re going to get that good tech job and you&#8217;ll be able to pay off your mother&#8217;s bills or get your grandmother something. And I mean, yeah, you can do that with what the salaries are. But I think what gets wrapped in that is sort of your self-image is so intrinsically tied to not just the work you do, but where you work, that once you lose that, it ends up being this huge hit to your self esteem. Like, who am I if I don&#8217;t work for insert big tech company here? You know what I mean? </p>
<p>I really feel especially, like, oh my God, you said you graduated in 2009. Right around that time, I want to say it was like between maybe 2009 and 2011, there was this big push about getting Black folks to go to Silicon Valley. It was like, &#8220;go to Silicon Valley. Be the next Mark Zuckerberg.&#8221; CNN even had this whole special about folks like going to Silicon Valley and they had like a house and everything they were working out of. It was part of their Black in America series. And I think it was good to see that sort of like, upward mobility and prosperity. But then you had a lot of organizations that came about that were just sort of selling this notion that you get this big tech job and you&#8217;re set, you&#8217;ll be able to live the life of your dreams once you work for Facebook or Amazon or Google or whatever. But then it&#8217;s like, when you get laid off from there, then what? </p>
<p>And I think people need to hear this right now. One, because of all the layoffs that are happening, but two, we&#8217;re in this weird economic period now, just like back then, in 2009, and that there&#8217;s this uncertainty. It&#8217;s hard finding full time jobs. I know a lot of people that have been out of work now three months, six months, up to a year, and it&#8217;s really messing with them. They have the skills, of course, to do the type of work that they do, but it&#8217;s so tied into their self-image of like, &#8220;well, how am I a good person if I don&#8217;t work at this company, if I&#8217;m not doing XYZ?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, those are all good points. And I was reading Essence magazine the other day, and one of the women they interviewed, she mentioned that titles are rented; your character is what stays the same. And I was like, &#8220;girl, yes. A word.&#8221; That&#8217;s important. The titles are rented, but you&#8217;re still the same person. You&#8217;re still creative, you&#8217;re still a problem solver. You still know how to bring things together from different parts and bring them together in a meaningful way and create something that has a beautiful outcome. You can still do that no matter if you at Microsoft or Google or wherever. So you still have those skills. And I think that&#8217;s something that we forget about, that it&#8217;s not just about having the name recognition. It&#8217;s about who you are. Who do you show up as?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Titles are rented. I love that. And that is so true. That is absolutely true. Because who you are or who you were at one place may not be who you are somewhere else.</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, in 2012, you started out as an intern at Red Hat. And then after that you started working at IBM as a UX/UI testing specialist. Given kind of the background that you had before starting there, like, what drew you to UX?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, so I was in the tech industry because my master&#8217;s degree is in informatics study of information systems and there is some overlap with UX. And like, I took UX courses as well, classes and understanding how to evaluate and how to audit for usability. So I learned those fundamentals as part of my master&#8217;s degree program and found that to be really interesting because that combines design know how. So having some graphic design, web design background, web development background, but then also understanding the psychology piece on how do people use systems and tools and how to prevent errors and how to help people get unstuck was also something that was enlightening to me. And then the technical side of it and understanding, &#8220;okay, you want to build something, how do you actually know what&#8217;s possible, what&#8217;s feasible, what could you actually build?&#8221; And being able to use the things I&#8217;ve learned in my master&#8217;s degree, that was more technical to bring that together as well. </p>
<p>So I applied to so many internships and entry level positions and interviewed for Red Hat and everything was in person at this time. So interviewed had presentations about why they should choose me and just waited, just waited and then heard word back a few weeks later that I was going to have this offer of this internship. And for me, it was the most money that I had made up until that point at $30 an hour to be a summer intern. And I thought, &#8220;this is great, this is great.&#8221; Now I get to start my career in tech using what I have learned in school and being able to have this big name at the time &#8212; all into the big names &#8212; have this big name on my resume as well. So it was a starting point for me. And I learned a lot. I learned a lot about how large organizations work and didn&#8217;t know before I started there that there&#8217;s so much people involvement, there&#8217;s so much. And you think about design and technology, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;oh, okay, you just kind of do your own thing.&#8221; No, that&#8217;s not how it works. When you actually work for a company, you have so many meetings, you have so much collaboration, you have so much discussing what gets designed, what gets built, understanding analytics and behaviors of trends and patterns. And there&#8217;s a lot of this back and forth and seeing that for the first time and being engulfed in that. Yeah, just definitely it was a sink or swim situation and had to learn quickly how to pick things up and just had to be unafraid to ask questions. So I asked a lot of questions and did really well in that internship. And that was a good starting point for me to move forward into other positions in technology.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And some of those other places that you worked at. I mean, I was looking at your LinkedIn, I was like, you have gotten some great experience.</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Kronos, The MathWorks, Akamai Technologies, Boeing, SmartBear, most recently HashiCorp. When you look at those experiences as a whole, collectively, what do you remember the most? Like, what do you pull from when you look back at those experiences?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Every place I&#8217;ve gone to, I learned something new. I learned something new about what I wanted in my career. I picked up some new technologies. I studied many places. I was also offered certifications, so I would take the time to do the work to earn those certifications. Just investing in myself. And I think that&#8217;s important. </p>
<p>Everywhere you go in your career, you should be learning and you should be earning. And that&#8217;s something that was also important to me as I continued to move up in my career, that I had to learn how to negotiate my salaries and benefits and RSU stock packages. And these are things that I didn&#8217;t know about. Again, my mom was a teacher assistant. My dad was a car mechanic. They didn&#8217;t have those types of conversations, so I had to lean heavily on the people that I trusted. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m in a chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers. And so being a part of that chapter when I was in grad school and after grad school in Boston helped me a lot to understand how does this all work. So leaning on people who have been through these situations before and getting outside of my comfort zone and learning how to negotiate by taking webinars and in-person trainings and bringing that into conversations and not being afraid to have difficult conversations. For me, it&#8217;s a pattern of going to each step and going higher, learning more, growing, taking in knowledge, sharing knowledge. And that has been something that has evolved over time. </p>
<p>So that now I have this career where I&#8217;ve been in technology for the past eleven years and have learned a lot about cybersecurity, have learned about data analytics, have learned about creating tools that scientists and engineers and developers use, but also can take that skillset and also apply it to creating tools for healthcare or for community systems or for knowledge sharing, for education. So being able to take that information and translate it for different audiences, I think that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s really important and crucial.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, because I would imagine each of these different companies are serving different&#8211;I mean, one, different just audiences based on what they do. But like you said, as you&#8217;re going on, you&#8217;re learning more, you&#8217;re earning more, et cetera. But also the industry is changing. How have you seen UX kind of change over the years in the industry?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>It ebbs and flows. So there&#8217;s times where UX is really top of mind and people want to bring in researchers and designers and everyone&#8217;s looking for that sense of building the right products. And then sometimes you get into situations where it&#8217;s a more &#8220;let&#8217;s build something first and see how it goes&#8221; and take a step back from actually doing the proactive work of the research and design and getting the feedback. And I think that&#8217;s where we are now. </p>
<p>So we&#8217;re in a place where people are tighter with their budgets and they&#8217;re trying to get the UX research and design in multiple roles. So product managers are now doing product discovery and research, and developers are doing some discovery and research, and it&#8217;s getting to a place where they&#8217;re trying to combine roles across different teams. And I think that it squeezes out having people who are dedicated to UX research and design. And I think there may have been a big push earlier on for people to share that, oh, anyone can do research and design. And I think that was overemphasized because it takes away the credibility and it takes away the practice of having the know how and the education and the experience to do quality research and design. Like, sure, everyone can go to Figma and create something quickly, but being able to actually create something that&#8217;s meaningful and that&#8217;s impactful and that takes something complex and makes it intuitive is not something that just anyone can do.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, with the work that you are doing with UX, does that also extend into voice or even AI stuff? Are you finding any sort of changes with the UX industry in those cases?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think there&#8217;s room for UX to work with these tools. So working with voice, working with IoT, working with AI, and there&#8217;s definitely experiences that go beyond the interface. So the experience when you are speaking to Siri, for example, and what is heard and what&#8217;s transmitted back, that&#8217;s an experience also. And I think that UX has a benefit of having that awareness about human centered interaction and human centered design to be able to help teams understand how to make seamless and frictionless experiences, whether there&#8217;s an interface or not.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, what advice would you give to someone that&#8217;s listening to this podcast or hearing your story and they want to start their own UX career? Maybe they&#8217;re like a fresh grad out of college, or maybe they&#8217;re like in the middle of a career change because they&#8217;ve gotten laid off and they want to go into something new. What advice would you give them on getting into the UX industry?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think there&#8217;s a lot of kind of get rich [quick] schemes out here where people are saying many pathways and not to put down boot camps, because some boot camps are sharing quality knowledge and it&#8217;s a step for some people to get some education and start their career. But if you do a boot camp, don&#8217;t let that be the only time that you are educating yourself. </p>
<p>UX is a career path where you have to continuously learn. And if you don&#8217;t want to have to keep learning every day, every year, then it&#8217;s not going to be a good career for you. You&#8217;re not going to find it enjoyable, you&#8217;re not going to find it to be that get rich quick scheme that you thought it would be so you can&#8217;t learn everything about UX in six weeks and then be an expert. It doesn&#8217;t work like that because you also have to have the lived experience, you have to apply it, you have to make mistakes, you have to learn from those mistakes. And it&#8217;s really powerful when you as someone who&#8217;s new to UX, partners with someone who&#8217;s senior and you can just observe how they do their roadmapping, how they talk to clients, how they collaborate with product management and engineering, how they set themselves up for success with their research and design process. So being able to give yourself grace and being able to be patient as well is something I would share. Many times people think like, &#8220;okay, I want to just do things quickly,&#8221; but just because it&#8217;s quick doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s right. So those are my two cents.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Who are some of the people that have really helped you out to get to where you are now? Like any mentors, any peers,  or anyone like that?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, so definitely have had community of mentors and sponsors over the years. I&#8217;m mentioning National Society of Black Engineers, previously Boston chapter, was a big resource for me. So being able to connect with other Black people in technology and some people were developers, some people were product managers and there were a few other designers there as well. And being able to share experiences working in corporate and working on teams, building software, building tools that millions of people use across the world, and being able to share those tips and lessons learned and also learn about financial literacy from some of the events that they had. Also the AAUW &#8212; American Academy of University Women &#8212; they had a lot of salary negotiation trainings when I was earlier in my career that helped me out when negotiating. And also just friends and people who take the time to listen in when I&#8217;m having a bad day when things are hard. And having your tribe of people who you have in your back pocket when things are hard is essential. So being a good friend and staying connected to your friends is something that&#8217;s really important as well. And making that time to do that so that you can show up for your people and that they can show up for you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What&#8217;s bringing you joy these days?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>I have really enjoyed learning new recipes. So I like to cook and I like to bake, and my husband is very happy to be the person who&#8217;s taste testing. Yeah, so that&#8217;s bringing me a lot of joy. And reading as well and thinking about ways to grow Nerdy Diva that are not just focused on technology. Some are thinking about creating a children&#8217;s book and a comic, like an anime book as well. Yeah, just thinking about some of these creative ideas and exploring what&#8217;s next.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What would you say, like, you&#8217;re still in the process of unlearning?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>For me, that&#8217;s unlearning the need to say yes to everything and being okay with saying no, being okay with setting those boundaries for myself on my time and my energy and practicing putting me first and what I need first. And that&#8217;s unlearning the habit of putting others above myself. And I think that&#8217;s really important to remember that you have needs and you have to take care of your needs also.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, what do you want kind of the next chapter of your story to look like? Say it&#8217;s five years or so from now. What do you want to be working on? What kind of things do you want to have done? Stuff like that?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I want to continue to do the things I&#8217;m doing now and just continue to grow those partnerships. So I really want to continue to share knowledge on platforms like LinkedIn and other edtech programs for people who are getting involved in design and technology and want that to be a place where people are able to see someone who has some representation that looks like them, who they don&#8217;t often see in those spaces. Talking about design and analytics and technology and being able to share that knowledge. Also want to continue doing design work for government agencies and communities and be able to create more jobs and opportunities for contractors and interns as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, well, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work, about Nerdy Diva? Where can they find that information online?</p>
<p><b>Shanae Chapman:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, you can find Nerdy Diva at nerdydiva.com, and we are on LinkedIn and Instagram as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, sounds good. Shanae Chapman, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. I think what I&#8217;ve gotten the most out of this and what I hope others get out of it, too, is that there&#8217;s no substitute, I think, for hard work. There&#8217;s no substitute for putting in the work to get to where you are, to sort of put in those hours to get to some level of mastery or information. Because what it definitely sounds like I&#8217;ve gotten from your story is that you&#8217;ve had these experiences, you&#8217;ve worked at these different companies, and now you&#8217;re gaining that knowledge and putting it into your business and using that to also kind of give back through the work that you&#8217;re doing with, like, civic tech or even with these courses and things like that. I&#8217;m going to be really excited to see what comes next for you in the future. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>

<p>What does accessibility design look like at the largest social media company in the world? According to this week&#8217;s guest, Tolu Adegbite, it&#8217;s a lot more than you may think! Between websites, apps, and devices, there are a lot of considerations to factor in, and Tolu&#8217;s unique background makes her well-equipped to solve these problems.</p>
<p>Tolu gave us a peek into the mood at Meta fresh off the launch of Threads, and she spoke about her day-to-day routine being on the company&#8217;s app design systems team. She also shared her story of starting out as a developer, and went into how recent current events inspired her to get more involved with including intersectionality as a key factor in her work. Tolu&#8217;s also writing her first book, so she talked about how she juggles that with also being a graduate student. </p>
<p>Tolu is a great example of how using your life experiences can shape your creative perspectives!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Hi. My name is Tolu Adegbite. I&#8217;m a product designer. Currently in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. And I work on inclusive design. Right now I work at Meta, specifically working on Facebook, the design system, and making that as inclusive as possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Nice. How has your year been going so far?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>My year so far has been really interesting. I think this year started off kind of tough. There were a lot of just layoffs happening in tech. I felt like everywhere I looked on social media, there were just like a lot of sad messages, layoffs people having to really rejig their lives. So I kind of took a step back. I got rid of most of my social media accounts, which is kind of ironic seeing as I work for a social media company, but I really needed to take some time out to get in a better headspace because of all the tough stuff that was going on. But now I&#8217;m definitely feeling a lot more optimistic. I feel like things are turning around, so I&#8217;m feeling good about the year from here on out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, look, I can tell you as someone that also was laid off during that time, I know what you mean about sort of retreating from social media and just seeing all of that as it takes place. Because there was a period last year where I felt like there were layoffs happening every week for like a few months. And not in small numbers either. It&#8217;s like 200 people here, 1,000 people here, and it can be super demoralizing, especially if you&#8217;re somewhere and you&#8217;ve survived a layoff like that. Survivor&#8217;s guilt. It&#8217;s bad and social media just compounds upon it.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. I totally agree. I know so many people who experienced the same thing, but for the people who weren&#8217;t laid off, there definitely is that survivor&#8217;s guilt. Looking around, realizing that it could have just as easily have been you. It was a really unusual way to start the year, especially given last year was the complete opposite. Everyone and their dog had gotten a new job and was talking about it on LinkedIn.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And this is independent of, sort of, talks about layoffs. Social media as a concept has been in a tailspin this year, particularly with the advent of new services &#8212; and we&#8217;ll talk about Threads &#8212; but with the advent of new services and stuff like that, it&#8217;s causing a lot of people to sort of re-examine their relationship to social media. Like&#8230;we&#8217;ll just talk about it. Twitter is crumbling at the moment and people are looking at all these different alternatives to possibly go it could be on Spill, they could go on BlueSky, they could go on Mastodon, et cetera. And it&#8217;s causing some people to say, &#8220;you know what? What if I just divest altogether from social media and not use any of these new platforms?&#8221; It&#8217;s an interesting time to be a social media user, I think.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>It definitely is. I feel like for so long it&#8217;s been a source of a lot of community. I am a chronic lurker. So for years I would lurk on Twitter without ever having an account. But I don&#8217;t think you can even do that anymore. I definitely can&#8217;t see accounts now that I&#8217;m not currently on Twitter, so it&#8217;s definitely an interesting time. Definitely more difficult to look in from the outside if you are also a chronic lurker like I am.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I hear you. Yeah. Twitter is becoming a walled garden. Some of these other places are similarly like that, where maybe you can only see a couple of things, but you have to join. And it would be one thing if the social media were more inherently social, but then it&#8217;s like tied up with algorithms and data collection, and you&#8217;re just like, I just want to talk to my friends and see what they&#8217;re doing and look at cute pictures and all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, especially since the pandemic. I think social media started being a major source of interaction for me during those, what, like, years that we couldn&#8217;t really do much in Ontario. Our laws were pretty intense about lockdown. There was a point in time where you couldn&#8217;t even leave your apartment. You couldn&#8217;t go outside with anyone who you didn&#8217;t live with. So social media was pretty much as much as I interacted with my friends and people that I knew.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. What do you want to try to accomplish for the rest of this year?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about my mindset and perspective on my career. I&#8217;m going to keep it short, but ultimately, I think as a Black woman growing up in this country, I&#8217;ve learned to present kind of a palatable version of myself. And I realize in the work world, it doesn&#8217;t always translate to where I want to go in my career and I&#8217;m having to show up differently. I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time thinking about that, and I&#8217;m really focused on my career this year, where I want it to go and how I think my skill set can kind of propel my career forward.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Can you expand on that a little bit?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. I&#8217;m one of those people who I think, lived in a fantasy land. When I was a kid, I was in my head so much, so I really remember my childhood very well. And I remember as far back as grade one, grade two, sitting in class, feeling like I had to be really good. I don&#8217;t think I could put it to words back then, but there definitely was this feeling that in order for me to not be seen as a problematic child, that I had to present myself in a certain way. I had to be super smart. I had to always be raising my hand and giving answers. I had to be super nice to the people in my class. I just had to be the best student, a model student, and I&#8217;ve definitely taken that through with me today. I feel like I&#8217;m a compulsive people pleaser. And that doesn&#8217;t really translate well into the workplace, especially when you want to take on leadership roles.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. These companies will drain everything out of you and ask for more, so I know exactly what that feeling can be like of always trying to make sure that you&#8217;re showing up in the right way and doing the right things. And oftentimes, even if you&#8217;re doing that, just how you&#8217;re presented in the workplace, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that it&#8217;s going to have a good effect, which can be a bit jarring, I think, especially if you&#8217;re early in your career, it can be a bit jarring because everything that you&#8217;ve been sort of told and seen has been to that point where that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re supposed to do, that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re being told that you have to present and do. And then you get in the workplace and they&#8217;re like&#8230;not so much. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily translate that way.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Especially starting my career as a developer, I definitely did not think about this stuff nearly as much. But I feel like as a designer, half of your craft is just how you show up. You could have the most amazing ideas and innovative, I don&#8217;t know, ideas for apps and ideas. But if you don&#8217;t show up in the right way, if you&#8217;re not confident, no one is really going to take your idea on board as well as if you show up in a certain way, which is really interesting to me. Half of this job is just how you present yourself.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I&#8217;m thinking of like ten to fifteen years ago, when conversations around Black folks in technology, particularly around this new area of tech with social media and stuff like that, and how those conversations have went about and how people are trying to present themselves and making sure that you were a part of all this. It&#8217;s kind of amazing that even now, after all of that, that these are still sort of such big concerns, because company culture &#8212; trust me when I tell you this &#8212; company culture has changed a lot. Like a lot, a lot since then, but yet these are still kind of these pervasive things that mostly people of color have to deal with.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Now that you bring that up, I feel like life kind of exists as life before and after the pandemic, but similarly life before and after George Floyd. And I think I saw a complete kind of change in how I think about work, in what we&#8217;re allowed to say, what we&#8217;re not allowed to say after that. I feel like that completely changed my career. It was recent, but a lot of conversations have happened since then. A lot of conversations that I don&#8217;t think would have happened before George Floyd.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious about this because you&#8217;re in Canada and granted, you know what you&#8217;re mentioning, like with George Floyd and things, this is like&#8230;I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s a uniquely American issue, but certainly it&#8217;s something that people worldwide have been able to resonate with. I&#8217;m just kind of curious know, you being from Canada, growing up in Canada, and now having to sort of hear about these issues and see how it affects your workplace. Like, how does that make you feel?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think growing up in Canada is really interesting. Our proximity to the U.S. makes it so that sometimes I&#8217;m more aware of American news than I am of Canadian news. Our Canadian news sources are definitely talking about American news, but we definitely felt it up here too. I think there&#8217;s this perception that these are problems that are unique to America. They&#8217;re really not. Whenever I go to the U.S. and I meet Black folks, one thing that really strikes me is that very often I&#8217;m asked, &#8220;is there racism in Canada?&#8221; And it really breaks my heart in a way that the thought of Black Americans is like, is there a place out there where this doesn&#8217;t exist? And the answer is no, it exists up here too. But it&#8217;s definitely a different brand. I think Canadian culture kind of makes it more covert, it&#8217;s less out there than it is in America. But we definitely had those conversations. Definitely was a reckoning here too, but probably not to the extent that Americans dealt with.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Hmm. Well, I&#8217;m not going to stay on this. This is not a nationalist podcast about, you know, issues like this. I want to talk about you and your work, so let&#8217;s go into that. So you&#8217;re a product designer at Meta. Tell me more about kind of the work you&#8217;re doing there. You mentioned you&#8217;re on the, sort of, Facebook product. Like, talk to me about that.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I know that when Meta came out as a brand, there was some confusion, but I&#8217;ll just explain it for folks who are listening. Meta is the parent umbrella company that is an umbrella over Facebook. WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, Reality Labs, all that stuff. So Meta is the parent company over Facebook. So yes, I work at Meta, but specifically, mostly on Facebook at this moment in time. And it&#8217;s been really interesting. I think there&#8217;s a very specific external perception, and we&#8217;re not going to talk about that too much. But I will say working at Facebook at Meta, one thing that I&#8217;ve been really surprised by is just the amount of attention that&#8217;s paid to accessibility and inclusive design. It&#8217;s definitely a bigger topic here than it&#8217;s been probably anywhere else I&#8217;ve worked, which is really incredible. Yeah, it&#8217;s really incredible. And I&#8217;m excited that I&#8217;m here at this point in my career that I don&#8217;t have to fight and explain why what I do is important and we&#8217;re just getting to the work and trying to make these products as accessible and inclusive as possible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Tell me more about what does a typical day look like for you? Are you working with a team? Are you working remotely in the office? Like, what does that look like?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>So I work remotely from Toronto. There are several of us here, but not a lot. Most of my coworkers are in the U.S. on the West Coast, in California. But a typical day looks like&#8230;it looks like a lot of conversations with the design systems team; accessibility falls under that team. We do a lot of the typical stuff. We do crits, we talk about components, we talk about the future of our design system. But we spend a lot of time actually thinking about how to make these things considering the largest number of people. When you work on a product that touches billions of people, it really is a huge consideration and something that we spend a lot of time thinking about and talking about.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, I know you mentioned you&#8217;re not going to get too much into Facebook stuff. We&#8217;re not going to dive into that too much. But on the show a couple of episodes ago, I talked with Kevin Tufts. He&#8217;s a product designer. He works&#8230;I think he works moreso on the Instagram side from what he mentioned to me. But when we had talked before, this was prior to the release of Threads, which is an Instagram app very similar to Twitter in that it&#8217;s sort of this microblogging platform that you can basically put out&#8230;I mean, I&#8217;m saying &#8220;tweets&#8221;, but you can put out these small posts. It&#8217;s connected in a way to Instagram in that you can share to and from things like that. And that just came out a couple of weeks ago. It&#8217;s had massive appeal. I think there&#8217;s up to 30 million plus people that joined within the first 24 hours or so. </p>
<p>Knowing that, what is the internal mood at Facebook like? Because Facebook has taken some knocks. They&#8217;ve had layoffs, there&#8217;s been the whole thing about the metaverse, et cetera. But now it seems like Facebook&#8217;s got like a win in the win column. Like, what&#8217;s it like there?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>You know, internally the feeling is really optimistic. There&#8217;s some really tangible excitement and that&#8217;s a really nice feeling, especially after how things have been in the tech industry lately. You can tell people are really excited and it&#8217;s awesome. So many people are trying it out themselves, wanting to test, wanting to dog food, kind of to make sure everything&#8217;s working as it should. So it feels really awesome to see that kind of excitement and it definitely is energizing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Does any of your work deal with Threads in any way?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Not so much. It&#8217;s mostly falling under Instagram, so they kind of do their thing. But there definitely are conversations, especially when it comes to inclusive design concepts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be really interested to see how Threads and these other similar services are going to play out in the market over the next few years. It&#8217;s not the first time that there have been a number of Twitter-like clones that have come out trying to unseat Twitter. And I think I mentioned this actually, I don&#8217;t know if I mentioned this on the show &#8212; I might have mentioned it a couple of episodes ago &#8212; but right around like 2006, 2007 when Twitter was starting to sort of come out of its quote-unquote &#8220;beta phase&#8221;, but it was becoming more popular and more well known. There were a number of other services that tried to compete for that same market share. There was Yammer. There was Pownce. Jaiku. Oh, God&#8230;it&#8217;s Plurk. That&#8217;s what it was. Plurk is another one. And they were all kind of trying to sort of compete for that same space of like &#8220;we also want to be a microblogging platform.&#8221; And this is prior to what people know of Twitter as now. This was 2007, because Twitter had pivoted from this podcasting startup. Actually, I don&#8217;t know if a lot of people know that it started out as this podcasting startup called Odeo &#8212; O-D-E-O &#8212; and then they pivoted into this sort of microblogging-esque platform around 2006. </p>
<p>So I&#8217;m just curious to see how they will fare because a lot of those services now got bought by bigger companies and then they shut them down or they&#8217;re just super popular in other countries and not so much here in the U.S. I know people are trying to migrate to Threads, migrate to BlueSky, migrate to Mastodon, et cetera. I&#8217;m still kind of taking a wait-and-see approach to see where the masses go or where the conversation &#8212; or really where the culture &#8212; ends up moving towards. I mean culture in a broader sense, not just like Black folks, but where the general Internet culture is going to migrate towards because it eventually will settle honestly into one place. Like it&#8217;s not going to be, I think as splintered as it is right now.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I hope that happens, you know, for the culture. I really do miss Black Twitter. That was amazing. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s still happening because I can&#8217;t see Twitter, but I would be really happy if everyone ended up kind of in the same space. That would really be ideal for me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, only time will tell. I think it&#8217;s way too early now for anyone to really be able to pontificate on who&#8217;s going to, quote unquote, win. Still a little early to tell.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, we can check back in in a bit and see where this all lands.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Speaking of that, Facebook&#8217;s coming up on its 20th anniversary next year. What do you think their place is now in this modern Internet age?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s an interesting thought. I definitely remember when Facebook became a thing, probably when I was in elementary school, high school maybe. It&#8217;s interesting to see how it&#8217;s progressed now, how the audience has kind of like grown and changed and shifted. I think Mark Zuckerberg has been really good. historically, he&#8217;s made a lot of good bets. Things are going really well. He&#8217;s invested in the right places. And I think going forward it&#8217;s still going to remain like a powerhouse. There are billions of users, there&#8217;s a really big international presence, and I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s necessarily going to change. My great aunt uses WhatsApp. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to change anytime soon, but I think we&#8217;ll definitely continue to see maybe things change, but I don&#8217;t really foresee it, I don&#8217;t know, going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that international presence is also, you know, there&#8217;s all these other products that are not just Facebook. You mentioned WhatsApp I know there&#8217;s different versions of Facebook in other countries like Facebook Lite, et cetera, and&#8230;it&#8217;s not the number one website in the world by accident. In some places, Facebook is the internet. So to kind guess, you know, prematurely call it dying. Like I&#8217;ve heard a lot, certainly here in the like Facebook&#8217;s everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s growing and changing. And I think Threads is a really big testament to the team being willing to kind of go where the audience needs them to grow with the audience and the base. So that&#8217;s pretty awesome to see.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, seeing that Facebook has that global footprint, let&#8217;s talk more about what you do in terms of accessibility. Can you kind of touch on how your work affects different products at Facebook?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>So I started out as a developer, like I mentioned before. Kind of fell into right out of school working on web accessibility, so finding accessibility issues, fixing them&#8230;, So when I say accessibility issues, I mean things like color contrast. If you go on a website and you can&#8217;t see the text because the color contrast is too low. Or visible focus indicators, if you&#8217;re pressing the Tab button to navigate through a form and you can&#8217;t see where your cursor is. So things like that eventually morphed into working on it from the product design angle. </p>
<p>But it&#8217;s been really energizing to come here and see that this is a focus area and be able to work on these parts of the app design system before they make it to people and starting at that stage. So there&#8217;s a small but passionate team working on that. And I kind of see my role on that team as coming from external places that talked about web accessibility and tried fixing it, working on it in multiple different ways. But these days one of the things I&#8217;m really most passionate about is inclusive design and specifically what intersectionality means in the context of all these things.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Talk about that a bit more.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. So I&#8217;ll tell you how I started thinking about that. </p>
<p>I worked at Shopify a few years ago, and while I was there, I wrote an article for the blog. I can&#8217;t really remember why it came to mind. Probably still the fallout of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protest in the U.S., but I was thinking a lot about what this means for accessibility. So there&#8217;s this awesome woman &#8212; she wrote this book called &#8220;Haben: The Deafblind Woman Who Conquered Harvard.&#8221; She was the first deafblind person to ever graduate from Harvard Law, which is a pretty massive deal, in part because before she started at Harvard Law, there were not materials that existed for a deafblind person to make it through the program. Right? Like, they didn&#8217;t have access to braille for all their materials. They didn&#8217;t have, necessarily maybe, interpreters&#8230;things like that. And she got through it. I was really touched by her story, but also her social media presence. She talks a lot about her experience as a deafblind woman who is of African descent. She made a post in particular talking about how when she interacts with other blind people, they almost always assume that she&#8217;s white. And that really got me thinking. Why is that? </p>
<p>It got me thinking, especially [as] someone who works in inclusive design about things like alternative text. So, you know, when you go on a website and the image is broken and you see a little bit of text, like dog, you see that text. If someone has put an alternative text attribute, which basically is what someone using something like a screen reader would hear, when their screen reader hits that image, they would hear whatever alternative text you put on it. If you put any. And oftentimes if a website even has alternative text, it&#8217;s very basic. Let&#8217;s say we go on a news website and there&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, a picture of a farmer. It might say farmer standing on a field, but it won&#8217;t really say anything about what the farmer looks like. Typically when we do that, I guess in a society where white is kind of the majority is seen as the default, you kind of implicitly are sending the message that this person is white, right? Yeah, it really got me thinking. </p>
<p>I noodled on that for a really long time, and I thought about my own experiences in elementary school. I was one of those kids who had begged to stay inside at recess, so I&#8217;d go to the library and read by myself. I read a lot of books, and I actually didn&#8217;t read a single book with a Black main character probably until middle school. And up until that point, I kid you not, I just assumed that people didn&#8217;t write books about Black people. It never even occurred to me that I just wasn&#8217;t coming across books with Black main characters for a reason. And so I was like, &#8220;okay, this is absolutely an accessibility issue.&#8221; Let&#8217;s write an article about it. </p>
<p>And I did, and initially actually, it&#8217;s a little bit controversial. It initially was not approved to be published, which was interesting, but eventually the editorial team was like, &#8220;okay, we&#8217;ll publish it.&#8221; But my one condition was, &#8220;okay, we cannot publish it during Black History Month.&#8221; I&#8217;m not going to publish this during Black History Month because I don&#8217;t want this to be like a topic that we relegate to Black History Month and never again. But I wrote that article, and it was the first time I&#8217;ve ever gotten hate mail. So believe it or not, some folks from the inclusive design community, I&#8217;m assuming it was those folks who were reading it, some people made fake email accounts and just, like, sent me hate mail. And I was like, &#8220;wow, this is kind of wild, kind of offensive.&#8221; But I&#8217;m like, you know what? If this is upsetting people to the extent where they&#8217;re sending me hate mail about it and telling me that race is irrelevant to people who are blind, then it means that I need to talk a lot more about it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, look, I can tell you, as someone that has done a podcast where I talk to Black designers, I can completely believe that you got sent hate mail because people are really shook by the acknowledgment of race. Like, what you&#8217;re saying is not pinpointing this on any specific person or people. You&#8217;re saying like, &#8220;this is a behavior that needs to be corrected for greater context.&#8221; And then people are sending you hate because you want clarification. It&#8217;s madness. But I can 100% believe that you got that, which I&#8217;m sorry to hear that you&#8217;ve gotten that, but unfortunately, I can believe it.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And I guess people had very strong reactions. But I guess working in accessibility, you kind of have these rose-colored glasses &#8212; or I did &#8212; thinking that, okay, this is a space where we&#8217;re talking about exclusion. We&#8217;re talking about people who are from marginalized groups. There absolutely should be a conversation about this. And I was really surprised that that conversation wasn&#8217;t necessarily welcome, which tells me that the folks who have the loudest voices in this community are maybe from one marginalized group, but aren&#8217;t seeing the intersection with others. Like the experience of a white woman who is blind is going to be very different from Black African immigrant who is blind, who is deafblind. And I think having more conversations about that is really important. But I&#8217;ve just really learned that for some reason, these conversations have not been at the forefront of the inclusive design movement. That tells me I need to talk about it more.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Do you think that it&#8217;s getting better?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m seeing enough conversations happen about it. The vast majority of people I know who work in inclusive design are white people. And I inherently&#8230;obviously the people who are going to talk about this issue the best are the people who&#8217;ve experienced it, right? So I think getting more Black folks in the inclusive design community will make it so that those conversations happen more often. But of course, people who don&#8217;t experience kind of what happens at these intersections of multiple marginalized identities, of course they can&#8217;t talk about it. They definitely shouldn&#8217;t be silencing us either.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Now, we&#8217;ve talked a lot about. Your work, what you&#8217;re doing at Facebook, et cetera. Let&#8217;s kind of shift gears and learn more about you as a person, as a designer. Tell me about where you grew up. Are you originally from Toronto?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. So I was born in Nigeria in a place called Il√©-If·∫πÃÄ, and I moved here when I was about four years old, and I&#8217;ve lived in the greater Toronto area, like, Toronto, the towns in and outside of it ever since. So I definitely feel very Canadian. But at the same time, I think a lot about my culture. I speak Yoruba. My parents speak Yoruba. To me, we&#8217;re immigrants, and it&#8217;s something that I think a lot about. Even though I think people often don&#8217;t read me as an immigrant, maybe because of my accent, I think it&#8217;s still a very important part of my identity.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Were you exposed to a lot of design and stuff growing up?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely not. I did not think this was a job, which is why I started out as a developer. I felt like that&#8217;s the closest I could get to making things online look nice. When I told my parents that I was going to do design, I think there was a bit of a freak out. My mom was like, &#8220;what are you going to design? Like, houses?&#8221; There definitely was a disconnect in what that meant. But yeah, it&#8217;s interesting what design actually means on the inside. It&#8217;s been really amazing, and I think there&#8217;s, like, nothing else I&#8217;d rather be doing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now you ended up going to the University of Toronto. Tell me about sort of, like, what your time was like there and whether it really kind of helped you once you got out there as a working designer.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I went to U of T for my undergrad. I studied psychology. U of T was the first university I kind of knew of in Toronto. There&#8217;s kind of this joke in the Nigerian community that U of T, for some reason, is like, the only university Nigerian people in Nigeria know about. So when I was little, my dad would take us there, take us to downtown, and he asked me once, when I was like, maybe five or six years old, :which university are you going to go to?&#8221; And I looked around and we were at U of T. So I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go to the University of Toronto.&#8221; And then I kind of did. </p>
<p>I think in my head I thought I would always go there because it&#8217;s just the one that I knew of. So that was really interesting. I learned so much studying psychology, and it&#8217;s probably very cliche because I know it&#8217;s, like, one of the most common undergrads that people take. But I learned so much about myself and the way that I look at the world in classes like sex roles and gender and cultural psychology, I just completely shifted my worldview. How I think of things, especially as an immigrant. When my parents and I argue, I look at it from a cultural psychology lens. Why are we arguing? It&#8217;s because our collectivistic versus individualistic outlooks on the world are colliding. So I think it definitely helped shift how I look at the world. And I think that&#8217;s been really important as a designer to not singularly look at things from this individualistic lens, but think of things from kind of how alternate cultures will look at things. And I think I definitely live in between two cultures, so maybe it makes it a little bit easier to shift my mindset.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And I would imagine, kind of with the work you&#8217;re doing with inclusive design and accessibility, that psychology background is probably super helpful.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to think so. I definitely try to look at it from that perspective. But ultimately, there&#8217;s so many different disabilities that people have, you&#8217;re never going to understand necessarily where all your users are coming from. So I try to, I don&#8217;t know, stay humble, try to not fall into that all-knowing designer kind of stereotype.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, I think at least it probably gives you some empathy into knowing what those kind of different disabilities would be. So tell me about your early sort of post grad career. I know you ended up working for Publicis Sapient as a product designer and as a developer, and you were there for a little over three years. Talk to me about what that experience was like.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yes. So after undergrad, I was like, okay, psychology is awesome, but what am I going to do now? And I kind of just went online trying to find interesting things to do, and I was like, oh, web development looks cool. I could do that. So I studied web development for a year at Humber, and then I started working at Sapient as a web developer. That was really interesting in that I worked mostly on websites, on the digital side of things, worked on a lot of different things. But it was also my first time working with designers, UX designers and visual designers. And I just kind of spent a lot of time working with them. I felt like they were kind of like my people. We talked a lot about how users might think about their perspectives, and I was like, I kind of want to do this. I feel like I could do this. Eventually, I convinced my very supportive director to let me kind of dabble in both, and eventually I moved over to UX.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, usually when I think about designers that are working at an ad agency &#8212; that&#8217;s what Sapient is &#8212; it&#8217;s moreso, like visual design or art director or creative director. But you were working on the development side. So they had, like an in-house team, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. So we&#8217;d work on different accounts, creating their websites or digital campaigns, like mini microsites and things like that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And you said this is your first time kind of working with UX designers and such; did that give you a greater sense of the type of work that you could be doing?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I had no idea that that job even existed. I think I always have loved creativity. I love art. I took art in grade eleven. Grade twelve. I took art as often as I could. I would go to art classes. But there was this one art class I took where the teacher told me I had no technical talent, and I kind of believed her. So for years&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I know, right? She was kind of right. But for years, I felt like I couldn&#8217;t even broach that world. I didn&#8217;t draw anymore. I didn&#8217;t paint anymore. I was never very good, but there were fun things to do outside of work. But for the first time, I saw design through a lens of not necessarily being making pretty things, but working on creating products and functional things that could exist in the real world, in the digital world. And I felt like I was more able to do that. I&#8217;m not going to be able to produce a beautiful oil painting rendering of you, but I can definitely design a landing page or a form. So I think that kind of work really appeals to me. It feels very logical in a way that appeals to me, but also creative in that you&#8217;re bringing together these elements in a way that kind of makes sense for your audience. But to me, it&#8217;s like the most creative job, even though you&#8217;re not necessarily making anything visually, like, groundbreaking or anything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now back then, were you focused on inclusive design and accessibility, or is that something which kind of came about later on in your career?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I think starting as a developer working on web accessibility, it definitely was the lens through which I always wanted to work in UX design, product design. And it was kind of how I made my case in that we didn&#8217;t have a lot of people who are specializing in accessibility, but even fewer who did that from the product design side of things. So I was able to make a case for that need on the team by working on things through that lens.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, after you were working at Sapient, you worked at Shopify for a while, which you kind of mentioned a bit earlier. Tell me about that experience. I&#8217;ve heard that their internal design culture there is really good. Is that what your experience was like?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I felt like their culture was really intentional, and it kind of presented design through a different lens for me. Yet again, that&#8217;s when I started thinking of design not only looking like building interfaces, but building your team, building very intentional relationships with your partners in product management, in development. Yeah, definitely very intentional. Definitely lots of process behind the way that things were done. It was a really nice way to broaden my horizons I feel it was a really good experience. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And from a design perspective, what sort of things were you working on there at Shopify?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>At Shopify, I specifically worked on Shopify Fulfillment Network, which &#8212; rest in peace &#8212; they had a recent round of layoffs, which is basically shedding that part of the company. But it was kind of their answer to Amazon Fulfillment. It was enabling merchants, small merchants, to ship out things from warehouses from centralized locations. And I felt like design was just taken very seriously there. </p>
<p>I was working on a project to build, like, a system for the warehouse. And so I started by requesting a visit to the warehouse because I had never visited a warehouse before. And so I went to a warehouse. I worked there for a couple of days, chatted with all the folks on the ground and yeah, got to experience the warehouse through their eyes, I guess. And then I went to start doing the design work, but it felt like they took it so seriously. They actually listened to me. They actually let me experience what I was designing for. And that was really cool. That&#8217;s still, I think, one of the most maybe interesting projects I&#8217;ve worked on. I feel like it was kind of like that seminal project that I worked on that made me officially a designer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I get what you&#8217;re saying. Yeah. Sometimes once you start to get that internal validation, or rather I would say, once you get that external validation from your team, that the work that you&#8217;re doing is making that impact, it does so much for morale. It does so much for sort of just building yourself up as a designer to know that you are making good decisions and that you&#8217;re doing good work.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. I guess it brought that aspect of maybe what I love about psychology, getting to understand other people into it. It wasn&#8217;t just sitting in a room and I guess making decisions from afar.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Now, you&#8217;re also currently working on a book about intersectionality and design, which we&#8217;ll get to. But before we talk about that, I&#8217;d love for you to kind of give your definition of inclusive design. What does it mean to you and why? Is it something that other designers should be sort of aware of as they work?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I think inclusive design to me is going beyond just compliance and following accessibility laws and making sure you&#8217;re up to code. It&#8217;s about truly designing for a variety of experiences to make a good experience for the variety of users that you have, whether that&#8217;s users with disabilities or users without disabilities, maybe users with temporary or situational disabilities. </p>
<p>But for me, specifically, bringing intersectionality into it is what I thought of a lot after know those few rounds of hate mail. I think that word is so often kind of divorced from where it initially came, intersectionality. Kimberl√© Crenshaw, like, that whole thing was about the multiple types of oppression that Black women experience, right? Like the misogyny and the racism, how does that intersect to create a unique social experience for Black women? Let&#8217;s pivot and look at accessibility in that same way. How does being disabled and being a Black person, being a brown person, being an immigrant, how do those things intersect to create a unique experience of disability, of exclusion, but kind of bringing Black folks back into that conversation? I&#8217;ve had experiences where I&#8217;ve seen people use the word intersectionality, and never do they even mention Kimberl√© Crenshaw or Black people, which I&#8217;m like&#8230;.that&#8217;s wild. That&#8217;s where the word came from. So I think we need to have those conversations. I think we need to acknowledge where this word came from, what the concept means. Kimberl√© Crenshaw&#8230;shout out to her. She is still making books. She&#8217;s still writing things. She&#8217;s still talking about this. We need to acknowledge where this term came from and what it actually means.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, how does this sort of factor into the work that you&#8217;re doing with your book? Is it kind of expounding on this in terms of design?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think what I&#8217;m hoping to do is have more conversations about this. Get people thinking about it, get people to understand that just like a lot of other places in tech in which we have kind of our dominant group in society, white men driving things, it&#8217;s the same thing in the disability movement right now, in the accessibility movement right now. And that needs to shift in order for the accessibility movement to truly be helpful for people who are not kind of the dominant societal group, right? People of color, immigrants are more likely to be disabled because of things like environmental racism, less access to essential health care. It absolutely is an important conversation to have because we make up so much of the body of disabled people in our countries.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I remember super early conversations around web accessibility back when I was &#8212; oh, God, I keep aging myself when I say these things &#8212; back when I was designing websites in 2005, and even just trying to advocate for alt text on images and being told that, &#8220;oh, well, that&#8217;s only for disabled people and they&#8217;re not really using the web and stuff like that.&#8221; And I know that a lot of the technology around accessibility has increased, especially as browsers have gotten better. but I remember when it was just like pulling teeth to get people to even consider accessibility when it came to their work. They just wanted to make interesting, cool stuff online and didn&#8217;t think about anybody, but just impressing, I don&#8217;t know, other designers or friends of theirs, not thinking about who the people were that could possibly be using the thing that you&#8217;re designing.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, and I think in some circles that&#8217;s still the situation, unfortunately. But I think a lot of people maybe don&#8217;t know people who are disabled or like a lot of folks don&#8217;t maybe or didn&#8217;t know people who are Black in the past and that kind of painted their worldview on who Black people are. But if you know people who are disabled like anyone else, people who are disabled just want to have their independence and be able to do things that everyone else does. So if we don&#8217;t make our banking website accessible, the consequence of that is&#8230;the real world consequence is that someone out there needs to trust a third party to handle their money, and that&#8217;s not really a situation that would be acceptable to anyone else. So why should we subject disabled people to that experience? </p>
<p>I definitely think that things like laws and getting sued and lawsuits are a big reason why people are starting to care. Companies are starting to care, net-net honestly, if that&#8217;s what gets them to make their websites accessible, that&#8217;s fine with me. Be nice if it came from a place of &#8220;this is what&#8217;s right,&#8221; but if it&#8217;s going to come from the law, that&#8217;s cool too.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I totally agree with that. Having that accountability is unfortunately the only way that some companies are going to make that happen. Like they have to be fined or otherwise censured in order for them to actually take it seriously.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. And if that&#8217;s what gets us where we need to be and having the right conversations, I can live with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a book on inclusive design written by Regin√© Gilbert. She&#8217;s been on the show a few times actually, who wrote &#8220;Inclusive Design for a Digital World&#8221;. Really great book. If people are listening and they want to just learn more about this, they should check that out. But I&#8217;m super interested in seeing what your book is going to be like when it comes out because I think definitely what you mentioned with intersectionality and race as it relates to design is something that is still super important, especially during this current &#8212; I guess you could say in the U.S. &#8212; this current political climate. But I think it&#8217;s probably worldwide or starting to become worldwide as it relates to things like critical race theory and things like that, where things are being either rewritten or omitted that just leave race out of it or completely rewrite history in some odd ways. So I&#8217;m really going to be interested to see the reception that your book gets once it&#8217;s out.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I am interested in seeing myself finish writing it. I&#8217;ll definitely keep you posted. I&#8217;m excited to have this conversation; hopefully get less hate mail this time. But yeah, the fact that people have reacted so strongly to conversations about that tells me that we need to have more of those conversations and it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re not talking about enough right now. But we definitely have folks who are starting to build that conversation. So I&#8217;m excited to join the chat.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So between your product design work that you&#8217;re doing at Meta, you&#8217;re writing this book, I think you also mentioned a bit earlier that you&#8217;re in another educational program. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s right. So I&#8217;m starting a Masters of Inclusive Design program at OCAD U. So kind of a funny name, but Ontario College of Art and Design&#8230;University? It recently became a university. I&#8217;m so so excited about that. It&#8217;s a really small program, but it&#8217;s been really foundational in the accessibility and inclusive design community. And I&#8217;m excited to be surrounded by people who&#8217;ve done a lot of thought in this area and just to absorb their knowledge and learn from them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I know Dr. Dori Tunstall was the dean there. She just came out with a book recently called &#8220;Decolonizing Design&#8221;, but I think she recently stepped down. And there&#8217;s another Black woman or BIPOC woman that&#8217;s stepping up as dean, I think.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, Dori&#8217;s amazing. I ran into her on the street in Toronto once and I talked to her for a while and she was super nice, and I was like, a weirdo. But she played a huge part in the creation of this program, actually, and in making it actually truly inclusive. This program has, like, remote and asynchronous options. It has options for folks who have to work while doing the program. And I&#8217;ve never really come across a program quite like that. So when Dori says inclusive design, Dori means inclusive design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s awesome. Yeah, I had her on the show back in&#8230;oh God, 2015. Maybe she&#8217;s like episode 107 or something like that. At the time, she was still teaching in Australia. She was still teaching at Swinburne. This is before she came back to North America. So it&#8217;s been amazing to see just her glow up and change and really how fiercely she&#8217;s advocated for decolonizing design and inclusivity in her work. It&#8217;s been really a powerful thing to see.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And it&#8217;s one thing to say it, but actually doing it and creating a course that&#8217;s actually centered around being inclusive and providing multiple ways of learning where you&#8217;re able to codesign your education, that&#8217;s just walking the walk. And I really admire that. I never come across another higher education program like that, and I hope other programs take note and we can see more options for inclusive education.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So, Tolu, what does your downtime look like? I mean, I imagine a lot of this work takes up a lot of just, like, brain space and things like that. What do you do in your downtime?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on that. I feel like I&#8217;ve been called by people in my life a bit of a workaholic, and I&#8217;m trying to just find hobbies that do not necessarily relate to my work. I&#8217;ve been doing some photography lately, which is fun. I really love plants. Trying to spend more time outside, but also watching movies, shows. Again, I feel like you really can&#8217;t unsee inclusive design. Right now. I&#8217;m watching &#8220;I&#8217;m A Virgo&#8221; about a 13 foot tall Black man from Oakland trying to find his way in the world. So, yeah, I really enjoy things like that. I need to get out more. But I love movies. I love film.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I need to catch &#8220;I&#8217;m A Virgo.&#8221; I know it just came out, I think last month &#8212; we&#8217;re recording in July. This will air in September. But I think it came out like June-ish something like that. I need to check it out because I&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s really good.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never seen anything like it. It&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What are some pieces of advice that you kind of find yourself coming back to? This could be, like, life advice, career advice, et cetera.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>This sounds kind of silly, but I say this. I think this is a quote from Winston Churchill, who is otherwise very problematic, but &#8220;when you&#8217;re going through hell, keep going.&#8221; Honestly, whenever something weird happens, something demotivating happens, I just think of that and I find it incredibly motivating. If you&#8217;re in hell, why would you stop there? You got to keep going so you at least move yourself out of hell. I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m in hell, but I find that quote really motivating and I think of it often.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Who are some of the mentors that have kind of helped you out in your career? And these could be peers as well, but who are some people that have really kind of helped you to get to where you are today?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Oh, my gosh. Basically everyone you&#8217;ve talked to on this podcast. But I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to have some really amazing mentors in my time. The person who I worked with at my first company, Allison Walton, who got me started in web accessibility, amazing mentor. Zoltan Hawryluk, who I worked with as a developer, I got to dip some of him once a month. Just people who have been in the industry for a really long time have taught me so much. Tory Hargro, who works at Meta, has been such an incredible mentor to me. He&#8217;s amazing and he&#8217;s so accessible, even at his level, which is amazing. I work with a designer called Alexis Cotton, who has just been an incredible mentor to me. I&#8217;ve learned so much from her about how to show up. She&#8217;s a really unique and interesting person, and I feel really lucky to have access to all these people who have made themselves so available. And, yeah, it&#8217;s very humbling, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be doing the things I&#8217;m doing now if it wasn&#8217;t for those folks.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to text Tory and I&#8217;m going to let him know that I talked to you for the show. When you think back on your career and sort of what you&#8217;ve learned to get to this point, and I think you may have somewhat answered this earlier, but what are you still working on unlearning as you grow as a designer?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to unlearn that kind of being a wallflower, being humble, minimizing and shrinking myself to be palatable. I think it&#8217;s going to be a long process of unlearning. But, yeah, I&#8217;m trying to just show up more. I look around at my peers and kind of how they show up in rooms and how they take up space, and I&#8217;m like, I should take up that space too. And I think a lot of women struggle with this in general, but I want to take up more space, and I want to show up as that person who yeah. Who just puts themselves out there and doesn&#8217;t need to shrink themselves to make a version of them that they feel like is palatable to the people around them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Do you have like, a dream project or something that you&#8217;d love to work on one day?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Honestly, I can&#8217;t even think of one off the top of my head. My dream project is talking about inclusive design and intersectionality and where Black people, where people of color, where immigrants fit into this design story.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, as you look kind of into the future, of course, like you said, you&#8217;re still working on this book, you&#8217;re in this program. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? Like, what does Tolu in 2028 going to be doing?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I see myself deleting a lot of hate mail.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Hopefully more than that. Hopefully more than that.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>I see myself having more conversations about these things, about it becoming more of a mainstream conversation. I think in the larger tech community, we&#8217;re definitely at the point where we&#8217;re talking about needing more diverse representation. I&#8217;m really hoping we can talk about that in the inclusive design community as well. I see myself growing, helping other folks in the way people have helped me. It&#8217;s funny you mentioned that. I feel like ever since the pandemic, I&#8217;ve learned to think a lot more short term back then. Couldn&#8217;t even plan, like, two weeks ahead. And so right now I&#8217;m focusing a lot more on what&#8217;s on my plate.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Look, I&#8217;m right there with you. People ask me now about stuff to do in October, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;do I want to do that in October? Where am I going to be in October?&#8221; So I think we&#8217;re all, in a lot of ways, still kind of trying to come out of this pandemic and think about the future. But it feels like with what you&#8217;re doing, your path is set. It feels like if you keep on this path now of working on inclusive design, I think you&#8217;ve got a bright future ahead. Especially as we look at things like Web3, the metaverse, other social media platforms, things of that nature. There&#8217;s just going to be more and more opportunities because the Web is expanding in a way to include everyone that it just hasn&#8217;t before. Because technology is changing.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, there&#8217;s a new frontier. There&#8217;s the Wild West, where no one has ever done these things before. And there&#8217;s definitely a lot of conversations to be had about how to make these completely new things inclusive and accessible. I definitely am super excited about the people who are around me at Meta. There&#8217;s actually surprisingly a huge number of Black folks at Meta now, kind of starting with Tory. I think he was actually the first Black designer on Facebook, which is pretty wild. But I definitely look around work and I feel like there are the right people around to help on that path, the right mentors, and that feels really awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, just to wrap things up here, where can our audience find out more information about you and your work? Where can they find you online?</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>My website is tolu.xyz. Tolu is T-O-L-U. My Threads handle/Instagram is the same &#8212; tolu.xyz. Email. I&#8217;m also on LinkedIn. You can&#8217;t find me really anywhere else. I&#8217;m trying to reduce the amount of things that I consume, so those are probably the best ways to find me. Also via email. Old-fashioned.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, you also have the distinction of being the first person on the show to mention that they can be found on Threads.</p>
<p><b>Tolu Adegbite:</b></p>
<p>That feels pretty awesome. Hopefully future guests will follow that trend.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, Tolu, it&#8217;s been such a pleasure to have you on the show. So great to learn more about you and about your you know, like I said, the web is expanding in many different, know, virtual reality, et cetera, and the work that you&#8217;re doing just speaks to the greater need to include everyone in the conversation. So I really hope that with the work that you&#8217;re doing that we are all moving forward and closer to fulfilling that goal. So thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
