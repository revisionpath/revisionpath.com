Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<p>Artificial intelligence has been a running theme on the podcast this year, and I couldn&#8217;t think of a better person to talk shop about this with than the one and only Carl Bogan. Through his studio, <a href="https://mystergiraffe.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Myster Giraffe</a>, he&#8217;s created viral mashups that have racked up millions of views across social media.</p>
<p>Carl spoke a bit about his experiences as a visual effects artist, and then we went into a deep discussion about all things synthetic media &#8212; generative AI, deepfakes, media literacy, government regulations&#8230;you name it. But we didn&#8217;t just geek out about that! Carl told his story about how he got interested in visual effects, what motivates him, and where he wants his work to go in the future. This episode will definitely give you some food for thought!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>My name is Carl Bogan, and I am a digital creator and VFX professional living in Los Angeles.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>How&#8217;s 2023 been treating you so far?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>2023 is&#8230;every year is a bit different. This one is no different from that. Starting out, very interestingly, more inbounds from Myster Giraffe. The VFX industry is a bit slow right now. The strike isn&#8217;t making it much better, but of course, always optimistic, looking for new opportunities in every single direction.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ve been hearing from friends of mine in L.A. and other folks in the entertainment industry how the strike is kind of&#8230;I guess it&#8217;s reverberating throughout the industry. Because it&#8217;s one thing when the writers are striking, but then that affects production, it affects actors, et cetera. So, yeah, I mean, we&#8217;re recording this now as the strike is going on. I have a feeling it might still be going on by the time this airs. Given that, what plans do you have for the summer?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Lots of family traveling time, creating new projects, coming up with new ideas, new ways to create new ways to engage with people. And so sort of never stop creating is one of my mottos. So the strike doesn&#8217;t really stop that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Is there anything in particular that you want to try to launch by the end of the year?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m still working on a list. I have a long list, I&#8217;m turning into a short list, but Myster Giraffe is always sort of near the top of that list. It tends to act as a calling card in general, and so I keep creating every &#8212; I don&#8217;t know &#8212; every six weeks or so, maybe every eight weeks of a new piece in order to keep the beach ball in the air.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, you&#8217;ve mentioned Myster Giraffe a couple of times now, and I think listeners have probably seen your work a lot on social media. If not, I&#8217;ll make sure to link to a couple of clips in the show notes. But yeah, talk to me about Myster Giraffe. Like, I&#8217;m really curious on where that name came from.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>So Myster Giraffe is an online handle I created in April of 2019 as a way of honing my deepfake skills in a world that was very much pre-deepfake, generally speaking. And so the name Myster Giraffe was sort of a flippant reaction to wanting to put something out there, seeing if it had any value, and so it just sort of stuck after the first video went very viral. So now I was married to it, so it didn&#8217;t matter if I didn&#8217;t like it or not at that point.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>But I do like it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&#8217;s a pretty unique name, Myster Giraffe. And also, I guess the spelling of it probably also calls into a bit of mystery as well.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Now, that was on purpose, namely because Myster Giraffe was born out of not seeing any&#8230;I had seen deepfakes to date at that point, but not any deepfakes that I could identify with in terms of Black culture or pop culture. And so I wanted to be that voice, but at the same time, knowing that history has told me, for good or bad or indifferent, you can be marginalized as a Black creator. If you show your work and then put yourself next to your work, the work may not stand by itself. So the M-Y-S &#8212; the mystery in Myster Giraffe &#8212; the goal was to be sort of more of a Banksy character, and that did work for many, many years and it really stoked the interest of many media outlets and people. Like, I wanted the work to stand by itself instead of having to say, &#8220;oh, well, that&#8217;s good for a Black creator,&#8221; or for that, sometimes people can put an asterisk next to your accomplishment.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, brother, you do not have to tell me about that. I know that all too well. I mean, it&#8217;s one thing&#8230;yeah, you put your face or your likeness or something next to it, and then people will automatically kind of either discount it or buy into it. But when I was doing the Black Weblog Awards back in&#8230;I did that from 2005 to 2011. And even though it was, like, gaining notoriety, like NPR had reported on it, et cetera, I knew that people would not even pay attention to it just because it had &#8220;Black&#8221; in the name. Like, it would just go in one ear and out the other. And that was also when Obama was running, and so everything was post-racial. So if you mention anything with &#8220;Black&#8221; in it, you must be racist. So I know that feeling all too well and kind of being able to stand behind a bit of a pseudonym or just to kind of obfuscate your personal self from the work helps the work stand out on its own.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. Not to mention, I was thinking about having a clear delineation between me and Myster Giraffe, in case I get into a bit of trouble. You know, deepfakes are still sort of new, and so I didn&#8217;t know what I would create that may or may not get me in hot water. So I wanted to be able to put up a firewall just in case. So I can go get a sandwich and not get attacked.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting you say that, because I thought about that as I was looking at some of the clips, and one of the last clips that I remember seeing from Myster Giraffe was &#8212; you probably know the one I&#8217;m talking about &#8212; is Jonathan Majors and Michael B. Jordan, you know, doing the Dennis Edwards and Siedah Garrett, you know, &#8220;Don&#8217;t Look Any Further&#8221;. And I think that came out and then maybe it was like the next month or so, those allegations about Jonathan Majors dropped, and it was like, ohhhh.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Mm-hmm. You never know.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. And it was in that media time where he and Michael B. Jordan were doing a lot of press together for Creed III and everything, and people were kind of speculating on their friendship or their bromance or what have you, and then that happens, and&#8230;yeah. I get what you&#8217;re saying. I get what you&#8217;re saying.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Yes. You can&#8217;t always control the narratives when they leave your mouse click.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. You mentioned wanting to do the studio to kind of hone your talent, but what was the other inspirations behind starting your own studio?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>When I first started doing Myster Giraffe, I got a lot of inbounds from different people who wanted to work with me. This is even before I was really ready for the attention. I had been in freelance visual effects for maybe fifteen years at that point, so I was very familiar with freelance work. And so the demand kept growing and growing and growing and growing and working more and more brands, more and more music artists. And so it just made sense to launch an entire effort in order to take advantage of the inbounds.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay, so just sort of have one place to kind of funnel everything into.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Sort of. That&#8217;s correct.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Now, do you have a team that you work with or is it just you?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Generally? It&#8217;s just me, unless thee job is too big and I need to scale it. And so if I have to do production onsite, I have to scale the team. I have people I go to and I hire, and we work very well together. Friends of mine, colleagues of mine. But for the most part, the Myster Giraffes online as far as the social media effort, that&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay. How do you come up with the ideas? I think some of them probably certainly are just inspired by, of course, Black culture. A lot of them are. But like&#8230;Steve Harvey as Megan Thee Stallion? Where do these ideas come from?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>There&#8217;s an instinct that only shows up during certain times. There&#8217;s maybe about 10 out of the 40 that I&#8217;ve created, I think around 40 or so, that I knew what they were going to do before they did it because there&#8217;s a little tickle that you get. There&#8217;s a little sort of&#8230;where you can&#8217;t stop giggling. You&#8217;re working on it and you watch it 37 times and you&#8217;re saying, &#8220;this is a good one. This is really good.&#8221; So I allow myself time in between creations. That way I don&#8217;t wear that muscle out. I wanted to always be able to recognize the funny before it shows up. Some of them I do them for me. Some of them I do as an experiment. Some of them I do as tributes. But there is a certain section that I have an idea for what&#8217;s going to work well within the demographic that I&#8217;ve sort of created or taken home in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, some of them certainly are really fun. I mean, they&#8217;re all fun. I don&#8217;t want to say some of them aren&#8217;t, but I think the one that really sort of stuck out to me and I was like &#8220;wait a minute, who is this?&#8221; I think it was one for Insecure&#8230;for the HBO show. And Issa Rae singing Luther Vandross.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of my favorites. Well, because that one&#8217;s fun. So what normally I like to do when I first started out, it was a bit more cheeky. Man over woman, big difference over here, big difference over there, chasm in the middle. That&#8217;s where the joke is. But then pretty quickly I realized, &#8220;oh, you can really tell stories with this and sort of come up with alternate realities.&#8221; So that was before the term metaverse had really &#8212; or multiverse had really &#8212;  sort of come to fruition. And so I had the idea of Rick and Morty&#8217;s intergalactic cable mixed with what Myster Giraffe sort of became. And so each of these sort of are their own reality and their own channel in a multiverse somewhere existing in simultaneous fashion. And so that one was all about the love triangle between Issa and their two male interests on thee show. And so it lines up with the lyrics of the song. Who doesn&#8217;t love that song? It&#8217;s an iconic song. Who doesn&#8217;t love Issa Rae? She&#8217;s fantastic. And so you put them together, you cut a trailer around it to help the story get sticky and then you put it out.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now when you put that out, was it for HBO and the show, or were you just doing it just to release it through the studio?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>That was spec, but I wanted it to look as if it was commissioned because why not? I have no doubt in my mind they would have commissioned it or asked to repost it had it not been a day before they launched the next season. I just kind of got to it late because I don&#8217;t rush through these things. It&#8217;s like, oh, let me sit down, I&#8217;m ready to create again. And so Luther Vandross actually reposted the video &#8212; or rather his team &#8212; and most people from the show reposted it minus Issa. I&#8217;m not sure if she liked or she didn&#8217;t. I guess that&#8217;s not really the point. It&#8217;s to make art that I like and then see if others can appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. What does the process look like when you&#8217;re working on a new project? Like, you have an idea for one of these deepfake videos, or if it&#8217;s something from a client, like, what&#8217;s the process behind going from idea to conception?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>I would say if it&#8217;s for me, the process is 80% concept and that is a very passive process initially, whether that&#8217;s daily Twitter usage or Instagram usage or TikTok usage. It&#8217;s a sort of&#8230;collecting things, collecting daily life into your brain. And then I sit down when I&#8217;m ready to create. I just kind of feel like, you know what, I&#8217;m ready. I sit down and it takes about three to four hours of just kind of going through, combing through what I want to say. I think&#8230; I want to have an idea. I think I want to do something with 70s African-American hair care products. I think I want to use this person. This person&#8217;s sort of been of the zeitgeist lately. Let me see if I can work them in. And so I kind of have this rolling list of people and topics in my head over in between the pieces. So then when I sit down, that three or four hours, I march, march, march, march, march and then I eventually end at a singular point which is a video. And then I back into it. So I always choose a person second. So I always choose the video first. It&#8217;s easier, I found, to not have to force a person into a place. So the people&#8230;if I wanted to do a person right now, I wouldn&#8217;t really be able to because I haven&#8217;t found the piece of media that fits yet. So finding the media is much harder than finding the subject. But if it is a studio, they normally come with thee concept [of] what they want to do. So that&#8217;s the easy part. Then they say, okay, great, they have an idea. I&#8217;ll either go on set and VFX supe it to make sure they&#8217;re shooting it correctly, because there&#8217;s a lot of things you can get wrong. We do a data collection of the person that you want to put in what they just shot, you know, we use a stand in. And so I&#8217;ve also created a very unique process of data collection for the subject. So that takes about half an hour, maybe 45 minutes, and then I take all the data back to my workstation, my home office, and I make a data set of the data. I get the plates from the studio and it takes about an hour to pre-process everything. And then I start training. It takes about a day and a half or two days. Then the compositing takes about a week, depending on how long and short it is, how perfect they want to be, how much they&#8217;re paying me to be perfect. So for the Myster Giraffe stuff, I purposefully don&#8217;t spend more than a day on the compositing because it&#8217;s not about how perfect it is, it&#8217;s about the story that it&#8217;s telling. If I do that, I&#8217;ll never get done because of my VFX background. I know too much in order to make it take less time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s about it. That&#8217;s sort of the broad strokes.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So it sounds like with Myster Giraffe, at least for your self initiated stuff, you kind of want to be a little bit more and this is not a diss by saying this, but it&#8217;s kind of rough and dirty, like you want to go ahead and get it and get it out there and get a reaction from people.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. I didn&#8217;t want to chase the pixel perfect deepfakes that some people chase, which is fine. I want them to push the technology forward. But I also realized, like I said, from being in visual effects, the goal is to have it be so good it disappears. Good VFX are invisible. And so since putting different faces on purpose, on different people, the goal is to create cognitive dissonance. So being perfect there is sort of working backwards. And so I do a good job of blending skin tones, face sizing matting and masking around the faces. Yada, yada, yada. So I get a lot of praise on how well integrated they look, but nothing past that because if they can&#8217;t see the job that I&#8217;ve done for this particular world, then I think it goes against the work that I&#8217;m doing. So sometimes I see an error and I just leave it in.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s not worth the three hours to fix it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Right. I&#8217;m curious also&#8230;when you put it out I&#8217;m imagining people aren&#8217;t coming back to you saying &#8220;oh, between this timestamp and this timestamp it&#8217;s a little off&#8221; or something. They just like the concept.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Correct. I have yet to hear anyone complain about the compositing or the face generation because the story generative is so enthralling that it doesn&#8217;t really matter that it&#8217;s not 100% perfect. I will take 85 to 90 for this since it&#8217;s just for social media.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And I think that&#8217;s probably just an important thing that creatives listening can kind of apply to their own work. Like don&#8217;t let perfect get in the way of good. I don&#8217;t know how that saying goes. It&#8217;s something like that. But done is better than&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Done is better than perfect.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Done is better than perfect. Thank you. Because you can spend a lot of time trying to get something to what you think is perfect. But the reality is that once it&#8217;s out there in the world, the person that sees it already thinks it&#8217;s perfect as it is. I mean there&#8217;s going to be some that will scrutinize, but for the most part, just put it out there and get feedback. You can always iterate on your own time but don&#8217;t let that stop you from releasing the thing, you know?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. Put the work out. Don&#8217;t worry about it. You can always go back and fix it, but put the work out. I remember the very first one that I did &#8212; very first piece was a Will Smith and Cardi B that he ended up reposting. I&#8217;m going to believe, to date, it&#8217;s still the third highest viewed post on his social media account. And I remember getting ready to really get granular and get into each pixel, make sure it&#8217;s perfect. And I stopped myself and said &#8220;you know what, this is good enough.&#8221; And I know sometimes you hear that, oh, &#8220;good enough is never good enough.&#8221; Sometimes it is. Sometimes it is good enough depending on the place you&#8217;re sending it and what you want to use it for and the time that you have and the effort that you have. And so I would say that examine that before you really spend a lot of time on something that may not matter in that context.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&#8217;s good advice. Now you&#8217;re working in&#8230;the area that you&#8217;re working in is known kind of generally as synthetic media, which I feel like is the talk of the tech industry these days. Generative AI, personalized media, deepfakes, like you said, with some of the social clips that you&#8217;ve done. And I&#8217;m sure that you&#8217;ve got thoughts on all of this. So I do have some questions. I&#8217;d like for us to chop it up a little bit and talk about some of this stuff. Now, the most obvious thing is synthetic media has the potential to kind of blur the line between what&#8217;s real and what&#8217;s fake. When you&#8217;re working with synthetic media, are there sort of ethical considerations that you think are completely essential for doing this work? Like, when a project comes in or when you&#8217;re working on your own project, what are sort of the ethical considerations that you have around creating something?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>So I will start with saying deepfake porn is a scourge on society, and they need to legislate that into the ground. It&#8217;s not okay. And I say that because that&#8217;s where all of this started. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>I say a lot of the tech industry is born from video games and porn. Well, this is no different. And actually, as quiet as it&#8217;s kept, a lot of creators would use a forum on a deepfake porn site because that&#8217;s where all of the information was on how to do this, how to do that. It was sort of an oddly placed forum in sort of a deep, dark place on the Internet. Sort of, I would imagine, in the same way that YouTube was created and how to get compression rates down and so on and so forth. So I don&#8217;t know how it still exists. I won&#8217;t list the website because it&#8217;s not important. But the sites that do indulge in that practice, I think they should be held to a much higher standard and shut down, so to speak. Because permission and consent in synthetic media is extremely important. Which is exactly why I and many other creators do not do work or use anyone&#8217;s likeness for money where they did not consent to it. And so if someone came to me and said, right now, &#8220;hey, I want you to put Steve Harvey in a commercial, I&#8217;ll pay you money,&#8221; I have to say no, because I did not get Steve Harvey&#8217;s permission to do that. And so when it&#8217;s all fun and games on the Internet, I&#8217;m not getting paid for it. It&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s parody. As soon as you take money for it, it steps outside of parody and it&#8217;s paid for hire. And now you&#8217;re infringing on his likeness. Now, that being said, here&#8217;s where it gets tricky. You take Steve Harvey&#8217;s likeness, you put it into the machine, it turns those pixels into numbers. The numbers turns into whatever goes into the latent space of the training, and it spits out something that looks like Steve Harvey, but legally, is it Steve Harvey? Because I always ask sort of this thought experiment: if you have two twin brothers who are identical, one is a senator and one does pornography, what happens? It hadn&#8217;t happened yet. But is the twin brother who is in pornography, is he allowed to practice his pornography as well as next to his brother who&#8217;s running for Senate? And so that&#8217;s sort of, at least from where I&#8217;m standing &#8212; how do you handle likeness and what [someone then] does with something that looks like you, right? And so we&#8217;re kind of reaching this grey space of what to do with that and I don&#8217;t think anyone really has the answer right now. But I will say that having ownness over your likeness, not in the way that it has been done for the last 20 or 30 years, but in a new way&#8230;that hasn&#8217;t yet been created, I believe that&#8217;s going to become very important.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Last year, right around this time, I was working with a startup. We were doing a magazine and we were doing this issue on Web3 and it was really like my first time diving into, in a deep sense, learning about a lot of these issues. And it was amazing. Like, just hearing about the concept of digital twins and people considering licensing or putting some sort of restrictions around their voice, because someone could take like&#8230;someone could take this podcast and the hours of audio that I&#8217;ve done and put that into some type of, I don&#8217;t know, whatever sort of generative AI type of thing and spit out something that I&#8217;ve never said, but they&#8217;ve cobbled it together from the words that I&#8217;ve said over the years and stuff like that. It was fascinating in like a Black Mirror sci-fi kind of way. But I could see there being some really heinous implications if that is used for nefarious purposes.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Five years ago I was talking to several generative audio companies, and none of them were really that good, if I&#8217;m just being honest. But something happened the last six months, because in AI, six months is like six years. And now, all of a sudden, from this one podcast, my voice can be cloned. Your voice can be cloned. And we can be singing Frank Sinatra or saying really inflammatory things about different races and cultures. And so where is it going to be in six months from now? I don&#8217;t know. But I will say the technology is allowing for less data to do better impressions visually and audio wise. The future of that I believe is going to&#8230;someone&#8217;s going to come out with a way to identify or there&#8217;s going to be some protocol that everyone&#8217;s going to have to adopt if they want to seem as if they are with the time. Sort of like the Truth campaign which got rid of a lot of smokers or stopped a lot of people from smoking. It was a social movement and if you were seen smoking, you were seen as sort of a disgusting act. And because of that, many people do not smoke. And I don&#8217;t think the Truth campaign or the Truth company get enough credit for doing that, but I believe it&#8217;s going to take that sort of social movement in order to prevent people from being ripped off. Or I think you&#8217;ve heard of the kidnap scam where people take your voice and they say, &#8220;oh we have Maurice. Maurice, say something.&#8221; And you&#8217;ll say, &#8220;help me, help me give them whatever they want,&#8221; just that little bit. And it triggers your family to then go into their banks and their coffers and pull out whatever money they have to satisfy the demands of the would be kidnappers. But little do they know you&#8217;re just on vacation in Hawai&#8217;i.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>And so that is a real thing that will also happen. And not to be too dystopian or anything, there&#8217;s so many other good things that are going to happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. </p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>But these are just the immediate things that are sort of the low hanging fruit. Especially because we&#8217;ve been in the media lately and we&#8217;re making tools and we&#8217;re using tools but we&#8217;re not really getting ahead of them fast enough. But not necessarily saying that these things will happen, it&#8217;s just that they can happen. But oftentimes things that can happen will happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s true. That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>I forgot. Is it? Occam&#8217;s Razor. No, I think it&#8217;s something it&#8217;s one of the laws.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably like Murphy&#8217;s Law or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Murphy&#8217;s Law. That&#8217;s what you have. Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, to that point, you know, you&#8217;re right. I mean, I even think about, you know, some technology that we have now that we take for granted, like cell phones and things like that. Those were inspired by science fiction. So you kind of have this interesting, almost symbiotic relationship of how the technology can be influenced by fiction and then that ends up influencing what people actually do with it in real life. It&#8217;s a weird sort of process and I think you&#8217;re right; it is going to have to get to some point where there&#8217;s some type of protocol or regulation. I know the government has been talking to Sam Altman from OpenAI about artificial intelligence and how it can be used. So I can see the government trying to put some guardrails around this. But in the meantime, what do you think? Actually before we do that &#8212; side note, you mentioned Truth. I was on a Truth street team in 1999.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Thank you for your service.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>No, you mentioned that and I was like is the Truth campaign still a thing? It&#8217;s still a thing. It&#8217;s been around for 25 years. Damn.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Now little did we know that they would go from cigarettes to vaping which I think depending who you ask is better or worse. But at least we don&#8217;t have to smell it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>So maybe that was the goal. I&#8217;m not entirely sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>But to go back to that whole thing about protocol in the meantime, what do you think we can do to sort of cultivate some literacy or some critical thinking around how folks can sort of, I guess, navigate and discern between what&#8217;s synthetic media and what&#8217;s authentic media? Like we&#8217;re already starting to see political campaign ads use kind of this generative video or generative AI for some things of course. I think probably earlier this year you were starting to see people do those AI avatars and stuff like that. And I know one way that people were sort of saying, like, &#8220;oh, well, you can tell this is fake. Look at the hands, because they could never get the hands right.&#8221; But now they&#8217;re starting to get a little better with the hands. But in the meantime, until this sort of protocol is implemented, how can people start to spot the fake, I guess?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Well, for video, it&#8217;s easier right now. So for fully generated, like, prompted video, the data is not there. The computational math hasn&#8217;t really been done yet on the full models to make them fully realistic. Yet six months ago, it was much worse. Six months later, it&#8217;s much better. Six months, it&#8217;ll be even better. And two years from now, it&#8217;ll be almost impossible to tell. Sort of like Unreal Engine. And they got really, really good at generating rock formations and trees and landscapes because they&#8217;re using scans of actual rocks and trees and landscapes. Science plus computing power plus data equals reality, essentially.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>And so eventually, we won&#8217;t be able to tell. And so I actually work with a larger group put on by MIT. It&#8217;s sort of like a disinformation panel of people all around the world, and we get on a call once or twice a year. We talk about where things are, what can we do to help usher in a safer future, a more honest future, and a more ethical future for everyone, so that we don&#8217;t end up in a Black Mirror episode, which we&#8217;re rapidly racing towards. And so one of the easiest things, I believe, that always comes up is just an identifier, whether that&#8217;s a logo or a bug in the bottom right corner or somewhere on the screen that lets you know what you&#8217;re looking at has been generated. That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s nothing terribly difficult to do, but there just has to be one commission or one protocol that everyone signs up for says, you know what? I&#8217;m going to be a part of the winning team in terms of wanting to make sure that disinformation is not spread, whether that&#8217;s innocent or whether it is really damaging. There was a person who went to the Met Gala. Allegedly, she wasn&#8217;t there. Someone posted her in a beautiful gown on thee red carpet, and she was at home in her pajamas, so that&#8217;s not a big deal. But then you see, like, you&#8217;re saying, the political information where you see Trump kissing Fauci.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>And that&#8217;s a big deal. And so these are just images, or the images where you see Trump running from arresting officers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh, I remember those. I remember seeing those. Yeah, yeah. </p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Which is weird because you would imagine with the video capabilities of deepfakes and whatnot, and especially with voice generation, you can do a much better fake, but the more data points you have, humans are really good at spotting things that are not real. And so with images, they say a picture is worth 1000 words, but people are generally pretty bad at noticing what&#8217;s fake about one single image just because of the way we&#8217;re wired. Ever since we&#8217;re born, we open our eyes, we start collecting data about what&#8217;s real and what&#8217;s not, about what does a human face look like, what proportions, what are the microexpressions, so on and so forth. But you can&#8217;t capture any of that from a single image.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, you know, what you mentioned there is sort of an interesting corollary to what I tell people all the time about design. I often have encountered people over the years that are like, &#8220;oh, I&#8217;m not creative, I&#8217;m not a designer,&#8221; that sort of thing. But I tell them that everything that they have used or encountered in the world is a byproduct of design. Like the clothes you wear, the chair you sit in, the car you drive. Someone had to really think about that and cater that to a human&#8217;s usage or what have you. And so we know when something has been designed poorly. We don&#8217;t have to be a designer to know that, but we have enough just sort of like tactile experience with designed objects to know when something is poorly designed. So it&#8217;s kind of a corollary to what you&#8217;re saying with we see and know enough as humans to know when something is just not like maybe it&#8217;s in that uncanny valley, but something is just not quite right about the image that we&#8217;re seeing. Like the Pope in a white puffer jacket or something like that. Is that real, you know? That kind of thing.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Exactly. I was reading a book about that, about design. I believe the author called it the Norman Door. Have you ever gone up to a door and you didn&#8217;t read the push or pull sign? But it had a handle, and handles generally mean grab and pull.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>But you grab the handle and then you push in where you&#8217;re supposed to push. And so you feel kind of stupid. You grab the handle and you pull toward you and it goes and then you see the word, it says push. Well, that&#8217;s not your fault, right? That&#8217;s bad design. Yeah, flat surfaces are for pushing and pulling gives you a handle and there&#8217;s no two ways about but, you know, depending on where you stand.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Like I like that analogy. That makes sense. One thing that I love what you&#8217;re doing with Myster Giraffe, and you talked about this earlier, is kind of&#8230;you&#8217;re using synthetic media to kind of amplify otherwise, I think, marginalized voices and faces. Honestly, looking ahead, what developments or advances do you see in synthetic media, and how do you plan to kind of contribute to that through Myster Giraffe?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>So what I would like to see, for one, is I&#8217;d love to see the world&#8217;s first synthetic host for an awards show. I think you can really get away with that for an awards show because the stakes are low.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Or like a Dancing With The Stars or something where it&#8217;s purely entertainment. There&#8217;s no real weight on it. And then what I&#8217;d also like to see is&#8230;I&#8217;d like to see someone take the reins, if they haven&#8217;t already yet, and design a show specifically to allow you the choice of who you want to be the main character. So let&#8217;s say you have three identical body types. You have 5&#8217;10&#8221;, brown skin, clean shaven. There are several actors that can fit in that category. And so if you take three of those actors and you have one sort of dummy body, if you will, run through the scenes, run the acting, and still tell a good story. Right. And then let&#8217;s say, much like Bandersnatch on Netflix, you could choose your own adventure. I would love to be able to sit down and choose who I want to see in that role for that film and then watch it three different times to see how I feel about it. Because a lot of the times how we feel about actors changes how we feel about the film. And so if Jim Carrey was Vin Diesel in Fast and The Furious, the whole movie would feel different.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Even if he wasn&#8217;t being funny in the moment, he would feel funnier because of who we know Jim Carrey to be. And so sort of experimenting and playing with that juxtaposition I think will be cool to see. I think also allowing us to&#8230;there&#8217;s no reason why when shopping online, we shouldn&#8217;t be able to see ourselves in the clothes that we want to wear. Why do we have to buy the clothes and send them back? We should be able to see how we look in them before we waste the fuel and polluting the environment, not knowing how it&#8217;s going to look on us. So we should be able to deepfake ourselves pretty much wherever we want to, whether that&#8217;s in a&#8230;I&#8217;ll give an example. Let&#8217;s say Cardi B comes out with a new music video, but she comes out with a version where you can put yourself in it and then everyone can put themselves in it as a means of creating another viral sensation. I mean, there&#8217;s so many different flavors of ethical ways to engage with people, allowing them to have fun with it instead of it being all sort of doom and gloom and, &#8220;oh, no, they&#8217;re gonna come get you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. You mentioned that about the shopping, and that immediately made me think about what Snap is doing with augmented reality. Like, I think it&#8217;s like a Snap&#8230;I think it&#8217;s called like Shop Suite or Shopping Suite or something like that, where you can do just that. You can sort of use augmented reality to see how clothes will look on you before you buy them. So you can get a sense of like, &#8220;oh, this might work for me.&#8221; I think Target does this, Amazon does this, for some products where you can use AR to see how like a piece of furniture or a plant or something might fit in your space before you actually buy it. Because you know, if you go to the store, you got to measure, then you got to go to your spot and measure and make sure that it fits and all that kind of stuff. Whereas now you can just use AR to kind of approximate for the most part how something will look on you or in your space. So I could see that being fleshed out more certainly as technology kind of gets better.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. I&#8217;ve seen them for shoes. I&#8217;ve seen people&#8230;I just saw someone was just acquired or started working with Amazon for putting, trying shoes on, which is great because the hardest part about trying on shoes is that you have to go there and they don&#8217;t have your size, so on and so forth. But being able to see that the shoes are on your feet now, you still can&#8217;t feel them, which is the other half of that, but at least you&#8217;re halfway there. But I think there&#8217;s a lot of ways to use the technology and use your own face. Or my favorite one, or actually two of my favorite ones &#8212; one of them is&#8230;there&#8217;s a quote that says, &#8220;today is the youngest you&#8217;ll ever be ever again and tomorrow you&#8217;ll be older and older and older. So for online creators whose faces are their money or their investments, they spend a lot of time on skincare and wellness products and Athletic Greens to make sure their skin is glowing and they never bank the data. They never bank the data. And so right now you could take 30 minutes out of your day or every year 30 minutes and bank your data and keep&#8230;and sort of put this version of you in carbonite. So in five years from now, gravity, sun, wind takes us all down eventually. Why not be able to call on that older version of you to essentially freeze a digital version of you in time and have that be your Internet facing version forever?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>That cuts down on having to get plastic surgery if you don&#8217;t want it, having to get Botox if you don&#8217;t want it. Just having an independent version of you that only lives online. Sort of like a Max Headroom that never changes. And I believe that&#8217;s going to be a way we&#8217;re going to interact with the Internet sort of in the near future. Sort of like a Ready Player One way where you just have your avatar and you can choose to show up how you want to show up because you should have freedom and individuality on the Internet. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Right. </p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>And the second one is &#8212; and I&#8217;m really passionate about this and I haven&#8217;t found the right candidate yet because I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m approaching it correctly &#8212; is that I would like to offer a burn victim the chance to restore their face digitally for use on the Internet, depending on how severely they were burned and so on and so forth. But if they have enough data of their face before the accident, you can restore their faces if they so choose.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>If they choose, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>There&#8217;s so many different use cases that have yet to be seen that I&#8217;m really excited about either Myster Giraffe creating them or other people creating them.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>You know, you mentioned the thing about the digital host, and immediately I was like, if there&#8217;s any media entity that I think that could probably pull that off and it would work, it&#8217;s probably BET. Like, BET had &#8220;Cita&#8217;s World&#8221; back in I was hoping you would like early 2001, but not only that, they brought Cita back. I think it was in 2021. BET had a reality show called &#8220;The Encore&#8221; that had these like it had like, Black girl groups from the it had like 702 and Total and I think Kiely Williams and some other folks and they were like all in a house, like, trying to make a hit or something like that. And Cita was the host. I mean, granted, it was only like, on a television, but it was like a more updated version of Cita that would be the so, like, if anybody, I think, could pull it off and at least has a precedent for it, BET, I&#8217;m putting that out there.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>You know, I&#8217;ve used that example and depending on the room you&#8217;re in, they won&#8217;t know it. They don&#8217;t know who Cita is. They&#8217;ve never heard of Cita.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Right!</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Cita who? Cita who? But that was ground&#8211; And this was 20 years ago. Yeah, actually, I was reading the story behind that and it was a couple of brothers out of Atlanta, I believe, that came up with the idea. And it was very popular and it fell out for whatever reasons. But I think you&#8217;re right about that. I think they definitely have the prestige in order to bring that back or to be the first. Let&#8217;s just say&#8230;let&#8217;s hope Tyler Perry gets to buy BET and puts it up.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, speaking of Atlanta, I want to kind of shift the conversation because we spent a lot of time, you know, just kind of talking shop, But learning some more about you as I was kind of doing research for this interview&#8230;you&#8217;re from Atlanta originally?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>I am from Atlanta.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Tell me what your time was like here.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>So I&#8217;m from Atlanta and I went to elementary school through high school and college. I started out going to&#8230;I got a band scholarship to go to Clark-Atlanta University. I was in the drumline, like most of the people in 2001 who played an instrument at the time. Only stayed there for a year, went to Georgia State for a couple of years for a graphic design foundation. Wasn&#8217;t really thrilled with the program, wasn&#8217;t really into graphic design as much as I thought it was. I was more into the motion. And so I left Georgia State after two years and went to AIU for the last year and a half to focus on visual communication, where I really dug into 3D, specifically Maya and After Effects and whatnot. Graduated, did an internship at Riot Atlanta, which I believe was absorbed by Company 3, and got my start. Left there three months later, worked in graphic design and motion graphics for the next six months, then I said, &#8220;you know what, I&#8217;m just going to go for it.&#8221; So I left to go to Los Angeles.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And so for your time here in ATL at Georgia State and then at AIU &#8212; I&#8217;m kind of trying to place this in terms of the time frame. I&#8217;m guessing this is like right around late 90s, early 2000s kinda?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>I graduated college in 2005.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay. So a little bit later. Okay. But I was trying to think of what the curriculum might have been, because what it sounds like is what you wanted to learn, there might have just been maybe just a limit in terms of how much the school could teach you.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. Everything was still books. YouTube didn&#8217;t really exist in the way that it did now. I believe They just got started and everything was 240p. And so if you wanted to learn it, you get a book and you get a DVD and good luck. So that&#8217;s not my preferred way of learning. Neither is most people&#8217;s based on the success of online courses. But I would say I didn&#8217;t really learn what I needed to to be competitive until I left Atlanta. Unfortunately, I had to come to Los Angeles, which at the time, and I think before the pandemic, they were still the number one market for motion graphics and visual effects. Now it&#8217;s much more global, so I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re still number one, but I do know that a lot of filming still happens in Atlanta, but rarely, if ever is there any post-production done in Atlanta. It still comes back to Los Angeles.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, you know, we talked about this a bit before recording. You were like back then, the only places you really could have gotten a job was, like you said, TBS. What was the other place you mentioned? I forgot already. </p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>TBS, The Weather Channel&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>The Weather Channel! That&#8217;s right. The Weather Channel. Or if you&#8217;re lucky, Cartoon Network.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Correct. That was sort of it. It was sort of a one horse town in terms of post-production. Now it&#8217;s maybe a three horse town, which is great. I&#8217;m happy to see them growing, but there&#8217;s still not a lot of shops and certainly not &#8212; I know Method Studios opened up an office there, maybe a couple of others, but it&#8217;s definitely not a booming industry there yet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Atlanta, I feel like, has always been&#8230;and God bless them. I was working in the tourism industry like in 2005 and 2006. And I got to tell you, Atlanta was kind of as a city, and I say this only from, like, a tourism perspective, not from a cultural perspective, but from a tourism perspective&#8230;Atlanta was kind of failing because we had lost as a city&#8230;we had lost this really big convention. I think it was the Home Builders show. And that was like something that brought in like a billion dollars worth of revenue into the city every year, and then they just chose another city. Hurricane Katrina happened in&#8230;I think it was 2005. I think Katrina happened, and Atlanta picked up a lot of their convention business, and that really kind of turned things around, I think, for the state to the point where they were able to lobby to state government. And then state government started putting in these tax credits for entertainment. And then that&#8217;s how these production studios started coming here and filming. I&#8217;m curious as to what Atlanta would have looked like if we hadn&#8217;t&#8230;I mean, benefited is probably the wrong word, but if we hadn&#8217;t benefited from being able to pick up that business from New Orleans, because a lot of people, at least back then, really didn&#8217;t want to come to Atlanta. They had a really negative perception of Atlanta, partially from Freaknik, that just carried over into the next decade, but then also know people would come downtown and there was nothing to do. Like, they come downtown, and after five o&#8217;clock, everything is dead. And conventioneers would often be angry about thee fact that they can&#8217;t walk from their hotel to the restaurant without getting accosted by homeless people. And I don&#8217;t want to bring my family here, and there&#8217;s a whole bunch of strip clubs, there&#8217;s a lot of Black people. I just don&#8217;t know what to know to do&#8230;that whole thing. And the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau was really trying hard to, like, we need to find a way to brand the city. Like, we need something like Milton Glazer&#8217;s &#8220;I Love New York&#8221; or something like that. And they paid this agency like $8 million to put together this Brand Atlanta campaign. Were you here when Brand Stlanta happened? I think you might have been maybe on the way to L.A.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Might have just left. I left in 2007.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, they did this whole Brand Atlanta campaign, and they paid for this really bad logo that was like a combination&#8230;like, if you took the Target logo and the Ubisoft logo and put it in a blender, it basically just looked like a bullet hole, which probably was not a great visual for the city. It&#8217;s like ATL in this red bullet hole. And they had produced a song called &#8220;The ATL&#8221; with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Ludacris, because I remember being in the [Georgia] Dome when that happened, when they premiered it, I was like, &#8220;this is really bad.&#8221; And granted, people still come to Atlanta for the music, and the entertainment and stuff, but they wasted so much money on that branding campaign, it was ridiculous. I say all of that to say that Atlanta really sort of benefited from that in some ways in the creative industry. But like, I think in other ways, you know, it took a while for the schools to catch up because Atlanta is pretty unique in that we have so many HBCUs, but then we also have kind of some top tier schools like Georgia Tech or Emory or something. And there&#8217;s also like art schools here. There&#8217;s [The] Art Institute [of Atlanta]. Well, Atlanta College of Art got absorbed into [The] Art Institute [of Atlanta], but the Portfolio Center, SCAD now has a campus here, but they didn&#8217;t back then. And now the city, I think, is known for its creative output. But for creatives that are here, and I can tell you this from trying to do the show, it&#8217;s been so hard to try to get Atlanta people on this show. They don&#8217;t want to do it. Or there&#8217;s always some excuse, or&#8230;and I mean that this is probably neither here nor there. But I say that to say I think Atlanta outputs a lot of creative work. I think it&#8217;s tough to be a creative and stay here because the infrastructure is just not supported from the business end. It may be from the community end, but not from the business end. There&#8217;s a lot of folks, a lot of really talented folks I know that have had to pick up and leave because the opportunities aren&#8217;t here.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>The opportunities aren&#8217;t there. I would agree with you. I just shot a music video in Atlanta maybe five weeks ago. Hopefully it&#8217;s going to release soon. And shooting the music video there with a small budget and three days of prep would have been impossible in Los Angeles, be completely impossible. I was able to show up on a Friday afternoon with nothing, no talent. Well, I had the main talent, but no supporting roles. It was a two day shoot, had zero locations, and in a day and a half I had everything. So I had the warehouse location that had proper lighting and had the white psyche and they had the robotic arm. I had the people who knew other people. I mean, it&#8217;s a very small community. The people working in post-production or production in Atlanta is a very small, insulated community. But I was able to find one person who let me into that community enough for me to get the resources that I needed. And so as much as I say Atlanta is not ready, it is ready if you have that one person. But if you show up to Atlanta and you know no one, you&#8217;re going to have a really hard time with trying to make it happen. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>So, you know&#8230;it can be tricky, but they kind of saved my bacon. So I do want to say that. Now, that being said, all the post-production went back to Los Angeles, but in terms of getting stuff shot, finding makeup artists who actually know what they&#8217;re doing, B-camera operators, producers. Those people do exist in small amounts. There&#8217;s no strike going on there right now, so I think they&#8217;re okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m pretty sure there might be some strikes here. I haven&#8217;t heard of anything but then I also haven&#8217;t really been looking, so I&#8217;m not sure. Now, right before you started, Myster Giraffe, you joined Aliza Technologies as their chief technology officer. This was in 2019. Tell me about that experience. How was that?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>So I had been freelancing for about a decade at that point, and I was looking for a new opportunity, and I really wanted to build something instead of just being the hired mercenary to solve this problem, which I really like doing, and I&#8217;m talented at it, but I just wanted to sink my teeth into something. So I reached out to a buddy of mine who has a company &#8212; shout out to Zerply &#8212; who does a lot of hiring for the VFX industry, and he connected me with someone who was looking for someone to build a team to create digital avatars. And at the time Lil Miquela was coming out, she was making a lot of noise being the first big one, the first American influencer to be an AI robot, and people didn&#8217;t really know what that meant, instead of just I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s sort of like a weird time. Anyway, Brian Lee of the League of Zoom Company, the Honest Company, and ShoeDazzle, had this big idea to have a universe of influencers, and he needed someone to help build the team and get the influencers created digitally. So I was hired in 2018 to facilitate that as a consultant. So I hired people from around the world working from home and getting those sort of&#8230;this quarterbacking that process, getting the designs from the concept artist to the sculptor to the renderer to the look of that person. When everyone was created, he said, &#8220;all right, we want you to come in here and lead the team and get everything going in person.&#8221; So April 1, 2019, got in the office, and besides building computers and setting up networks, asked, &#8220;where can I provide the most value?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I want you to figure out how to animate these characters.&#8221; Prior to that, two months prior to me starting, I talked about deepfake, and they didn&#8217;t know what it was, so I told them about what it was and how maybe we can use it to animate the characters, because initially I gave them a budget, a VFX budget, and it was very expensive. And I said, welcome to VFX. And they said, can you make it cheaper? I said probably. So I told them about deepfakes. It was open source code out of the Eastern bloc, so from day one, I start specing out a machine to start learning on, and I don&#8217;t have a machine learning background. But what I do have is a method of solving problems from working in VFX, so I didn&#8217;t have to have a machine learning background or to solve a problem, so long as I would approach the problem methodically and chart my progress, so on and so forth. So three months from April 1, we were seeing really good signs of progress, and the task was to turn 3D data into a data set that could be used for machine learning to make animation 80 times faster and cheaper. And so three months later, we&#8217;re seeing some progress. Six months later we started filing patents. We got granted five patents, and those patents still hold. And that was sort of my role at Aliza was many things, but mainly focusing on the animation of these characters and how to get them, how to use a real human to drive the character, replace their head with a CG character in order to save time and money.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious if that work kind of helped feed into what you were sort of doing with Myster Giraffe. Not to say it&#8217;s like on-the-job training, but I&#8217;m curious if that kind of helped you out in that aspect.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>It was absolutely off-the-job training because I would do it on the weekends or in the evenings, because I was trying to, as a person who was not a deepfake artist at the time, I was just practicing. And so what Myster Giraffe started was it was really just scratch paper. I have this idea, I want to know what happens if I use less data for this, or I want to know what happens if I use three different types of data here. And so each of the first, I would say ten or twelve videos was just me trying different things. And then it became, well, I wonder how people are going to respond to this sort of thing. And it just became this sort of social experiment of how are people going to respond to this? Whereas it started as, I wonder how this is going to look if I do this XYZ, how much data do I have? What kind of data do I need? How big does video have to be? So on and so forth.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>So it sounds like that was just a really good, I think, like you said, you had to have something where you could focus on building one thing as opposed to kind of doing these off, I guess, freelance type work, like working, doing one thing here, doing one thing there. You kind of had some stability, it sounds like.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I had some stability. I had now had a full time job for the first time in a decade, which was odd because I had not been in that role, but at the same time, I wanted that role so I could sink my teeth in. And so when everyone was settled and in the bed on a Saturday night, I&#8217;d show up to work at 8:00 p.m. and stay &#8217;til 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. Wow. And just experiment, experiment, experiment. So there&#8217;s a lot of bloods and tears on intimate draft. I would say out of everything I&#8217;ve posted, that&#8217;s only about 10% of the work I certainly that&#8217;s only about 10% of the work I show. The other 90% is in a graveyard of stuff that is either too inappropriate to show because of it&#8217;s funny when you try to tell a story sometimes and you&#8217;re also trying to use comedy. Sometimes you try to toe the line, but you accidentally fall over to one side or thee other, and if you get lucky, you&#8217;ll stay on the good side. But sometimes thee experiments end up on the not so funny side and then you have to bury them or the data doesn&#8217;t work out. Like, I&#8217;ll give you an example. Some of those videos I&#8217;ll sit on for two or three years, and I&#8217;ll know I want to use them, but because I don&#8217;t have the right data, it doesn&#8217;t work out. So Michael B. Jordan, I&#8217;ve been trying to get the data of him for two years, and when he was with Lori Harvey and when he was doing different press campaigns and so on and so forth, I couldn&#8217;t get the right data. But because of this newest run for Creed III, I was able to get the right data, which made that video happen. So it wasn&#8217;t really up to me when I got the data. It just had to sort of arrive and now I could move forward with it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, interesting, because yeah, like you said earlier about consent, you couldn&#8217;t just put this together if the footage didn&#8217;t really exist or you didn&#8217;t get that permission from them. But now that he&#8217;s doing this press work, he&#8217;s out there. You&#8217;re now able to sort of gather these sources and then use that to put together a clip like that.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s correct, yeah. There&#8217;s tons of people I would love to do, but I just can&#8217;t get the right data for them. Like Prince. He&#8217;s gone now, unfortunately, and he looks so different every time you would see him. But it&#8217;s hard to really nail down a good data set of him. So it just may never happen. But that&#8217;s okay because that&#8217;s how it should be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Personally, over the years, how would you say you&#8217;ve evolved as a creative?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>I would say I&#8217;ve become more thoughtful in what I create. I also spend less time creating and more time thinking. I used to create for the sake of creating, which scratched a different itch. But I think as I&#8217;ve gotten older, I want my creations to have a bigger impact with less effort. Because I believe that&#8217;s&#8230;when you&#8217;re creating a painting of a Campbell Soup can, you know, it seems like student work, but yet that&#8217;s one of the biggest American pieces. And so I think the more and more I do Myster Giraffe or anything for that matter. I try to spend more time thinking than time doing. That way I can do it correctly the first time without having to make a lot of changes to end up at the same place.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, this work with synthetic media, I think is only going to improve as technology improves. What kind of keeps you motivated to continue with this?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>I would say the storytelling aspect of it all. There are so many stories that need to be told. Whether they&#8217;re in still format or whether they&#8217;re a full video, whether it&#8217;s found footage, whether you have to go on set and shoot something. There are so many stories to be told. And I think that to be Black in this country is to have your culture cherry-picked for what it&#8217;s worth. But rarely do we get a chance to be at the forefront of technology and to tell the stories that we like to tell. Which is why there are so many slave biopics we don&#8217;t need anymore. Yeah, we want afrofuturism and afropunk to see the newest Spider-Man and to see the character that was the British punk character, but he was Black, was mind blowing for a lot of people because most people have never seen a Black British punk character in their lives. And while that was an entire movement, maybe the 70s, 80s, and 90s and in Europe, we never saw it in the U.S. And so I think just being able to see something and tell a story around it just because we want to, I think that is important and powerful because we&#8217;ve never been able to do that before. So now that the technology is being more democratized, I think is the best time to do it now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>To that point, I&#8217;m pretty sure that there are listeners that are hearing what you&#8217;re doing and they might be interested in wanting to try to get involved in synthetic media creating it or something in some way. What advice would you give them if they want to try to delve into this deeper?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>I would say to start just by absorbing as much knowledge as you can. Everything you ever wanted to learn is now on the Internet. Everything, every single thing. And if you don&#8217;t want to learn it, you don&#8217;t have to. But if you want to, just go read, go watch a TikTok video, watch a YouTube video, read a Reddit entry, go on a forum, ask someone. But there&#8217;s no more excuses for not doing. Everything is available right now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Where do you see yourself in the next five years? Maybe this is a little hard to kind of see because of how the technology is changing so rapidly, but what kind of work do you want to be doing in the future?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>My immediate goal is to produce the very first deepfake leaning entertainment show. That&#8217;s my first goal. There&#8217;s a deepfake show that has not been created in the U.S. Yet. There&#8217;s one in the U.K. that didn&#8217;t do so well. But I would like to create the first deepfake entertainment show in the US. And then from there have a slew of game shows, talk shows, so on and so forth, proving that you can use the technology in an ethical way and have sign off on everyone who watches it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I love that. I think you can make it happen too. I really mean it. You&#8217;re in L.A. You&#8217;ve got skin in the game clearly for doing this. I mean, you&#8217;re a pioneer as far as I&#8217;m concerned when it comes to this. So I feel like that&#8217;s definitely going to happen for you.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Well, I appreciate that. From your mouth to God&#8217;s ears.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Well, just to wrap this up, where can our audience find out more information about you? Where can they see the clips, the studio? Where can they find that information online?</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Sure. So you can find me online on Instagram at @mystergiraffe, which is M-Y-S-T-E-R. Giraffe. G-I-R-A-F-F-E. Or you can just send me an email at carl@mystergiraffe.com.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, sounds good. Carl Bogan, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. Like I mentioned before we started recording, I was super excited to talk to you and this conversation did not disappoint at all. I mean, like I just said earlier, you&#8217;re a pioneer when it comes to this. You&#8217;ve had skin in the game for years. You&#8217;re making work that is one I think showcasing and celebrating Black culture. But you&#8217;re doing it in a way that is fun, it&#8217;s informative. It&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re not trying to incite anarchy or anything like that. I mean, really, you&#8217;re at the forefront of this as far as I&#8217;m concerned. So I really am interested to see how far you can take synthetic media in the future and I really do see that show for you in the future. So thank you so much for coming on the show, for sharing your story and everything. I really appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Carl Bogan:</b></p>
<p>Of course, thank you for having me. I really enjoyed the time together.</p>

<p>Kristina Turner is really putting Montgomery on the map when it comes to design and creativity! With over a decade of experience working for in-house agencies around Alabama, her focus on rethinking legacy brands, overseeing digital experiences, and delivering award-winning visual storytelling means she&#8217;s definitely someone we need to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>We talked a lot about her work as senior director of marketing and storytelling at Jeremiah Program, as well as her involvement as regional director for district seven of the American Advertising Federation. Of course, we both had to share our experiences about growing up between Selma and Montgomery, volunteering for national professional organizations, and she spoke about what keeps her in Montgomery and what that affords her as a creative. Kristina is really representing for the South, and I&#8217;m excited to see what else she&#8217;ll do in the future!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>I am Kristina Turner. I like to say I&#8217;m a creative, but at the heart, at the root of it, I really am a graphic designer. That&#8217;s where I started. But I&#8217;ve kind of found my way into more than just graphic design. So I&#8217;ve been dabbling in marketing, event planning, all of the above. So yeah, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing. That&#8217;s me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Any plans for the summer? Like, how&#8217;s this year been kind of treating you so far?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>This year has been good. I&#8217;m already ready for a break. It&#8217;s been six months now. I&#8217;m like, is it break time? It&#8217;s coming. I&#8217;m actually going to San Diego Comic Con next month. So I need to square away all of my plans for that. Actually, on the spur of the moment, yesterday or Sunday, I was like, should I do it? I was like, I bought New York Comic Con tickets, so we&#8217;ll see if I actually go. And that&#8217;s in October.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>OK, you should do it. I&#8217;ve not been to one of those big cons like that like New York or San Francisco. But comic conventions in general are just a lot of fun.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>It is. And once you started going to just small ones, like locally, and I was like, oh, that&#8217;s fun. And then I was like, venturing out. And I think New York was my first big one. And I was like, oh my. Like, this is a real like, see the celebrities. You sit on the panels. You get to watch sometimes episodes of a TV show before it. Yeah, it&#8217;s everything that I could ever want.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Is there anything in particular that you want to try to accomplish by the end of the year?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>I have a blog and I&#8217;ve kind of let it lay dormant for a while. But I want to pick it back up and kind of get it more into my regular routine and updating and writing more because I do enjoy the writing. And I&#8217;ve also been dabbling around going, should I start a YouTube channel? Because I feel like that&#8217;s what everyone says these days. And I was like, maybe I should start a YouTube channel. So one of these things, if I don&#8217;t get to the YouTube, I definitely want to just be consistent with my blog.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot about sort of branching out and doing some kind of video content. Whether it&#8217;s YouTube or TikTok, I don&#8217;t know. As an old head, I&#8217;m not quite there yet. I realize the utility of it. Like people are just watching more stuff. They&#8217;re consuming more video, long or short form. But I&#8217;m not there yet. I&#8217;m almost there, but I&#8217;m not there yet.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t blame you. I don&#8217;t TikTok. Like, I have a TikTok and I&#8217;ve posted a few because at one point I was like, well, I&#8217;m going to make a reel or two and then just repost it on TikTok. It&#8217;s too much effort.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s a lot one thing to kind of learn the tool itself because everything is right there in the app. But then also you&#8217;re subject to the whims of the algorithm. And I think it&#8217;s that way with all of social media, but particularly for video stuff, you&#8217;re really subject to algorithms on whether or not anybody even sees it.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Exactly. I think the thing is, it starts out as really fun. Like, you do it, and then, like you said, you start thinking about the algorithm, like, who&#8217;s seeing it, you get addicted to those likes, and then it becomes not fun anymore because you&#8217;re like, who am I making this for anymore?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Right. I have friends of mine that are creators, and they definitely will. They&#8217;ll create something, they&#8217;ll put it out there, but then they&#8217;ll follow it up with saying, like, &#8220;please go and like it so the algorithm can blah, blah, blah.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, are you doing it for your followers, or are you doing it for this algorithm, this faceless program that may or may not push your stuff out to a bigger audience?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, honestly, on one of my Instagrams for my blog, I haven&#8217;t posted on the grid since December because I just literally got I was over it. I was like, Why am I posting this? I&#8217;m just now starting to get back to a point where it&#8217;s like, you know what? I need to just start posting for myself, not for other people. If other people like it, that&#8217;s cool, but I just need to start posting for myself. So that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m getting back there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I hear you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about your work. You are the Senior Director of Marketing and Storytelling at Jeremiah Program. Tell me about the organization and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, so Jeremiah Program, we&#8217;re actually in our 25th year this year. What they do is it started in Minneapolis, Minnesota. And what they did was they recognized a need for single mothers who need some help, who want to finish their college degree. And so what the program does is provides a personalized coach to you to help you coach your way through college to help you finish that degree. If you have a child, we have pre K programs that they can go into as well. So it&#8217;s a two generational model. Like, we want to be helping mom and child at the same time because there&#8217;s just this cycle of poverty that we&#8217;re trying to disrupt, basically. Right. And so I know a lot of people go like, oh, you don&#8217;t need college degrees anymore, which in some cases, it actually is very true. But what we found is that all the research done, college degree is still the lever that needs to be pulled to get up in the ranks to start making more money. It hasn&#8217;t been disproved as the way yet. Some people get lucky and there&#8217;s influencers and all that stuff, but it&#8217;s still the thing that is consistently, it still works. </p>
<p>And so we encourage people who want to finish that degree. If you just need that help to just finish that degree, if you just need some of the campuses. We have non campuses across the country and so some campuses have child development centers, so that&#8217;s pre K programs that they go to. Some of them even provide housing. If housing is like a barrier, like, I can&#8217;t get my housing and my childcare together, then like, cool, we got you. And so you focus on getting this because we don&#8217;t want you to trade your dreams for something else, right? So, yeah, that&#8217;s what JP does. </p>
<p>And so in my role, I started working there a little over a year. It&#8217;s been a year and a couple of months. I actually started by working through a friend who was contract with them, doing some design work, and he was like, I could use some help. And I was like, sure, I can do some extra freelance work. And so I started doing freelance work for about six months and then I found out at the end of the year that they were looking to build their own in house team and I was like, oh, good, cool. That sounds like a cool opportunity. I like the mission. And so I didn&#8217;t know that it was you build the team and do the work. And I was like, oh, okay, and literally like, kind of building from scratch. So me and another person, we started she&#8217;s more of a content writer editor. So we started together and we&#8217;ve built this team now to five people. And so we basically handle all the marketing, like social channels and website and that kind of stuff, like the main national stuff. We handle that and then we also assist campuses in anything that they need. And so we&#8217;re also like our main charge at this point is getting people brand aligned because the brand has kind of been all over the place for many years and so now it&#8217;s like, we need people to understand that JP is one organization, no matter where they are.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m looking at the website now. First of all, the website looks great. I mean, I don&#8217;t know how much of that you might have had a hand in or not, but it really looks good. And I love that it&#8217;s an organization that&#8217;s really about helping people. It&#8217;s about helping families, helping mothers, helping single mothers. I&#8217;m reading through The Commitment to Social Justice where it says &#8220;JP supports 100% women, 100% single moms experiencing poverty, and 100% parents in pursuit of a college degree with 80% of those parents identifying as black, Latinx and indigenous.&#8221; Oh, I love that. That is so super important.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, because I think a lot of people try to social justice is such like a word that people just either love it or they&#8217;re, oh, social justice, I don&#8217;t want anything. But I think the thing is what JP does is that they basically explain, like, you can&#8217;t divorce one from the like, it is directly like this poverty issue is directly related to all these social justice issues. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re in this situation, and so we don&#8217;t run away from it, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious. You say you&#8217;re having to sort of build the team and everything like that. Has that been sort of the hardest part about what you do is making sure that you&#8217;ve got this kind of unified team under one brand?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>My team right now is killer. I love my team. Yeah. We have five people, including me. So I have a designer on staff. I have a digital marketing person, digital strategist, someone who does like writing. And then our coordinator kind of keeps us all together. And so our hopes in the next year or two is grow a little bit bigger because we started easing our way into it, but now we&#8217;re taking on more and more work. And so I&#8217;ve been lucky to come to a place that not everybody understands, like branding and marketing design. And I&#8217;m lucky that I have a CEO who cares about that and has invested the resources into getting it done. And so I&#8217;m so glad. That&#8217;s one of the things I never had to explain, like, why is this important to my boss? Because she gets it. And so, yeah, right now, everything is good for us.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, is it a remote team or is there an office that you&#8217;re reporting into?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>My team is fully remote, which is so strange to me. I&#8217;ve never been a fully remote person until last year, I think 2020. A lot of people went remote and then they went remote part time. But yeah, this is my first time being fully remote, and my team is fully remote. So we&#8217;re all on the national team, and so we all are remote. If you live near a campus, then that could be your home base. But yeah, none of my team are by campus, so they&#8217;re all remote.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>How&#8217;s that been? Sort of building and managing that.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>I was a little worried about being remote because I have been an in person person for so long. But honestly, it&#8217;s been pretty good because I think the best part is I have a team that&#8217;s very committed to getting the work done and putting out good work. So that&#8217;s the first thing. Two, I used to be a person who hated daily meetings. Daily check in meetings or stand up meetings. We used to call them, and I started doing those. We do those almost every day. And if we don&#8217;t have anything to talk about, we won&#8217;t do it. But we do those every day. It&#8217;s just like, let&#8217;s start the day with each other just to level set the day and be like, okay, what do we got? Making sure we&#8217;re on top. Is there any questions? Whatever. And it kind of helps ground us all in the day or what&#8217;s happening, and then we go about our business the rest of the day. That has been the most helpful thing, I think, in managing a remote team.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, along with your work with Jeremiah Orogram, you&#8217;re the regional director for AAF, District Seven. AAF, standing for the American Advertising Federation. How did you first get involved with them?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Oh, man, how anybody gets involved, they&#8217;re like, oh, the event planning. I want to do part. I&#8217;m still a part, but I was part of my local chapter in Montgomery. How I got involved was a coworker of mine was like, hey, they&#8217;re looking for committee members to be on the American Advertising Awards Committee. And I was like, oh, that big party they plan? I was like, oh, yeah, I want to do that. And I didn&#8217;t end up going to the meeting. And she went and she came back and she said, well, not only do they want me to join the committee, they want me to be the chair. And then I said, oh, okay, I can be on your committee. And then we let them know that I wanted to be on the committee. And then they were like, why don&#8217;t you just be co chairs? And somehow I found myself on the board. And so, yeah, we did that. </p>
<p>That first year, it was really cool. It was just interesting and seeing all the work regionally, like the stuff that people enter, having to find judges and having to play in this awards gala. I learned a lot through the club, through that, and then I think I did that for two years, and then I kind of just moved up and started doing other positions. I really loved being education chair, and that was me just, like, connecting with all the local colleges and finding out who has design and marketing programs and how do we involve students, how do we help students. And that was a really great year for that chair. And I moved up into a diversity chair at one point because I was like, no one&#8217;s doing this. There&#8217;s a diversity chair. It&#8217;s like, the chair, there one, skips it&#8217;s okay if we don&#8217;t have this one. And so that year I was like, I&#8217;ll do diversity, and I learned so much about what is AF doing on that ground. </p>
<p>And then eventually I became president, which I didn&#8217;t want, but it happened, and it was good. It was great. Honestly, I was president two years in a row. It was probably one of the best experiences I&#8217;ve ever had. I made a lot of connections locally, but know, around the south also because our District Seven means Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, part of Louisiana, Mississippi. So if you have a club and whatever, you know, all like, you have this huge network in the south. I took a year, maybe like a year, year and a half, almost two years off because I was just a little burnt out. But they asked me on the district level like, hey, would you mind wanting to join the district level. And I was like, why not? And so in my job in regional, I&#8217;m just kind of like the liaison between the district and the local level. So I get assigned like maybe four or five clubs. I check in with them, just make sure they&#8217;re okay. If they have questions that they can&#8217;t figure out, I try to help them. And it&#8217;s just kind of like a go between and help kind of guiding some clubs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it sounds like you really have taken on a lot of leadership through them. Like you said, these different chair positions. Now you&#8217;re regional director. How does AAF help you as a working creative?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>I will say that when I started AAF, I was just a designer. Like at my job, my title was just designer. And I was doing a lot of the boring stuff, which letters and that kind of stuff in mail. And so it was a good creative outlet for me of like, oh, I get to do some other stuff like event planning and creating graphics for these events and playing around on social and going, what works? What&#8217;s getting people&#8217;s attention? I want them to come RSVP for an event and even like finding speakers and booking speakers, like ooh and me paying attention to who&#8217;s out there, what names are out there, who&#8217;s giving good advice. And so I was doing all of this stuff, and at the time, my boss was really supportive of me being involved in the club. I took a lot of work time sometimes to do it in middle of the day or would take off early to go do it. And one day he came to me and he was like, I see all this stuff that you&#8217;re doing with AF and how you&#8217;ve grown the club, and it&#8217;s great. Now I&#8217;m going to give you a promotion and you&#8217;re going to do all that same stuff here. And I was so like, it&#8217;s one of those things where it&#8217;s like, okay, it did pay off for me. At the end of the day, I was learning all this leadership skills and stuff off the job and then bringing it to the job.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, I think that&#8217;s a good thing that your job recognized that you were doing this. It didn&#8217;t try to step in or penalize. If anything, they were supportive of.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Very, very supportive.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, in the last episode for folks that are listening, I was talking with Ashley Fletcher and we had a pretty rousing conversation, I think, about the role of professional design organizations and how they should kind of be more proactive on the voice of their members. We were specifically talking about AIGA, but we lumped in a couple of other orgs in there too. AAF is not a design organization. Like you said, it&#8217;s for advertising. But it sounds like there&#8217;s some overlap there with design and that you would have maybe like visual designers or art directors creative directors, stuff like that. I&#8217;m curious, is AAF like that? It sounds like it&#8217;s been a pretty instrumental force in your career as an organization. Do you feel like they&#8217;ve really spoken up on behalf of creative people, of their members?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>For sure, AAF. I would say you&#8217;re right. AAF is definitely all encompassing. Like, even though it says the word advertising, there&#8217;s many things that go into advertising, right? You got to have a designer, you got to have a copywriter. Do you have video? People like video. You got to have that. Every spectrum of being a creative is involved in this club. You don&#8217;t have to just be like the ad guy or whoever. The way it sounds like this isn&#8217;t Mad Men. And so it covers the gamut. And so I would say AF. They definitely do speak up for the industry. They have a whole arm, like their whole thing. They do a lot of things, but their main mission always is like the government relations part of it. Every two years, they do a Day on the Hill. They get you to go speak to your representatives and talk about how if you start everyone&#8217;s looking for money and if you start tax and advertising, this is what&#8217;s going to happen. Or they&#8217;re constantly reminding people, these are the things that we&#8217;re pushing for right now. I just went to the national conference a couple of weeks ago, and one of the big things they were talking about was the data privacy issue, right. And how some states are even talking about creating their own laws. But what does it look like on a national level? They really get involved and really go to literally go to Congress and go, please look out for like, that is their main part of what AAF does, is, like, the lobbying and what&#8217;s best for the industry, because you don&#8217;t want to kill the industry because it just employs so many different types of people. And so the minute you start taxing it, that&#8217;s when things start going downhill.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>They go to Congress?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Yes, I did Day on the Hill. It was probably about four years ago, and every year we sent someone else this past spring. But yeah, we go up there. They have a lawyers group who does the research and stuff. They fully prep you before going to talk to your representative. And if you don&#8217;t actually if you&#8217;re lucky, you get to actually talk to your representative. Most times it&#8217;s like their staff or person, but either way, you&#8217;re fully prepped. You go in, like, I get to talk about, here&#8217;s how much revenue advertising brings into the state of Alabama. This is what happens if you tax it. This is how many people employs, this is how much all the good it does. And so, yeah, we literally go into that, go to DC, into their office and talk about this.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I am flabbergasted to hear&#8230;I mean, in the best way.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And I mean, I&#8217;m saying I wish I&#8217;m not a member of AIGA. AIGA, I feel like, has kind of has been like a whipping post throughout this entire podcast that&#8217;s </p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>You&#8217;re on the board, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh nooooooo. No, no, no.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Oh, I thought you were on the national board for some reason.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Oh no. So my involvement with AIGA&#8230;first of all, I was very skeptical about joining AIGA because &#8212; and this is prior to me doing the podcast, so we have to go back to 2013. And before, I had wanted to join, but had been told explicitly by [AIGA Atlanta] chapter members, chapter leadership, like, &#8220;oh, well, you didn&#8217;t go to design school, and you have to have a design degree to be a part of AIGA.&#8221; And so I didn&#8217;t go to any events or anything like that. I was just like, whatever, for real. Again, this was ten plus years ago. So the thing that changed my mind about joining AIGA was I had Antoinette Carroll on the show. She&#8217;s the founder of Creative Reaction Lab. And actually, when I talked with her, this was prior to her starting Creative Reaction Lab. She was a co-chair of AIGA&#8217;s Diversity and Inclusion Task Force. And, like, she was talking me into joining. Like, you know, if you have these thoughts about the industry, you should join, try to be part of the solution. And I was like, &#8220;you know what? You&#8217;ve convinced me. I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221; And so I was on the Diversity and Inclusion Task Force for four years. I think three or four years. I think it was like, from 2014&#8230;it was three years, 2014 to 2017, roughly about three to four years. I was on that whole time. And what I discovered was that &#8212; and I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s this way with AAF &#8212; but what I discovered was that the organization only takes diversity seriously if the person at the top, the executive director, if they take it seriously.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And so when I joined, Rick Gref√© was the, I think, longtime executive director. He was on his way out. And Julie Anixter was coming in as an executive director, and she was all about diversity and inclusion. She would come down here to Atlanta. We would have dinner. She would be really passionate about making sure that people of color, particularly Black designers in the organization, were getting recognized and being put in positions where they could make a difference. </p>
<p>The problem came when&#8230; how can I put this? I think Julie had great intentions. I love Julie, still talk to Julie to this day. But I think other people in the organization were very much anti diversity, but yet they were in positions influencing diversity. So, like, we had this person, she wasn&#8217;t the co chair. She was, like, the liaison between headquarters and the [Diversity and Inclusion] Task Force, this woman, and she was very racist. And it&#8217;s sort of like, why would you be racist and you&#8217;re over a diversity organization? I don&#8217;t know. </p>
<p>But what I also discovered is that each chapter kind of functions independently in terms of what headquarters does or what national does. So while National may be all about diversity and inclusion, the Atlanta chapter still won&#8217;t talk to me. Or like, the DC chapter is really cool, but then if I talk to a chapter in, I&#8217;m just throwing one out there, not saying I&#8217;ve talked to this chapter, but I talked to a chapter in, say, Minneapolis or something, and then they&#8217;re not cool. And so it&#8217;s like, you would think that stuff that happens at National would trickle down through the chapters, and that&#8217;s so not the case. </p>
<p>And what I would tell people, I have folks on the show and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, should I join AIGA?&#8221; I&#8217;m thinking about I&#8217;m like, you know, AIGA is only as strong as its weakest chapter. So if you&#8217;ve had a bad experience at your chapter and you feel like that&#8217;s precluding you from joining AIGA, I would completely understand that, because that was my experience even when I had joined. And this is sort of the part that sort of got me is know, prior to me being, quote unquote known, the local chapter didn&#8217;t want anything to do with me, wouldn&#8217;t talk to me, anything. Now that I&#8217;m on the national Diversity and Inclusion Task Force and people know about Revision Path and stuff, then they&#8217;re smiling in my face like, &#8220;oh, you should come and do this, you should want to do that.&#8221; And then we would try to do events together, and then they wouldn&#8217;t market the events. I don&#8217;t know. They would say one thing, do something else. At one point, I was trying to be the chapter&#8217;s VP of Diversity and Inclusion, and they were like, &#8220;well, we thought about it, but you don&#8217;t have a design degree.&#8221; And what does me not having a design degree have to do with anything? Clearly you see the advocacy work I&#8217;m doing in the community, the work that I&#8217;m doing talking to Black designers, the work I&#8217;m doing with National, but yet I didn&#8217;t go to art school, so therefore it&#8217;s just not valid. And it came to the point where I kind of really had to tell them, keep my name out your mouth. Don&#8217;t talk to me. Don&#8217;t put my name in conversation with anybody. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, you and I are persona non grata. Do not speak to me. </p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Dang. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been an AIGA member since 2017. I still talk with leadership; like they recently had their first Black executive director, Bennie F. Johnson. He and I are really close. So I was there throughout his tenure, just kind of talking with him, seeing how the organization changed, but he just left at the beginning of this year. So I don&#8217;t know what AIGA does. I don&#8217;t really care what they do. But I think about in terms know a lot of Black designers, particularly because I&#8217;m thinking about it through the focus of this show, really found community over the pandemic by joining other events or joining other sorts of groups that had sprung up, like the HUE Design Summit or Where Are The Black Designers? Or something like that. And now, like, a few years out, they&#8217;ve kind of died away. Not died away. That&#8217;s not the best way to put it. They&#8217;re not as active, I think, as they used to be. And so I still get some designers that are like, well, they want to find community. They&#8217;re trying to find it, and they look at AIGA. And they&#8217;re just like, is this, like, the only game in town? Because this is not it for us as designers, because there&#8217;s other issues with AIGA. Just in terms of there was a time when they didn&#8217;t recognize UX designers as designers. I still don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re a very proactive organization at all. Like, AIGA ain&#8217;t going to Congress. That ain&#8217;t happening. They are not doing that.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>I think AAF, I wouldn&#8217;t say they&#8217;re perfect by any means. I would say that it&#8217;s very similar in how each chapter kind of does its own thing, and you just hope that national stuff would trickle down into them. I think it&#8217;s always dependent on where that chapter is. Or also, do you have people on your board who&#8217;s going to hold them accountable to those things? Right. Like, I was diversity chair one year, and I was probably the only black person for a very long time on our board. And then as soon as I became president, I was like, where&#8217;s the black people? We bringing them. And so I would go and I would literally go out to places like, we have an HBCU here. And so I would approach them. I was like, do you all have design or any kind of program? And they were like, yeah, we do. And I got them to enter our awards. This is the first year they&#8217;d enter, and they won so many awards, and the joy on their face was so awesome, right? And so I was like, it depends on the people in the chapter, if they&#8217;re willing to go out and go do something about it. I don&#8217;t know. I guess the national can&#8217;t really hold everyone accountable. I think they try to, but I don&#8217;t see them going to every chapter and going, are you doing this? Are you doing, like, there&#8217;s certain things they have to do, but in terms of diversity and stuff, I think it&#8217;s really on who&#8217;s there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I see that. And, I mean, it&#8217;s sort of the same way. Like, you know, if I didn&#8217;t see Antoinette doing what she was doing with the Task Force and getting me on board was sort of the message, I wouldn&#8217;t have joined. So seeing someone that looks like you, that&#8217;s kind of in that position, helping to influence stuff, really does help. But it also sounds like for you, AAF has been just a positive force. I mean, it&#8217;s helped you out throughout your career, you&#8217;ve worked in these different leadership positions. Would you say that AAF has really been instrumental in kind of getting you to where you are today?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>I would say yes, very much, 100%. I think a lot of things that it&#8217;s like a continuous learning thing. Like when I wasn&#8217;t going to a conference that work was paying for, I was going to these club conferences and learning all these different things. I couldn&#8217;t tell you anything about data privacy before I went to any of this stuff where things outside of a normal designer would know because the more that you know and have in your tool belt, the more valuable you are, right? And so it&#8217;s like I can speak on a lot of things that I never probably would have spoke on before joining AAF.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, I want to switch gears here a little bit. I don&#8217;t want to just talk about design organizations and stuff. As I told you before we started recording, it&#8217;s just rare to find another designer from the same area where I grew up in. So I really want to learn more about you, about growing up in Montgomery and everything. Tell me about that as a designer.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>I will say that growing up in Montgomery, it was fine, but I also was in the majority who was like, as soon as I get a chance, I&#8217;m out, I&#8217;m out, I&#8217;m going out. I don&#8217;t know where it is, but I&#8217;m out. And so I thought I was, like, trying know until the reality of how much college costs hit me in the face. I was like, oh, well, I guess I&#8217;m going to school at AUM, which is local, Auburn University of Montgomery. I was like, okay, I&#8217;ll go there. They have a design program. Went there. And then towards the end, when I was getting ready to graduate, I was really like, in this whole, I got to get an internship. Like, I got to get something to get a job because no job will hire you without some sort of experience, right? And so I ended up getting an internship at I think it was called Southern Progress Corporation at the time. But it was basically Time Inc. had owned <i>Southern Living</i> magazine and <i>Coastal Living</i> magazine and all these Southern magazines at the time, and it was in Birmingham. </p>
<p>So I moved to Birmingham up there for that. And I was like, I&#8217;m going to stay in Birmingham. Birmingham is like an hour and a half away from Montgomery and like, the nearest biggest city probably. And so I was like, okay, I&#8217;m going to Birmingham. We&#8217;ll see what happens. And then it was 2008, also known as the recession, and no jobs were to be had because as I don&#8217;t know if people know creative jobs were the first to go. And so there were no jobs. I was interviewing for jobs left and right. It was just like a kind of depressing time. And so at that time, I had to put it down. I had to just like, okay, I&#8217;m going to apply for the job wherever it is. And I ended up applying for a job in Montgomery. And I was like, I want to go back to Montgomery. And I went, I applied for the job. They said yes. I was like, I could save money, moved back home, save money. I took this job, and that&#8217;s how I ended up back in Montgomery. And so I think for a while, I took it as a temporary pit stop, but I never would have thought that I would still be here until I started until I started kind of realizing what does design. Not just I think a lot of people, when they get out, they kind of just go, I&#8217;m going to work at this huge agency, or whatever. And there&#8217;s no agencies in Montgomery. Like, for real. There&#8217;s like a couple. That means everyone&#8217;s competing for those same jobs. And so I worked at this place called Henig Furs, which is funny. It&#8217;s a fur store in the South. And yeah, I was like, this is okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>It don&#8217;t get that cold down there for furs!</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got a good ten day window of cold that you can wear that fur. And they don&#8217;t do it. And they&#8217;re all in the Southeast. Like, there were stores all in the Southeast. And so they wanted an in-house designer. And I applied for the job, and I got it. And so I did that for a little over four and a half years. And so what I learned at that job was, like, I think we think of the glamorous part of being a designer when we&#8217;re out of school, oh, we&#8217;re just going to design all these cool things and stuff. And it&#8217;s like, no, you&#8217;re going to probably do some boring stuff for a while. And it was like retail design work. Like retail marketing. That&#8217;s what I was doing. </p>
<p>And so I&#8217;m learning all of this stuff that why didn&#8217;t I learn this in school? Like, the real stuff, right, is like, how back then, newspapers were still a thing. So then it was like, I was doing a lot of newspaper ad design. I was doing having to design mostly in black and white a lot of times was like, that was a learning curve for me for a while. And then we had at the time, they had a partnership with Belk, so sometimes they had like, little salons inside of Belk stores. So then it was partnering with Belk and making sure I&#8217;m adhering to Belk&#8217;s Design, right? And I&#8217;m also learning how to place radio ads. I&#8217;m writing scripts for ads on TV and radio. And how do you even place an ad on TV? All these little things that you need to know how to even run some sort of design marketing kind of startup. I&#8217;m learning from this job that&#8217;s like, in Montgomery, Alabama. Yeah, it&#8217;s just like all this we had to read it on a website, and it was like, how do you even go about that? I had no idea, and I figured it out, because at the time, I think we were saying I remember I kept pushing. I was like, hey, I think web is where we need to go. People aren&#8217;t shopping in stores anymore. And I want to say primarily, a lot of their businesses are online now. </p>
<p>And so, yeah, it&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m learning all these things that are outside of design because they don&#8217;t tell you you need to know more about stuff other than just design. And so I&#8217;m learning all these things. I stayed there a little over four and a half years, and then a job at Southern Poverty Law Center came up, and I had interviewed with them right out of college, and clearly I was rejected from that. But I interviewed again with them, and I got the job because of all this stuff that I had learned at this small shop. Yeah, they were like, oh, you know how to do this. And we&#8217;re also talking about redesign a website and blah, blah, blah. And I was like, yeah, I&#8217;ve been doing all this scrappy work. And so that&#8217;s what sold me to get this job at Southern Poverty Law Center. And that job, I love that job, and I did it for ten years. It was interesting. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been in an in house of that caliber before. I think <i>Southern Living</i> was kind of almost a little it gave you a little bit of in house feel. But I was on the advertising side when I was an intern, so it was like those ads in the back of the magazine that no one looks like. That&#8217;s the stuff I was doing. I wasn&#8217;t doing the pretty editorial work. And so at Southern Poverty Law Center, we had a full in house team. Nothing in the organization got done, and it had to come through us, the creative team. That was video work, that was any ads. Like, everything, if it was going to be public facing, it had to be touched by our team. And so we were a full shop. I always wanted to work in nonprofit because just being in the retail life is just, what is this for? You start questioning your life, you&#8217;re like, Why am I doing this? It was at a nonprofit, which was even better. And yeah, it was just a good experience. I did that for about ten years, and so that&#8217;s why I ended up staying, because I had this job that was paying me well. It was in Montgomery. It was, like, mission driven. I was like, oh, why do I need to leave? This is great.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I want to go back to&#8230;I mean, you&#8217;ve covered a lot of ground, but I want to go back to just like I guess well, I guess this is sort of full circle, now that I think about, know, growing up in Montgomery. Like, you said, you left, you came back, you stayed in Alabama, you stayed in Montgomery&#8217;s and built your career there. Why is it important for you to stay there? As opposed to say, like, oh, I&#8217;m going know, maybe move to Atlanta or to New York or somewhere where there might be bigger opportunities. Is there more about staying in Montgomery than just the job opportunity?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I would say definitely not a martyr for staying in Montgomery. I would say that my number one would be cost of living. Cost of living is just compared to other places I&#8217;m okay, then, you know, if I take cost of living and stuff out of it, I would say that especially when I was doing stuff with AAF and engaging with all these designers and stuff in college and just talking to them and, what do you want to do? And I would just always tell them, like, hey, design is everywhere that you can think of it could possibly be. I don&#8217;t think people even realize in house was, like, a thing. Right. And so I think for me, it&#8217;s almost proven, like, you can have a good career and still be in Montgomery. </p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t like, I think, everyone&#8217;s thoughts of what they think they should be doing. You can do it from think, but the problem is it&#8217;s not as out there. Right. You have to find the opportunities. They&#8217;re not just out there going here&#8217;s, all these great opportunities, right. You have to find the opportunities of Montgomery. And I think that&#8217;s the difference between going somewhere to a larger city or, like, Atlanta or something, right. You see opportunities galore, but you have to find them here. And I think Montgomery also has just been they&#8217;ve been having kind of almost like a little bit of a renaissance in the last ten years of just trying to build it up and trying to get people, encourage them to stay. Particularly this creative community that we have, a huge arts community that&#8217;s blown up in the last few years. I just think there are people here who now are like, it&#8217;s not just one or two. There&#8217;s a lot of people who are just advocating for people to see us, like, see Montgomery and just, hey, there&#8217;s stuff here. You just have to find it. It&#8217;s not going to come to you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Wow. I grew up in Selma. Selma is 50 miles away from Montgomery, and just growing up, Montgomery was always the destination because Selma didn&#8217;t have the things Montgomery had. Like, Selma was almost like an extended suburb in a way, because we didn&#8217;t have a movie theater. So if you wanted to go to the movies, you had to drive up 80, go to Carmike Cinemas 8. If you wanted to go to a mall&#8230;Selma kind of had a mall, but it wasn&#8217;t the Montgomery Mall. It wasn&#8217;t that. If you wanted to see a play or something, maybe there might be something at Walton Theater, but it&#8217;s like, fifth graders or whatever. If you wanted to see, like, Shakespeare, there&#8217;s Alabama Shakespeare Festival, which I mean, when I first saw Alabama Shakespeare Festival as a kid, I was blown away. I think I mentioned this before we recorded. It was the first time I felt immersed in a fully designed space. I&#8217;m like, this is like a theater. And then, of course, I learned, like, it&#8217;s one of the, I think, ten Shakespeare festivals in the world. And I&#8217;m like, Why? Would there be one in Alabama?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I knew that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s so beautiful with the water. And I remember going to see plays there. Like, we would have field trips there all the time. And even then, when I was in marching band; there&#8217;s no music shop in Alabama. We had to go to Art&#8217;s on East Boulevard. We had to go up there to get me mouthpieces and slide oil and stuff like so, like, Montgomery to me, was always, like, the destination in a way, because there was just art and culture and museums and shows, and we didn&#8217;t have a television station in Selma. Everything comes from Montgomery, WSFA, all that sort of stuff. So Hot 105, the radio station&#8230;all of that was just&#8230;Montgomery was the destination. And so it&#8217;s interesting for you to talk about how it&#8217;s coming up in this renaissance, because, of course, there&#8217;s, like, the civil rights museum. Not a civil rights museum. It&#8217;s a justice museum.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>There the EJI &#8212; Equal Justice Initiative.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that museum is there. I know that there&#8217;s been a lot of activity around trying to build up that Selma to Montgomery corridor. Like, I know, especially in Lowndes County, like, they have an interpretive center. They&#8217;re trying to build all that stuff up and everything. Montgomery, to me, has just always been the destination. I bought my first video game in Montgomery. I went to my first big mall in Montgomery, saw my first, like, theater show, but also movie theater in I mean, to me, Montgomery was like, it I mean, Birmingham was, of course, the big, big city. Yeah, but in Selma, it was like&#8230;Montgomery is just like right there. You know? </p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to hear that perspective as someone who has been from I&#8217;m from Montgomery, and so a lot of people here like, &#8220;oh, we&#8217;re too small. Nothing happens here.&#8221; But then to hear you from someone who&#8217;s from Selma going, everything was in Montgomery.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Everything was in&#8211;</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>You probably need to give that talk to some other people that live here!</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Listen, we didn&#8217;t have a bookstore, so when I was trying to learn&#8230;I mean, we had a library. So, I mean, a library is not a bookstore, but the only kind of books we bought was whatever might be in Walmart. And that&#8217;s like, what romance novels or something like that. Scholastic book fair. And the library. Like, there wasn&#8217;t a bookstore, whereas you go to Montgomery, there&#8217;s a Books-A-Million, and Waldenbooks was there. When I started learning how to code. This was like mid 90s or something like that. There were a couple of books out and stuff, and the library didn&#8217;t have anything. And I remember going on a field trip and going to I think it was a Walden Books. It was either a Waldenbooks or a Books-A-Million to get my first computer book.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, we used to have a Barnes and Noble. It probably was that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I&#8217;m curious, what high school did you go to?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Robert E. Lee. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Okay. All right. I mean, Selma only had Selma High School. I mean, there&#8217;s Dallas County High School, but that&#8217;s different. That&#8217;s the county high school.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>We have a ton of high schools. We&#8217;ve got Robert E. Lee&#8211;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, and mostly named after Confederate folks.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Confederate people! exactly! Like, back then, I wasn&#8217;t too hard about it, and I was like, yeah, Lee, that&#8217;s where I go. And now it&#8217;s like, oh, yeah, there was Lee. It&#8217;S a lot. Like, they&#8217;re planning on renaming the schools, so that&#8217;s going to be interesting.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, we had Selma High School, and that was just in the so, like, we had city high schools and county high schools. They were rivals of some sort. So in the city, there was only selma High School was, like, the city high school. And then outside in the county, you had Keith High School, you had Southside, and you had Dallas County High School. But then you also had I guess you could call this, like the honestly, what we called it growing up was the White School, which was Morgan Academy. And it was a private I guess private-ish school. But then that was named after a Klansman that&#8217;s named after &#8212; John T. Morgan. So, like, we just didn&#8217;t fool with them. Never the &#8216;twain shall meet. Like, I think Selma&#8217;s main rival was Southside, because it was just know, city versus county, that kind of yeah, yeah. No, I remember. I&#8217;ve marched at the stadium in&#8211;</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Crampton Bowl.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Crampton Bowl. I&#8217;ve been there. I&#8217;ve been to the Turkey Day Classic. All of that. All of that.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>You&#8217;re bringing it all back!</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ve been there. Absolutely. So it&#8217;s great to hear that Montgomery is kind of having this renaissance. Like, tell me more about the creative community there.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>So definitely not me, but it&#8217;s spearheaded by a few other groups that have really more of the fine arts community. I have been so impressed. It started with maybe, like, throwing a couple of murals up, and now we&#8217;ve got a ton of murals up in the city, and then they kind of have these kind of art groups who are just there&#8217;s one group, King&#8217;s Canvas, that I really love, love Kevin King. He created it. His group is mainly on the West Side and where people don&#8217;t that&#8217;s not a thing that people think about, but he&#8217;s been really advocating for creative place making, meaning community and culture can be created if you bring arts into it. And so he&#8217;s been really doing a lot for the city. There&#8217;s another group called 21 Dreams. They&#8217;ve also been doing a lot. And so it&#8217;s just been a really good time. If you&#8217;re like a fine artist, I would say design too, because a lot of designers are also they do fine art, but they also are mixed up in that as well. And so it&#8217;s a good time to be a creative in the city if you just get involved.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And like you said, there&#8217;s the schools that also have design programs. Like, you went to AUM, but then also Alabama State is in know, so you&#8217;ve got at least colleges that also have these programs too. Like, you were part of the AIGA student chapter at AUM, right?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, we started a student chapter. I don&#8217;t pretty sure that didn&#8217;t last, but we had started a student chapter because there wasn&#8217;t one. And the nearest AIGA chapter to us was in Birmingham. And so, yeah, we started one know, we were like, we want to be a part of a design association. And at the time, I think when I had remember hearing about AF, but I was like, I&#8217;m a designer, I need to be a design thing. Design things is what I need to be. And so we did a little bit with it, but I really don&#8217;t remember a lot of the time, like, what we did. I don&#8217;t think we did very much other than start the chapter. And so, yeah, I think there&#8217;s opportunity wherever you can go. We even have two year colleges and stuff. We have one of those who has like a design program. It&#8217;s everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah. When you sort of look back at the span of, your know, even like your time at AUM to Henig to Southern Poverty Law Center to now with Jeremiah Program, how would you say you&#8217;ve evolved as a creative over the years?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>I would say that definitely for me, I love doing like I still like doing it, but I think I&#8217;ve definitely fallen more into creative leadership. I just love kind of like that art direction kind of stuff. And so I&#8217;ve also kind of realized there are people who are better than me, and I&#8217;m okay with that, right. I&#8217;m okay with getting the best people who know how to do the job, but I still have that eye for direction of where we should go and stuff. And so I follow more into creative leadership over the years and managing designers and other creative people. I really have enjoyed that part of where my career has gotten to, and I would like to keep doing more of just, like, creative leadership. I don&#8217;t know, maybe far down the road teaching, maybe. But I just feel like because I just feel like at least when I remember in my college, feel like they&#8217;re just not teaching you what you need to know when you get out, you know, the basics. But it&#8217;s like, I need some real life application here.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>And you don&#8217;t feel like that&#8217;s like.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Being taught, at least when I was in school, it could have improved. I mean, the program has been around for a while now, and it could have improved. I just felt like when I was in school, I was having to do a lot of things on the side on my own to try to figure it out. And we had a teacher retire in the middle of my year also. And so we had a new professor came in who was just she just came from an agency. And so when she came in, I will say we saw more practical application type projects. We started doing that kind of stuff. And so, I don&#8217;t know, maybe I feel like I was slighted because she didn&#8217;t come in until toward the end of my year. So I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s still there. And a great friend of mine, and I will say that she probably brought a lot to the students after me, for real. But when I was in, it was like still a lot of old school teaching. And so not to say there&#8217;s anything wrong with it, but it was like I needed it to evolve with where time was going.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s something with, I think, a lot of design curriculums. Like, you can teach the basics, of course, you can teach theory and composition and all that sort of stuff. But so much of design now, I think is wrapped in tech in some way, whether that&#8217;s product or UX or some digital form. It&#8217;s hard to be, I think, just a visual designer, maybe, because the expectation is that something you do has to be tied to a tech part, something with technology. And I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s being really taught. They&#8217;ll teach you the basics and then you&#8217;re kind of on your own once you get out there.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, I would have really appreciate now a class where they teach you Canva. Because I was like, everybody&#8217;s like, Canva is going to take your job. No, Canva&#8217;s not going to take my job. But Canva has a place in the world. And it&#8217;s like now I&#8217;m definitely one of those designers that&#8217;s like, turn my nose up at it, but I&#8217;m like, no, it has a place in the world, and we all need to adapt to it, unfortunately.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Now, outside of work, I see you love Disney and Marvel and all that kind, like comic geek culture stuff. Do you really ever have an opportunity to combine that with your everyday work?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s funny. Anytime I give a presentation, I like to let people know that that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m into. If it&#8217;s a presentation on something slightly boring. I always intro with hey, and it&#8217;s usually like a picture of me at Avengers campus at Disneyland or it&#8217;s just like, hey, I just need you to know a couple of things about me off the top. Number one, I&#8217;m a blerd. If you don&#8217;t know what that is, that&#8217;s a Black nerd, right? So I kind of break the ice conversations and I try to introduce it that way. I also would say that part of me starting like a blog and stuff too, was me trying to incorporate my love of design and building websites and stuff like that into trying to marry the two and my love of talking about it. I try to pour a lot of that into that. If I don&#8217;t get to do it through work or they know that I&#8217;m good for them in something, even if it&#8217;s just like a quick zoom meeting, they know I&#8217;m good for them in something that&#8217;s going to be very nerd culture related. So I try to throw it in there as like a personality thing. But no, we&#8217;re not up there making Marvel movies at work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I mean, I know with like what you said with the Jeremiah Project, like the work has to do with family. So I didn&#8217;t know if maybe you&#8217;re able to kind of introduce some more family-friendly Marvel or Disney. I mean, Disney is family-friendly, of course, but any sort of way to sort of incorporate those two. I was just curious about that.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>No, no. We keep it professional.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What advice would you give out there to someone? Like they&#8217;re hearing your story, they&#8217;re hearing about your career, and they want to follow in your footsteps. Like, what would you tell them?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>Oh, man. I would say that opportunities won&#8217;t come to you. You have to go find them, and you have to do the work to go find them. I can tell you I&#8217;ve spent many a time, even before out of college, leaving a little bit after, just finding opportunities and sometimes just even creating them, even when there&#8217;s not there, because sometimes you creating stuff on your own will get you noticed. I think you have to find the opportunities. You can&#8217;t just expect them to come to you. It&#8217;s work being a creative, right? It takes a minute to get you unless you&#8217;re just really good. It takes a minute for people to put that trust in you, to hire you as a creative person. Right? And so I also think being a creative is more than just your ability to make something look good on the screen. I think also too, that some of that leadership and communication style also is a big part of being a creative. Like if you can&#8217;t talk about your work, if you can&#8217;t defend your work, if you can&#8217;t also take critique and criticism that communication is very important and sometimes even that part, they&#8217;ll see that before they&#8217;ll see your actual. Work that you&#8217;re doing. So I just think that ultimately, you have to do the work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>What do you want the next chapter of your story to be? Like? I feel like you&#8217;ve accomplished a lot so far in your career, and especially now you&#8217;re at this new nonprofit. What do you want the next chapter of your story to be? Like, what kind of work do you want to do?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>I would say career wise, I can&#8217;t think of anything else that I would want to be doing other than teaching. At some point. I think I like connecting with students, and right when life hasn&#8217;t slapped them in the face yet, so all their ideas are fresh and new, and you&#8217;re like, yes, energize me with your energy. I would like to think I would like to eventually go that route. But personally, though, I think I just want to push myself a little bit more to learn things that I&#8217;m still not like, I, at one point was like, I should learn. UX. And then I quickly gave up on it. But I think I just want to explore. I&#8217;m getting more into video editing. I&#8217;ve done a little bit, and I&#8217;m getting a little bit more into that and just trying to add things to my tool belt to kind of keep me going. Because I think most people, if you&#8217;re a creative, you know, you can&#8217;t just stop at what you learn one time, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s very true. It&#8217;s very true. Just to kind of wrap things up here. I mean, we&#8217;ve talked about so much stuff, but where can people find out more information about you, about your work? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>You can find me on my website. It&#8217;s ohheyitsmekt.com. That&#8217;s also my Instagram and Twitter handle. Yeah, that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m at.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>All right, sounds good. Well, Kristina Turner, I want to thank you so, so much for coming on the show. Like I said earlier, it&#8217;s just been so rare for me to find another designer that&#8217;s, like, right from around the area where I grew up. So I applaud you so much for being such a badass working creative in Montgomery. And, I mean, I don&#8217;t mean that just because of Montgomery being a smaller city, but the next generation, and I would say even the current generation of.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>Designers, creatives and stuff, people need to see that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>They really need to see that. Because I think about myself growing up, I didn&#8217;t know anything about design. I mean, I liked to draw. I couldn&#8217;t really draw, but I did a lot of stuff with magazines, and I worked on my school newspaper and yearbook and stuff. And this was at a time when computers were just starting to become a thing. We&#8217;re talking, like, mid to late ninety s. I graduated high school in &#8217;99, and so there were no sorts of examples for me to see of, like, oh, this is a working person doing creative stuff. I had to leave to find it, to see it somewhere else. And so I think it&#8217;s super important that what you&#8217;re doing, you&#8217;re kind of being the symbol in a way, maybe inadvertently, but you&#8217;re being the symbol for others to see that. Yeah, you can be here in Montgomery and live a fun, fulfilled creative life doing work that you love. And that is so inspirational to me. I know it&#8217;s got to be inspirational to other people. And again, I just want to thank you so much for coming on the show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b></p>
<p>I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Kristina Turner:</b></p>
<p>No, thank you for geeking out about Montgomery with me.</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Hey, everyone. I&#8217;m Ashley Fletcher. I&#8217;m a graphic designer and illustrator based in Washington, DC. by way of Prince George&#8217;s County, Maryland. I have a passion for visual storytelling and designing with intention and alignment. I&#8217;m also the owner of Goods Made by Digitrillnana, an art shop dedicated to celebrating culture and art through greeting cards, art prints, and more. Maurice, thank you so much for having me. Listening to this podcast has been a beacon of light for my career.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow. Well, thank you. I love to start off the interview that way. Wow. How&#8217;s your year been going so far? How&#8217;s 2023 been?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
My year has been great. 2023 has been a year of really Repivoting, I think, my creative journey. So I&#8217;m excited to see what this new process has in store. I feel like I&#8217;ve checked off a lot of boxes. Sometimes when you&#8217;re always working and just grinding things out, you don&#8217;t really realize, hey, I accomplished all of these things. Also, this is my first year. I&#8217;m a breast cancer survivor, so this is my first year without any surgeries. So I am looking forward to what 2023 has to offer as far as my overall healing and well being as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, wow. Well, congratulations on beating breast cancer.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What plans do you have for the summer?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
This summer I am going to be working just a few more events. I&#8217;m trying to add a few more events for my art shop. So I&#8217;ll be at Broccoli City Festival in July. Super excited because the past years I applied and I wasn&#8217;t accepted. So it&#8217;s always beautiful to see when things start to align and check that off. And I don&#8217;t have any vacations planned, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll go to New York for one of these amazing, like, Brooklyn Museum art nights and some little local travel as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If you make it up to New York, you should definitely check out the Poster House Museum.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Yes. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I get their emails. I&#8217;ve done some events with them as well, but they always have really great exhibitions. I haven&#8217;t been to the museum itself yet, but I always recommend people to go there. So if you get a chance to check it out, you should.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Yeah, I definitely will.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Let&#8217;s talk a little bit about your current job. You&#8217;re a graphic designer at Brookfield Properties. Tell me about that.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Yeah, so they are kind of a real estate house. They work with everything from logistics warehouses to residential commercials to commercial property. So I am a part of their in house team. It&#8217;s a fairly small design team in DC. They have about three designers in New York, I believe it&#8217;s four or five. And then we also have designers that are working remotely and all over the world as well. It&#8217;s an international company, so yeah, it&#8217;s been really cool. They have a beautiful office. They received some awards for the best eco friendly, sustainable office. So very beautiful space to be working in and really inspiring. Lots of windows that I love because working at my when I was freelancing, I was in the house all the time, not a lot of suntime. So it&#8217;s been a beautiful shift. And I create a variety of things from eblast variety of I just did some graphics for a Summer Sounds event that they have at their properties in Denver. So really wide variety of designer projects that I&#8217;ve worked on.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, very nice. And so it sounds like you&#8217;re in the office then working. It&#8217;s not like a remote or hybrid thing.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Actually, it&#8217;s hybrid. So I&#8217;m three days in the office and two days at home. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How&#8217;s that been for you?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
It&#8217;s lovely. I love it. After freelancing again, stepping back into the corporate world, I realized how much I miss being around people on a regular basis. So having that balance has been really beneficial to me, I think. And then also the balance of not having to worry about commute for work for those two days because commuting can also be pretty draining depending on how far you are from your job and things like that. So it&#8217;s a really great balance.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m sort of weighing now that I&#8217;m back on the job market and looking because I&#8217;ve done remote work for so long and this is like before the pandemic. I&#8217;ve been working remotely since 2008. So it&#8217;s not that I am averse to going back into an office, but Atlanta traffic is no joke. I&#8217;m really trying to think of like, if I work somewhere in the office, is it going to be somewhere that I can not have like an hour long commute and that&#8217;s even if I take the train as opposed to driving or something like that. But it sounds like you&#8217;ve got a good set up, though, with the hybrid.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
I do. And thankfully my commute is very beautiful. It depends on the day, of course. Traffic in DC is pretty tough, but it usually doesn&#8217;t take me longer than maybe 45 minutes. On a rough day, maybe an hour, it&#8217;s really nice. And when traffic is sweet, it&#8217;s like 20 minutes it might take me to get home. So it&#8217;s very nice commute. I remember when I was working way back when I worked for the government and I was traveling, I think like 2 hours away and oh my gosh, I don&#8217;t know how I did it. I don&#8217;t know how I did it. I commend all the people that have to commute whether driving or taking public transportation. It&#8217;s tough.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I&#8217;m right across the street from a train station, so it will be easy for me to get on the train. But everyone knows Atlanta&#8217;s mass transit is not the best. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s probably gotten a lot better, at least in terms of the trains. I can&#8217;t say for the buses though. But I want to make sure if I do get back to a hybrid thing that it&#8217;s in a situation where I don&#8217;t have a long commute. It&#8217;s not going to take me forever to get to and from work because like you said, that part can be draining, especially if it&#8217;s not a good commute to get there, like, if you&#8217;re passing through a certain part of town or anything like that.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Yeah, I had an interesting experience a couple of years ago when I was taking public transportation, and ever since then, I was like, I have to be able to drive to work because it&#8217;s so draining. You don&#8217;t know what kind of experience you might have that day on or off the train. And also for me, I absorb a lot of people&#8217;s energy. So having all of that various energy around me, sometimes it&#8217;s like, wait a minute. By the time I get to work, I&#8217;m like, okay, I need to decompress. I need some sage going on, maybe a little nap. So, yeah, definitely grateful. I think this job came at a time where a lot of things aligned for me. So if you are on the job hunt and you&#8217;re having a tough time, I just say manifest, write those things down that you want, that you&#8217;re looking for those qualities in that space, because those were deal breakers for me. So, yeah, definitely grateful to have this job come across. And the team is really awesome. Everyone is super helpful, friendly. My first day, like, the welcome, it was just so beautiful. So really grateful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. What does I guess, like, a regular day look like? Because it sounds like you&#8217;re working on a lot of different type of design things for the company. You mentioned e-blasts and a number of other things.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Yeah. So we utilize Monday as a software for a lot of our projects. So I&#8217;ll come in most times, I know have an idea of what I&#8217;ll be working on, so just prioritizing those projects based on their deadlines. Sometimes I&#8217;m checking in with the marketing team, so our design team is kind of underneath the marketing team, so checking in with those requests, asking any questions that I need, kind of gathering that designer brief of, okay, here&#8217;s all the components to what I&#8217;ll be creating and what I need. And then I&#8217;ll just go in from there. A lot of our materials, because book build is pretty established, some things have been created already. So I might be going in and tweaking an already existing design. I might be creating something from scratch. Like, I designed some exterior and interior graphics for the Highlight Center in Houston. If you&#8217;re in Houston, check it out. It&#8217;s very nice. Lovely work. I&#8217;m really proud of myself for that. So I spent a lot of time sketching, carving out time in the day for research. Also, again, asking those different questions with the marketing team of things that they needed that I may not have gotten in the brief in ideation sharing that with my creative director and that process of ideation and revisions. So that&#8217;s usually what it&#8217;s like. They also have something called activated. And so they have various events throughout the office. One day we had, like, boba tea. They may have I think they have a Pride event. Actually, today they have a Pride event. So different various different events to get you engaged with other people in the office and the other tenants that are in the office. And Google is in their office as well. So it&#8217;s a cool way to engage and break up the work day. So, yeah, that&#8217;s usually what I&#8217;m doing, attending some of those events during lunchtime, getting some free ice cream, some free boba tea, and going back to the office and zoning into some of the deadlines that I have.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I mean, honestly, as you describe it, it sounds like the ideal type of sort of design position for where you&#8217;re at in your career. It&#8217;s open to the point that you can sort of work hybrid, but then you&#8217;re also working on all of these different types of things, so you&#8217;re stretching your skills in other ways. And the team is nice and there&#8217;s like, fun, engaging activities for you all to do. That&#8217;s good. That&#8217;s great. Actually, I wish a lot of designers kind of had that type of set up because it&#8217;s really fun. I mean, it makes work fun in that aspect because you&#8217;re not so keyed into the work that you can&#8217;t sort of know what else is going on in the company with other people and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Right. And I think sometimes for people, that can be the difference from in house or being at an agency. One of my coworkers had shared agency life. It can be a lot more hectic depending on where you are. So definitely want to consider that when you&#8217;re looking for places to work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, before Brookfield, you were doing freelance design. Actually, you&#8217;re still doing freelance design. You mentioned that a bit earlier. Talk to me about that. Like, how do you juggle that freelance work with doing your nine to five work?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Yeah, so when I first started at Brookfield, I had a freelance project that I was doing. And honestly, it was a little hectic because I was adjusting so much to being back in the office. I went from grad school right into freelance, and that was also during COVID So I graduated in 2020 in the height of COVID So it was a lot of different things were happening within the work industry. So now I&#8217;m able to kind of set some time aside and really just being intentional about my timing. Weekends, I&#8217;m usually working, and that&#8217;s okay. Sometimes I take a break, I&#8217;ll spend one day kind of doing letting things fly. So if I want to go hang out with my family or get pizza, whatever, just go outside and take a break. I definitely do that. I prioritize that, especially nowadays, that&#8217;s kind of priority of getting that break. But definitely timing. Like, I&#8217;ll come home some days if I have my art shop. So I&#8217;m doing a lot of work for that. I&#8217;ll take a little nap, maybe I&#8217;ll get home maybe around seven or something like that, take a nap, get things back started, maybe around ten. And depending on how my creative flow goes, I&#8217;ll end around one. Or I might keep going until I&#8217;m like, okay, you need to take a little nap before work. So it definitely depends on the project. It depends on how I&#8217;m feeling, my well being and everything. So if I&#8217;m tired, I&#8217;ll try to push myself just a little, but I got to get my rest because you create much better when you&#8217;re rested. So it&#8217;s been an interesting time. I&#8217;ll say adjusting with nine to five in freelance, but again, scheduling and being intentional with my time. So if that means I have to put my phone in a drawer so I&#8217;m not checking social media or being distracted by notifications, I&#8217;ll do that. Yeah, it&#8217;s very helpful.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. One thing with trying to make that balance is, I mean, of course you have your regular nine to five work. That&#8217;s the stuff you know you&#8217;re going to do, because that&#8217;s probably the most money that you&#8217;re making. You have your health benefits tied to that, so you don&#8217;t want to lose that. But I remember those days of trying to balance freelance at nine to five, and it&#8217;s not an easy thing to do, especially if your freelance work starts to outpace your nine to five work. Yeah, I remember when I was starting to do that, honestly, back then they called it teleworking, this was like 2007 or something. And they would say, oh yeah, you could work three days in the office, two days out. But then the two days that I wasn&#8217;t in the office, I never did work. I only did freelance work because when I&#8217;m at home, I&#8217;m thinking, okay, I can sort of juggle doing both. Because your mindset is just different in an office, I find, than when you&#8217;re doing it at home. At home, and this is pre-pandemic, of course, but at home you&#8217;re around your creature comforts: your bed, your couch, all this sort of stuff. And it&#8217;s tougher to kind of get into that work mindset. I remember even at the beginning of the pandemic when I interviewed folks just kind of asking them, how are you getting into work mode at home? Because it can be so difficult to do that. It took me quite a while to be able to juggle that, to be able to switch off work brain and go to freelance brain and try to balance those things. It can be pretty tough.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Yeah, it can. And I think as designers, we&#8217;re constantly creating, we&#8217;re constantly problem solving. And I don&#8217;t think we give ourselves enough grace sometimes of multitasking with that. When you&#8217;re always problem solving, it can definitely create burnout. That&#8217;s why, again, for me, I&#8217;m going to take a nap. If it&#8217;s one thing that I&#8217;m going to do, I&#8217;m going to take a nap. And sometimes that helps and sometimes it doesn&#8217;t. In between working and starting with all my freelance projects, I think too, being honest with yourself about your time and also with the client. For me, I was working on a project, I started a project right before I found out that I was going to be hired for this new position. So I had to let the client know, hey, my schedule is definitely going to change. Some days I wasn&#8217;t able to check my email at all and having to pace that time, or some days I would be working really late and so I&#8217;m scheduling emails and check ins with clients to go out the next morning. And then not to mention for me, I had a lot of family stuff happening at that time too, like dealing with aging grandparents and family members that can also wait into your time. So I just had to be honest with myself and say, hey, okay, this is where we are. And also therapy. I have an amazing therapist. She&#8217;s like, you should spend some time not freelancing and take a break. This month I think is like the first month that I&#8217;m not actively seeking freelance work and hopefully that I&#8217;ll be able to shift a little bit back because there&#8217;s definitely a lot of projects that I&#8217;m interested in doing. But yeah, she told me, she said you need to take a break. You need to go ahead and just enjoy this new chapter a little bit before you continue and get back into work.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If I can give just a tiny bit of advice there. If you get to the point where you can sort of see that you have enough money to hire an assistant, like a virtual assistant, do it. Do it and just have them do basic tasks like responding back to messages. Like for me, responding back to emails timely was always the thing that kind of caught me up. It was like, oh, I forgot to send this. And I sent maybe something a little too late. If you can afford it, do that to handle the smaller mundane tasks that you can sort of take off your plate so you can then focus on the creative work.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Yeah, I suck at that. I definitely agree. And I can&#8217;t wait until I have evolved. The practice has evolved and I can do that as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So I want to learn more about you and about your journey as a designer. So we&#8217;re going to kind of take things back to the beginning. Are you originally from the DC area?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Yes, so I&#8217;ve lived in Maryland pretty much all of my life. So yeah, I&#8217;m Maryland through and through. Went to high school in Maryland, went to college two times in Maryland, so yeah, Maryland, DC native.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Did you grow up around a lot of design and everything as a kid?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
No, I didn&#8217;t. But I grew up around a lot of entrepreneurs and creatives. So my mom is a hairstylist, and I think sometimes we don&#8217;t give our hairstylists the credit they deserve as far as being creative. What she does and creates with hair is amazing, from cuts to color. So seeing her seeing her as an entrepreneur, navigating having owning her own salon. My father also was in the carpentry industry when seeing him navigate and just creating things with his hands. My grandfather is a fine artist. He&#8217;s also a jack of all trades from cooking. There&#8217;s so many paintings in my grandparents house that he&#8217;s created. He&#8217;s upholstered chairs. So I&#8217;ve been surrounded by creatives without really knowing. And a lot of the times that I spent in my mom&#8217;s hair salon was looking through Black hair magazines and publications. So I spent a lot of time unknowingly around ingesting design without really knowing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, hairstylist. And I would say also, like, seamstresses. I&#8217;m gendering it by saying that, but, like, people that can sew and everything. Yeah, top tier people really like underestimate, I think especially probably hair more than than sewing. But, like, yeah, everyone&#8217;s got to get a cut. Everybody has to get their hair done at some point for something that&#8217;s a very lucrative I mean, it&#8217;s a lucrative thing, but it is something I think we can kind of in our community probably take for granted a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
And the community that they bring, especially Black hair salons and barbershops like, it&#8217;s a sense of community there. They&#8217;re using our hair in a sense, it&#8217;s like a bleak canvas. You might have some different scalp situations going on or different things with hair loss and all types of things, and they&#8217;re supposed to create something out of that. You can&#8217;t get much more creative than that. And it&#8217;s a lot of risk with what they do. They cut your hair wrong or you don&#8217;t like what they do, you might lose a client. It might create a tough relationship. So my hats are off to what they&#8217;re able to do day in and day out, using their hands.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you mentioned going to college in Maryland. You went to Salisbury University, and you majored in graphic design. Since you kind of grew up around all these creatives and entrepreneurs, did you already sort of have a sense like, this is what I want to study, or did you kind of fall into that once you got to Salisbury?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
So I fell into that after I got to Salisbury. So in high school, I took a yearbook course for juniors my junior and senior year. And my junior year, I went to yearbook camp, and I was introduced to the process of design thinking again, I was collaging and really looking into fashion magazines. Like, I loved Vogue, all of those magazines, the models, just the visual storytelling from that. And so your book introduced me to this thing, like, oh, you can create a design and a publication on this program, and it&#8217;s printed and what the print process looks like. And I really loved it, and I thrived in it from the interviewing, interviewing different people from high school, and photography. I really loved photography. I took a photography course in high school, so by the time I got to college, I didn&#8217;t really know what I wanted to do. I was like, well, I kind of like marketing, so I&#8217;ll just do business administration with the track in marketing, I realized there&#8217;s a bunch of accounting courses and a lot of math involved. I said, okay, let&#8217;s be real with yourself here about what you really want to do. And so I started to think about how much joy your book brought me, like being able to wear these multiple hats of one day you&#8217;re shooting and take capturing moments, and then the other day you&#8217;re dabbling in copywriting and creating captions, and then you&#8217;re dabbling in creative layout and design. And I called my mom and I said, I think I want to design magazines. I don&#8217;t know what it is who does that, but I think that&#8217;s what I want to do. And so I looked through the mass head of some magazine, I don&#8217;t remember which one, and I found the title graphic designer, and I had a title to put with the thing. I checked if my school was offering any art or graphic design, and they did. That&#8217;s some alignment right there, because it could have been a whole different situation. And I switched. I was like, if I&#8217;m going to spend four years learning, I want to learn something that I&#8217;m interested in. So I switched to graphic design with the minor in marketing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. How was your time in general there at Salisbury? Like, once you switched over, do you find that they really kind of prepared you as a designer?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
I don&#8217;t think&#8230;so. I went to Salisbury &#8212; it&#8217;s a PWI &#8212; and their population at the university of Black students was pretty small at the time. So of course you have the nuances with that. And then I started in 2010. For me, the design industry was completely different than where it grew. By 2014, in graphic design one, we were sketching things on paper. Then we had to color it with colored pencil, then put it into using the light box, and then putting it into design software. So curriculum was very early on of those kind of foundational processes. So by the time I graduated, because for me, I felt like there was a lack of mentorship in the curriculum and preparedness. I don&#8217;t think I was prepared at all. I think sometimes with certain schools and structure and curriculum, if you&#8217;re not a stellar designer off the bat, some people might not nurture their skill set or say, hey, let me help you find your way. And there was actually an incident that I had with an instructor that he had said something really racist towards another student for a design. We had a design critique and it was just like really off putting. And so when you have those different nuances and situations and you can&#8217;t connect necessarily with your instructors, it&#8217;s very hard then to rely on them for help and for them to see you as just a student that is trying to just make a living out of this. And also, I think that the pace of Salisbury is a different pace from DC that I&#8217;ve experienced. And so people are enjoying life out there. It&#8217;s not too far from the beach, they&#8217;re chilling. It&#8217;s a very chill vibe there compared to how the design industry is now. So all of those things I left school not really knowing where to go, what I wanted to do in design. Again, at that time, there were a lot of traditional forms of design. Digital design wasn&#8217;t really a thing. Yeah, so I graduated and I worked at a beauty shop cosmopros that my mom frequented for all of her hair supply needs. I worked there for a few months. I was a winter graduate, so I worked there for a few months, and then I got a job as an administrative assistant at a medical association. So, yeah, definitely didn&#8217;t get a job right off the bat or really know what design looked for me outside of what I was learning in undergrad. I will say though, I did gain a lot of experience. I did designer for a lot of the organizations on campus, like MPHC and some of the other organizations that I was a part of. So I was able to create and explore what my design practice looked like, what I wanted to create outside of classroom assignments. And I think that was really beneficial to where I am now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I was just talking for the last episode I did was with Kevin Tufts. He&#8217;s a product designer at Facebook. And we were sort of talking about kind of the time period that you were in school, like early two thousand and ten s and how it felt like design really took this abrupt shift into digital and product at a time when I think a lot of us prior to that were learning about more traditional design, like graphic design, visual design, web design. And then overnight that became product designer, UX designer. And you&#8217;re like, wait a minute, what? You thought you knew one thing and now your title is different and sometimes it&#8217;s the same skills, sometimes it&#8217;s not. Like, I can imagine. Certainly if you&#8217;re in school at that time, like, yeah, you get out and you thought you were learning one thing, and then you try to look for jobs and everything is different than what you thought it would be from what you learned. Yeah, I can certainly empathize with that. That whole time period was I&#8217;d. Say probably from 2006 to 2012. There were so many changes happening in design because of technology. Also, the browser was becoming more of a tool that you could use for design and less of just a presentation for a design. Right. Like, you could now do things in the browser and you have new tools coming out. I think this was around the time I want to say this was around the time, like Sketch or maybe like another web based tool really started to come about. I don&#8217;t know if Figma was around.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Back then, but yeah, I think Envision was one.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah, InVision. Yeah. So you had this kind of shift from the Adobe style of these extremely expensive, extremely complicated pieces of software because they started to go subscription based. And then in response to that, people are like, well, we&#8217;re just going to make something that you can do in the browser. I don&#8217;t know if Sketch was in the browser, but it was just such an interesting time because the tools were changing from what industry standards used to be to these new things. And again, the titles were also changing. I feel like when I look back at that, that was a very tumultuous time in design that it was hard to keep up with what was going on because innovation was happening so quickly.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Yeah, and graduating in the midst of that when you still are trying to learn this new thing, like four years, learning something that goes by really fast, and depending on your curriculum, depending on who your professors are and their skill set, their skill set could still be in a certain decade of design. And now they&#8217;re like, okay, everybody, let&#8217;s rush. I remember buying my first Adobe software when you had to buy the CDs and you couldn&#8217;t share the CD code or whatever the little access code was to now, like subscription. I remember how much of a big deal that was and just the shift that was coming. It was really tough. By the time I got to MICA, it kind of advanced, too. And so I was with a whole new cohort of people that were ready to create design in this new way. And so I feel like Salisbury was really an exploration of what design is like, a really rough exploration of, okay, these are these different tools. This is layout. But MICA really set the foundation and kind of solidified it for me. Yeah, that 2010 period. Now, even now, we have content creation now, which also shifts the media in which we&#8217;re designing for. And so, I mean, Apple is going to come out. They just dropped their latest thing, and that&#8217;s going to shift the medium in which we&#8217;re creating and the scale and the size and the resolution, all of that matters when you&#8217;re thinking about and understanding the tools that you have now.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
During that time that you were like you said, you&#8217;re working in this beauty supply shop. You were working as an admin assistant. How were you feeling about doing that kind of work? Like you mentioned before, going to Salisbury, and you spend all this time studying for your craft, and then you get out and you&#8217;re not working in what you studied. How did that time make you feel?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
It was definitely an adjustment process. I think also dealing with I talk about this a lot amongst my friends and family, like post grad depression as an undergrad, when you go from being in this community of people and then you move away from that community of people, that&#8217;s such a shift. Like your friends. Like, I had a best friend, she lived in New York, so I didn&#8217;t get to see her unless we came to see each other. So that sense of community for me, shifting in who you are when you grow and you&#8217;re living on your own in a town or in college, that&#8217;s a completely different person from when you were living with your mom in high school. And so going back to that, there&#8217;s all these different changes. But I think I knew that what I was doing was just a placement of like I knew that my career was going to be bigger than what it currently was. So having that administrative assistant role, I used to always when computers first came out, my grandma, she had a computer, I would always play like, oh, I&#8217;m working at an office, or things like that. And I think it works for the logical I&#8217;m a Virgo, so really scheduling, organizing those things I love, I kind of thrive in. So it wasn&#8217;t a miserable place. It was also a great company to work for. Again, it was a small organization, but they had just a lot of different things to cultivate community there. And I was able to I was in that role for a year, and then I moved to their meetings department because I guess I was doing so well in assisting with the events that they did. It wasn&#8217;t miserable. I always knew even before graduating Salisbury, I was like, okay, I&#8217;m graduating. Here are my options. I could go back to school and go to grad school, and I kind of knew a little bit about Mica. And so by the time I had that full time administrative assistant position and then into meetings, I was like, okay, you&#8217;ve been here for I think it might have been year two. Now, what are we doing next? Because you can get complacent here or you can take that leap. Just like you took the leap from business administration, which felt comfortable, to going for design. I told myself, you didn&#8217;t take that leap just to give up or to just kind of settle for this current position. So I applied to go to MICA and I got accepted.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Tell me about what that was like. I&#8217;m pretty sure that was much different from Salisbury?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Yes, it was much different. First of all, I must say that my love for Baltimore, oh, my goodness, it&#8217;s such a beautiful place to be, a beautiful community to grow. Of course, part of my time was spent in what they call like the MICA bubble. So the bubble of the art community in school there, but during, just constantly inspired by other creatives. That was something that I loved and really propelled my understanding of what a creative practice looks like and how other people are creating. So it was beautiful. I did a post Baccular program, and then I did the MFA program. So when I first applied, I applied to both, but I was accepted into the post baccalaureate. That program was phenomenal. I grew so much. It was just one year, but I grew so much in that one year of my understanding for design. I think by that time, I was a much different person than when I first graduated. I had started to really focus on mindfulness practices, and I was being mindful of the soaps that I was using and the food that I was putting in my body, and also having this awakening of learning about African American and Black artists and designer. And so I learned about Emory Douglas there. He spoke at Bowie [State] University. And I got to meet him and just really teaching myself the history that I wanted to learn, because I was, again, very intentional about that. It&#8217;s like, okay, I have this skill set. I know what this is. I&#8217;ve looked through Meggs Book of Graphic Design history, and I don&#8217;t see any Black people, but I know we&#8217;re here. I know I&#8217;m not the first graphic designer, so let me do the work to teach myself. And I think a lot of us do that. We have to teach ourselves a lot of our own history. Thankfully, now things are very different. You could pull up TikTok and you have a whole video on designers, fashion designers, whatever you want to learn, you can learn. So, yeah, it was a beautiful time of exploration, being around other designers that had different backgrounds, like a lot of people had. They were science majors. Not everyone had a design background. And so we all brought different perspectives to what we were creating, and it was really good. The curriculum also was just it&#8217;s a night and day from my time at Salisbury and my time at MICA. Again, the design industry was very different at that time, too. I started MICA in 2017. So again, two different eras of design. I&#8217;m forever grateful for that experience. I&#8217;ve blossomed so much and added so many things like motion graphic to my skill set. I remember there was a workshop that we would have different workshops throughout the year. And we had a workshop on after Effects. And I was like, what is this? I thought I got away from math. What are all these numbers. What is this interface? I was completely intimidated. But by the time I started the MFA program, I took a motion graphics class because I realized these target commercials. This is motion graphics. This is how you can use design as a tool in a different medium. It doesn&#8217;t have to be traditional print or anything like that. So I wanted to learn how to do that. I wanted to add that to my toolkit and my skill set. I spent a lot of time that first year learning about publication design and these methods that I was drawn to that drew me to design in the first place. Salisbury, at the time that I was there, I don&#8217;t think that we learned a lot about the foundation of layout design. And so I was able to get that at MICA. So I spent a lot of that first year exploring that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I mean, it really sounds like MICA just kind of re energized you as a designer and kind of put you on the track that you needed to be on to get to where you&#8217;re at now.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Yeah, it definitely did. And also the amount of resources that they have. Their career development. Yeah, the career development department, they are super helpful. They help you find jobs, they help you cultivate your portfolio, build your portfolio. They have so many tools of here&#8217;s how to interview that they update and keep updated. And so having access to those resources as a student and as a graduate and an alumni, it&#8217;s so beneficial. We need those tools, especially, again, as Black designers, where we may not have representation or we may not see ourselves in certain industries. And I think we deserve mentors. We need mentors at every step of the journey. And so they were really a lifeline for a lot of those things of preparing for your portfolio, your resume. They have full templates that they update in different scenarios. And those things I didn&#8217;t receive from Salisbury at the time, from my program or the university. I can&#8217;t say that those things are whether they&#8217;ve improved or not, but yet having access to those various resources. Baltimore is also just a great community for artists. There&#8217;s so many different resources and grants. And I had exhibited my work at my first art exhibition. I never would have thought, like, oh, I can show my work here. I don&#8217;t have to create art. It doesn&#8217;t have to be on a canvas. I don&#8217;t have to pull out a paintbrush, but I can actually showcase my work. That was also the first time I ever sold artwork. So I was introduced to new forms of art and showcase my art in different ways. They have something called the Is. It the art market? Mica art market every year. And so this big thing around holiday season, the Illustrator department, they have this big set up so students can sell their artwork. There&#8217;s different vendors from the community as well as alumni. So I created and sold my first art print and stickers there. And so that was kind of the birth of the art shop that I have today. So, yeah, getting introduced to all of these different means of showcasing your design and your art, it was really a great time.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Yeah. Sounds like MICA was transformative in many ways for you.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Yeah, it definitely was.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You mentioned resources, and we sort of had this conversation a bit before we started recording, and I was like, let&#8217;s save it for the show. Another resource that is available to us as designers are design organizations. There&#8217;s AIGA. There&#8217;s the Graphic Artists Guild, IDSA, et cetera. What are your thoughts on sort of design organizations now? Because you&#8217;ve said before again, this is before we started recording, but AIGA DC, for example, was a big help for you.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Yeah. So in between kind of that shift before MICA and while working as an administrative assistant, the meetings, I was like, okay, I need to be around the people. Where are the designers? I will say give credit to Salisbury. One of my professors was like, you guys need to join this. You need to join AIGA. It&#8217;s only however the membership was, it&#8217;s only $5. You need to join. You need to join. And in my mind, I&#8217;m like, well, I don&#8217;t see Black people in this class. I don&#8217;t even know if I want to enter another space where I&#8217;m like, okay, here we go. That kind of thing also very much an introvert, so maybe my introvert self was like, speaking of, oh, no, I have to go talk to more people or join a group with other people. But that later came back because I listened to revision podcast. Thank you very much. Thank you. Because you guys definitely found me and helped me to just figure out where to go. And I think one episode you were talking about AIGA, and that is a resource. And so I was like, okay, let me look this up. And so I went to one of their events, and I think AIGA DC has been a great resource for me. I was able to apply for a scholarship while at Mica. They also have various events like DC Design Week. And so I was able to do a pop up shop with them, with my art shop. So I think depending on where you are, the different chapters might be a little different. But AIGA DC has definitely been an amazing resource for me to find my way, figure out what places I could work, what different career paths other people had and their journey, and just connecting with other designers. Also, more recently, I was a part of Designers Ignite, and so that was during COVID but it was an opportunity for designers to Black Designers Ignite. It was an opportunity for us to talk about our work, our progress, where we are, and for us to get paid for speaking. So that was an amazing resource. I think COVID and post COVID brought about a lot of different design organizations that I found that I could connect with versus before, it was just AIGA. DC, or AIGA in general, not even DC. And that felt a little bit more corporate for me at the time. Again, the design industry had a major shift early on. Some of the things and practices, they seemed a little, to me, outdated, a little closed off. But as time has progressed, I think AIGA has been a great resource also. It&#8217;s an online resource, but brand new website by under consideration. I think that&#8217;s the proper umbrella, but they&#8217;re a great resource for anything branding, branding, identity, visual identity. So different online resources and communities I&#8217;ve been able to connect with. So if I didn&#8217;t get it from one organization, then I was able to kind of navigate to some of these other organizations to find the resources and just to connect with the people that I felt that represented me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
For people that have listened to the show, I&#8217;ve kind of mentioned AIGA a lot over the years. I&#8217;ve volunteered for them, things of that nature. I really do wonder in general, about the role of design organizations for the modern designer. I remember this might have been, I guess, maybe about right before the pandemic. I know that there was a lot of talk with AIGA about them not really considering UX designers as designers, and I feel like I think the organization started to come around on that. But there have been a lot of topics recently regarding AI art and sort of the encroachment of technology into the creative space and what that means for creatives in general. And I&#8217;ve seen honestly, a lot of our modern design organizations have been kind of silent about it. I think I might have heard the most from the graphic artist guild. I know that they do some regular events, but, like, AIGA has been silent. I don&#8217;t know if IDSA has said anything or any other types of organizations. I would love to see our designer orgs in general, just be more proactive and talk about the things that are happening in the industry instead of just taking dues and maybe having a monthly webinar. And this is no shade to anyone in particular, but I would love to see them just be more in the community and proactive in that way, because it sort of feels like, especially with AIGA now, them I will single out. I remember when I was volunteering with them and there was this big push for us to get more Black students, really more HBCUs involved with student groups. And it&#8217;s like, yeah, but the parameters around a student group might not apply for HBCU, because for a student group, you have to, I think, be within 50 miles of a regular chapter. You have to have at least ten students that are studying design. And then I think a professor has to be or had to be, like, a sustaining member, like one of the top membership levels. If you did those three things, then you could have a student chapter. And I&#8217;m like, well, that might be prohibitive for an HBCU that&#8217;s like, not near a city or there&#8217;s not ten students in the program.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
There might be two, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Like, it&#8217;s prohibitive. And so we were trying to talk about getting them to sort of lessen that for HBCUs, and then they were like, well, if we do it for them, we have to do it for everybody. And I&#8217;m like, well, do it for everybody. But I mean, the reason that they didn&#8217;t want to do that is because it boils down to finance. If they know each student group is getting at least a minimum amount of money that goes back into the organization, all of that stuff, it&#8217;s all somewhat self sustaining in that way. So in that respect, I don&#8217;t know if our design orgs are equipped at the moment to really do that. I would love to just see more of that in general, because I don&#8217;t really see a lot of it now. I feel like they&#8217;re being pretty quiet and reactionary instead of really like, speaking up about how this affects our industry, how sort of these things affect our industry.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Yeah, I think we definitely because they hold this title of being a guild for graphic designers and artists, we also expect them to lead some of the different changes and to kind of push to the conversation, to push the changes to advocate for us, especially when it comes to AI. I would have thought with Photoshop releasing this new AI feature that&#8217;s going crazy, that they would connect, the two organizations would come together and say, okay, here&#8217;s what we have on this. Here&#8217;s what this tool is doing, here&#8217;s the information, or here&#8217;s the discussion that we can have around this. Maybe they are having it. And I don&#8217;t know, because, again, I&#8217;m not within these organizations, but we definitely want and we talked a lot about the shift that happened in design from 2010 to 2017 or even 2014. I think being in the midst of that and helping designers, maybe it&#8217;s a thing of understanding the core audience. A lot of young designers rely on them or may go to them to help them in these different moments of their career. And so if these practices and things are outdated, you&#8217;re going to lose those people that really do at the core need your assistance. Like, HBCUs should for sure be supported, especially given how eager a lot of the companies were to highlight Black stories and Black voices and oh, now we have all of these different initiatives to support HBCUs. Well, we want to see that applied across the board, and not just for a short period of time, because we already know that we&#8217;re dealing with so many barriers and checklist, stipulations, whatever when it comes to even getting hired for a job. Because let&#8217;s be real. Like, the hiring process and those practices are still very challenging. And so if our own organizations that are for us aren&#8217;t helping us get over that hump, aren&#8217;t leading the conversation, aren&#8217;t pushing and encouraging these companies and HR hiring practices to change and shift as design is changing and shifting, what&#8217;s really the purpose? What&#8217;s going on? I think COVID thankfully shook a lot of organizations and things and practices up. And I think companies need to be doing those checks and balances on a regular basis, not just every decade or natural disaster. We need to be doing these things on a regular basis and having these conversations so that your organization can sustain itself and the culture of design and where it&#8217;s headed. Yeah. AI. I don&#8217;t even want to talk about it. Don&#8217;t understand just the overall checks and balances. I have not used the Photoshop tool. I will use the Lasso and the pencil tool till I can&#8217;t no more before I begin swapping out backgrounds with different stuff, until I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t fully trust it right now. But just like with other things, we evolve and we grow. So I&#8217;ll look forward to the day that I actually test out that tool.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I haven&#8217;t downloaded I think it&#8217;s like a beta version of Photoshop that allows you to kind of it&#8217;s similar, I guess, to content aware fill, where it will automatically generate part of an image or something. I haven&#8217;t done that yet, but we&#8217;re certainly seeing AI filters being a big thing if you&#8217;re on TikTok, if you&#8217;re on Instagram. I mean, even augmented reality stuff, I guess, kind of maybe ties into this a little bit, like stuff that Snap has done with filters and lenses and stuff. But it would be good to hear from our design organizations. They&#8217;re just kind of thoughts about this, even if it&#8217;s like drawing a line in the sand or something. Because I know that it&#8217;s only going to be a matter of time where people who are not designers will generate AI art things and then try to take them to designers for edits or changes or something. And I feel like there needs to be an industry wide line in the sand that says, we are not doing this. Absolutely not. Like, it needs to be something that is across the board. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
In a way to protect your intellectual property as a designer. I think there was one app that everyone was using and it was putting together all these really cool pictures on Instagram. It&#8217;s like, okay, but where are these images being pulled from? It&#8217;s being pulled from the Internet. Somebody had to create bits and pieces and is now creating this beautiful picture of you. So I think the music industry has started to set some parameters around AI because they&#8217;re using Drake&#8217;s voice on a Kanye beat.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, yeah, I remember that.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Things like that are happening. So, yeah, we also, as designers, want to need to start having those conversations too, especially when it comes to our intellectual property and how our work can be protected and what our new design process will look like when we are working within AI generated art.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well said. Well said. What advice would you give to someone out there who&#8217;s kind of hearing your story and they want to kind of follow in your footsteps? What would you tell them first?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
I definitely say take the risk. I think through these different moments of my journey, it really resulted in me taking a risk. Like just going with it, going with what I wanted. Sometimes I would say, oh, no, let&#8217;s play safe and let&#8217;s try this. No, go for what you want if you want to, especially in the age that we are in now where you can directly reach people. I know people say this all the time, but it really does matter. Your moment can change from night and day just by you sharing your work, sharing your design process. It can be an ugly design process. It doesn&#8217;t have to be the final product. But sharing how you think through creatively different works and things like that can be the next step that you need to elevate and pivot your career and your dream career, or your dream creative journey. Not even just a career, but your dream creative practice. So I think definitely go for it. If there&#8217;s something that you want to do, if it&#8217;s something in your heart that you&#8217;re like, oh, I don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;re putting all these limitations, just do it. Just take the first step, because I promise you, everything else is going to fall in line. I would have never thought that by me switching my major and being in love with yearbook and magazines would now lead to where my career is now. Everything that I do is fulfilling it&#8217;s in alignment with who I am. So really just take that risk. And also knowing again what your values are and what kind of work you want to be creating, what type of clients you want to work with, and manifesting that. Speaking of into existence also, I think trusting that journey and process and being okay, that it can get a little messy. It can not be like, for me, I was out of work for a very long time when this just this past year, to the point where I was like, I don&#8217;t know, I was kind of burnt out a little bit from freelance. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing. I really don&#8217;t want to work full time, but just not really knowing what that next step was. But it&#8217;s working out for me. Things aligned. I got a job that I really loved. I love there&#8217;s so many different things that I prayed on and manifested on and just really started to be intentional about the things that I was asking for and not playing. Don&#8217;t play yourself small. You got to think big. You really do. Like, whatever you want to achieve in this lifetime, if it&#8217;s aligned, it&#8217;ll definitely work out. So just really take those steps. I think also asking not being too afraid to ask for help, sometimes I forget that, hey, it&#8217;s okay to go and reach out to this person. If you don&#8217;t know how to do this thing, like using that network and community that you have because you have it for a reason, whether it&#8217;s an old teacher or an old classmate, you just never know. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for that help, especially with someone who didn&#8217;t necessarily have mentors or someone consistently guiding me through this creative process. I&#8217;ve just been like, okay, I want to do this. Let me try it. Let&#8217;s see how it works. Like, I want to create an art shop. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen, what&#8217;s going to come of it. Well, now I&#8217;m in four stores and I&#8217;ve sold my artwork internationally. There&#8217;s so many different things of taking that leap, but also asking for help along that journey, like, don&#8217;t be afraid to do it. The worst that anybody can say is, no, can&#8217;t help you, or I don&#8217;t know the answer. That&#8217;s it, I think. Yeah, just really taking that leap. Also getting your creative practice in order in your creative process, I think that&#8217;s something that I didn&#8217;t realize until later on down the line, especially after being in Mica and the rigor that is grad school and being diagnosed with breast cancer. I think I was like, oh my gosh, did I work myself to the bone? What is going on? How was I not paying attention to my body during this time? And so really figuring out what creative practice works for you, what that looks like. Fletcher it&#8217;s taking a day off throughout the week to go explore, to go be in nature, to go on a road trip or a trip somewhere, if you can just invigorate your creativity, taking rest from working in general just so that you can take care of your well being and your health. The nature in which graphic design lives in, it&#8217;s a fast paced environment where people essentially want you to be robots of just working around the clock and churning out these designs. And not everybody can work in that type of creative environment. So really figuring out how you thrive creatively, what things work for you, whether it be your meal prepping to your intake of media and content, what things are really going to get you in a good space to create and inspire you. That&#8217;s something that I think is really important for us to have. We can be burnt out so quickly of just always consuming media, content, everything. And then we do that. Within our own practice. Sometimes you don&#8217;t need to research for 3 hours with design. Sometimes just give yourself ten minutes to find what you need and be intentional and then go and create. Go and sketch it out. Yeah, I think that it&#8217;s really important. Design School doesn&#8217;t teach you about the business of design. So if you want to be your own boss, if you want to dabble in different things, you might not get that from Design School. So you&#8217;re definitely going to have to teach yourself some of those practices. And so again, having a creative process in place that keeps you a little structured, having the schedule that, you know, okay, today I&#8217;m just going to do administrative task. I&#8217;m just going to dedicate this day to responding to emails and then you have the rest of the week to create. Coming up with that kind of structure I think really helps. I found myself during my freelance journey getting off the rails a little bit, like I was spending too much time at home. I was burnt out because I was working around the clock, then trying to find more work and trying to update my portfolio, all these things. So it really helps to have that structure a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow, that&#8217;s tremendous advice. I almost feel like we can sort of wrap it up here. I don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s anything I can say that can trump that, but I mean&#8230;just to wrap it up here, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work? Like, where can they follow you online?</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Yeah. So I&#8217;m online. If you want to follow me on social media, you can follow me on Instagram and TikTok and Twitter at @digitrillnana. It should be linked in the podcast. But that&#8217;s D-I-G-I-T-R-I-L-L-N-A-N-A. Think Foxy Brown &#8220;Ill Na Na&#8221; and digital design. That&#8217;s what that is. Okay, of course, online. My portfolio is ashley-fletcher.com, and then my art shop is digitrillnana.com. If you are in the DMV area, you can find me in local shops. I&#8217;m at the MICA Bookstore in Baltimore, Maryland. I&#8217;m also at Sankofa. You can find some of my art goods in Sankofa in DC on Georgia Avenue.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow. Ashley Fletcher, thank you so much for coming on the show. You don&#8217;t know this. You kind of inadvertently spoke a word into me with all that advice. That was some stuff I personally also needed to hear, and I hope that certainly the listeners will get that too. But your whole story of kind of persevering through not just kind of getting sidetracked in terms of your path to being a designer, but your perseverance and your creativity and your drive and your passion for this just completely shines through in everything that you&#8217;ve said. And I&#8217;m so excited to see where you go next in the future. It&#8217;s always exciting for me when I do this show and I talk to people that are so energetic and dynamic about the field of design and the work that they do, and I really feel like you&#8217;re an excellent representation for that. Keep shining, keep doing what you&#8217;re doing. And thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Ashley Fletcher:</b><br>
Thank you so much. You just spoke life into me, so I appreciate it if you are listening to this podcast. Keep going, guys. Like, we got this. I&#8217;m so grateful to just have this opportunity to connect and just share some wisdom in a space that once inspired me. So Maurice, thank you so much for all that you do. Yeah, thank you.</p>

<p>Kevin Tufts is the real deal when it comes to tech and design. With over two decades of experience working across a number of companies in the Bay Area &#8212; Lyft, SendGrid, and Twilio, to name a few &#8212; he&#8217;s now a product designer at Meta working on their Creation team. So believe me, we had a LOT to talk about.</p>
<p>Our conversation begin with a look at the current climate inside Meta (pre-Threads, FYI), and he gave some thoughts on where the company is going as it approaches its 20th anniversary. From there, Kevin talked about his path to becoming a product designer, and we took a trip down memory lane recalling the early days of web design and what it was like working during such rapidly changing times. He also spoke on what he loves about product design now, and how he wants to help the next generation of designers through mentorship. </p>
<p>Kevin&#8217;s secrets to success are simple: seize opportunities for growth where you can, embrace collaboration, and remain flexible. Now that&#8217;s something I think we could all take to heart!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
I am Kevin Tufts. I am a product designer currently working at Facebook, and I live in San Jose, California.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has this year been treating you so far?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
I&#8217;d say personally the year has been pretty good. I am grateful to be employed and obviously you&#8217;ve seen in the media that Meta has had several waves of layoffs, unfortunately. So all things considered, I feel pretty grateful. Feel pretty good, but a little anxious. I&#8217;m human, so it&#8217;s definitely some wild times not just within Meta, but the tech ecosystem as a whole.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Do you have any plans for the summer?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Plans for the summer are going to be pretty chill. So one of my side hobbies is I&#8217;m an avid cyclist, so I&#8217;ve been doing bike events from beginning of April up until just a couple of weeks ago. So this summer I think I&#8217;m just going to chill, stay local and got some family stuff happening. I got some folks coming into town, so should be hopefully a quiet summer.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. That&#8217;s good. Is there anything in particular that you want to try to accomplish this year, like for the rest of the year?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, there&#8217;s some kind of like more career-oriented things that I want to sharpen up on and that&#8217;s with mentorship and maybe doing more design oriented workshops where I&#8217;m teaching kids from different backgrounds but mostly from people of color how to use design tools and how to get into product design as a whole.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I think that&#8217;s a really good thing, especially now when I&#8217;d say I feel like over the past two or three years we&#8217;ve started to see a lot of the younger generation, like Gen Z and younger are starting to look at tech more as a viable opportunity for them to go into for their career. So that&#8217;s a good thing. I hope you get a chance to do that.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, looking forward to there&#8217;s a couple of avenues and programs that I&#8217;ve been working with here in the Bay Area that&#8217;s been awesome. So yeah, there&#8217;s some big things on the horizon for me personally.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Talk to me about the work that you&#8217;re doing at Facebook. Like, are you working on a specific product there?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, mostly working within what&#8217;s called Creation, and that&#8217;s the organization that handles a lot of our creation tools like Reels and Stories. And so for me, a lot of my work swirls around Stories, so I get to touch everything from the gallery to the Stories composer, just the experience itself, which has been pretty cool. And then I also work across Facebook, Lite, iOS and Android. And I call that out because most people that are listening, that are here within the US. May not be aware that we have such an app called Facebook Lite, but it&#8217;s a stripped-down version of the app that runs on Android and it&#8217;s a popular app in kind of like more developing nations.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So like if you&#8217;re using, say, like, I know there&#8217;s this terminology of a dumb phone as opposed to like a smartphone, but like a phone that&#8217;s not maybe always connected to the Internet.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
You got it. Yeah, you nailed it. So there&#8217;s different flavors of that where you can go into low data mode, and then you&#8217;ll see almost just a very plain Jane. Just a few images and some text, just a stripped down version of the core app.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What does your team look like that you work with?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Team is pretty big, so within the organization there are different pillars that handle different aspects of the experience. I&#8217;m on the Creation Growth team, so we run tons of design experiments. It&#8217;s a really fast moving, fast paced.org, can be challenging, but really fun because you get to try all types of different unique design directions that you wouldn&#8217;t necessarily try in other product spaces around Meta. And we have quite a number of designers as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, what does a regular day kind of look like for you? Are you working remotely? Are you back in the office now? What does that look like?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, I&#8217;m working remotely, and just recently, like most companies in the Bay, we have a new return to office policy. So a lot of us will be continuing to work remotely. And some of us that live here in the Bay are going to be going in three days a week.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So you would have to be going into the Menlo Park office then?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, that&#8217;s my closest office.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;m trying to place the Bay geography. How far away is that from where you&#8217;re at in San Jose?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, it&#8217;s about a 20 minute drive. 25 minutes? I mean, it takes a while because of traffic.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Okay, that&#8217;s not that bad. That&#8217;s not that bad at all. Yeah. The last time I was in San Francisco was in God. Oh, that was 2016, actually was 2016. I spoke at Facebook, and I remember it took&#8230;oh, wow. I think it took an hour to get from San Francisco to Menlo Park. And I was thinking, &#8220;people make this commute every day. This is a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
That sounds great compared to doing like an hour and a half or two hours if there&#8217;s an accident.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I want to approach this part of the conversation rather gingerly. I feel like there&#8217;s a third rail that I really don&#8217;t want to touch with regards to Facebook. But what&#8217;s the mood like there right now? I mean, as you mentioned, they&#8217;ve been in the news recently because of conversations around the metaverse. The Meta Quest 3 just dropped fairly recently, and then right after that, Apple dropped their AR headset. Yeah. What&#8217;s the mood like at Facebook overall?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
I think because of the frequency of the layoffs, you know, we went into the end of last year with the first big wave, and then we just had the two more recent ones. People, they seem to be resilient, but a lot of us are kind of reserved and really just a little numb because all this stuff has been in such close succession, right. So ultimately everyone is just kind of moving forward and performing their duties as they always would. I think a lot of us are just trying to like, ride this out because we know that it&#8217;s going to be challenging for at least quite a few number of months before the dust truly settles. After every large layoff at any company, then there&#8217;s always the trimmers that you experience, right, because you&#8217;ll have a series of reorgs, so then you have to ride those waves. So that&#8217;s kind of where we are right now. But for the most part, everyone is pushing forward and we&#8217;re now into roadmap planning season. So it&#8217;s like our minds are occupied with just trying to plan for the next half.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it can be a very odd place to still work somewhere after a layoff. Sometimes you have I guess the best way to call this, or the best thing to call it, would be survivor&#8217;s guilt that you&#8217;re here when maybe a team member has left or someone else you knew at the company has left. And then especially when these kinds of things happen in succession like that, it can almost kind of feel a bit like you&#8217;re walking on eggshells, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, in some regards it&#8217;s exactly like that because this is also impacting our performance reviews, right. So a lot of us engineers as well, you&#8217;ve been working on a project or maybe you&#8217;ve been reordered. So now the work that you had going on, you had to drop it midstream to go pick up something else from someone else&#8217;s team. And yeah, it&#8217;s chaotic and so there&#8217;s the stress of like, hey, how is my performance review going to look? That&#8217;s just kind of like where we are. It&#8217;s like you can only worry about what you can control. And I guess we&#8217;ll cross that bridge when we all get there.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now for those of us who have been online for a very long time, when I say that at least 20 years or so, we remember when Facebook launched. Facebook launched in the early 2000s, like 2003, 2004&#8230;I think right around that time. And we&#8217;re now about to come up on Facebook&#8217;s 20th anniversary, which is wild to think of for an Internet company. What do you think, like Facebook&#8217;s place is now in this kind of modern internet era that we&#8217;re in?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Well, obviously we&#8217;ve tried to well, I shouldn&#8217;t say try, but we&#8217;ve entered the VR space, so I don&#8217;t see that going away anytime soon. But I think what we&#8217;ll start to head is maybe putting more development and focus into AI things as everybody is sort of racing to get there wherever there is. So we may have more of a shift towards AI oriented experiences and less attention on the metaverse and then obviously just kind of moving forward with the ultimate goal of just having a totally connected planet. Right. And what I noticed between the US. And just working on things that will be tested in other countries is that here in the US. The way the media spins things is that Facebook&#8217;s dying. And it&#8217;s really just kind of how the media frames things. But it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s like the popularity of the app hasn&#8217;t really dipped and it&#8217;s actually increasing outside of the U.S. market. And then within the U.S. market, there&#8217;s quite a number of unique things that I think we&#8217;re going to be able to latch onto and really just kind of like shock the general public.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Sort of reminds me of that saying about the reports of my death are greatly exaggerated or something like that. I think Mark Twain said that probably. I mean, with a company as big as Facebook that has a global reach like that. I get what you&#8217;re saying about the media, like tech media here or even the more mainstream outlets here will make it seem like, oh, Facebook is this big dying site. But Facebook is still the number one website in the world. And the world is a big place. It&#8217;s not just the U.S. I mean the U.S. media scene, the U.S. tech scene, et cetera. Facebook has not only just Facebook the social network, but Instagram and WhatsApp. And there&#8217;s other apps and things that are out there in the world that are heavily used. So to say that Facebook is dying feels kind of premature just because it has a reach that eclipses so many other products, so many other companies. It&#8217;s a lot bigger, I think, than we might think that it is based on what the media might say it is.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
And we don&#8217;t think about a lot of the other sub-products. Right. We have Groups, which is the communities based product within the app. It&#8217;s extremely popular messenger. We&#8217;ve got our foot in so many different pools right now that it&#8217;s really just kind of like the media, the U.S. focused media that&#8217;s always basically picking on the company.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. And I mean, folks that have listened to this show for any period of time know I am not a Facebook fan. I&#8217;m not going to say I&#8217;m a Facebook hater, but you can&#8217;t knock the fact that Facebook has&#8230;it&#8217;s got its reach in a lot of different places across a lot of different products. And so just the social network itself is not the entirety of what Facebook is about.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
And I never thought that I would be working here. And now that I&#8217;ve been here almost three years, I could definitely see both sides of the coin, especially in terms of how the media positions things, but also rightfully so. We have a huge trust deficit that we&#8217;re continuing to try to improve. But it&#8217;s a hard mountain to climb, especially after the ways of layoffs that we&#8217;ve just seen. And some of the initiatives that the integrity teams have been cut. It&#8217;s tough, it takes time, and unfortunately things move faster than we can react to.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And some of those things are not even in Facebook&#8217;s control. Like the things that happen with workforce reduction and things, a ton of tech companies are doing that because they&#8217;re looking at the economy and seeing is the country going into a recession? So they&#8217;re trying to sort of react and pivot to what might happen. Like they&#8217;re trying to forecast the future here. So I think the longer a tech company and I&#8217;d say this is any company, not just tech companies, I think tech companies are specific in this case because they span so many different industries outside of just like software development or whatever. But the longer a tech company sticks around and almost feels like the more issues people will find with it one way or another, the companies are going to mess up. They&#8217;re going to inadvertently say something or inadvertently do something or maybe purposely say something or do something. Like the longer a tech company sticks around, it feels like&#8230;I&#8217;m a Math guy, so if I think of the duration of a tech company as like the limit of a function, it&#8217;s like as the limit approaches zero, or wherever the end of the company is, so to speak, things are going to happen. Things are just going to happen because social media influences culture and that influences technology. And so what might have been good five years ago is no longer good now. And if there&#8217;s one thing that&#8217;s going to be constant, it&#8217;s change. And I think when a tech company sticks around long enough, unfortunately they&#8217;re going to possibly come up on the short end of the stick when it relates to that.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay, enough pontificating on my part.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Love it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s turn this back on you. Let&#8217;s learn more about you and about your journey as a designer in tech. I want to really take this back to the beginning here. So talk to me about where you grew up.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
So I was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the town and city known for LeBron James and it&#8217;s river catching on fire in the 1970s and terrible sports. Right. So that&#8217;s where I was born and right around the time I turned like eight or nine is when I moved to Southern California. So I have a big group of large group of family in Ohio, and then I have a family based in Southern California between the L.A. and Orange County area.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Were you exposed to a lot of design and technology growing up?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, so I was fortunate growing up that my dad, he was a computer guy, so I had a computer in the house growing up, which is completely rare, especially for the 1980s. So my dad, coming out of Vietnam, he was in a program that taught him how to work on mainframes. So when he got out of the military, he ended up landing a job in downtown Cleveland at one of the it&#8217;s really just kind of like a storage company, I guess you would say. I remember going to work with him and one computer took up the entire room and there&#8217;s these big reels and tapes. Yeah, I&#8217;ve always been exposed to tech stuff. And he was also like a big science fiction guy. And between having a computer in the house and then playing games at the arcade at the mall and just really watching science fiction flicks with him, there&#8217;s no surprise that I ended up doing what I&#8217;m doing today as for a career. </p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now you went to Cleveland State University where you majored in design. I&#8217;m curious, before that, did you know that design was something that you really wanted to study?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah. So by the time I went to Cleveland State and it was a total fluke because I moved to Ohio for other reasons. And while I was there, it looked like I was going to stay for a few years. I just come from Southern California and went to Ohio and got myself enrolled in university because I wanted to make sure I didn&#8217;t have any huge lapse in time to get my education out of the way. By that time, I had already been doing freelance things. Like, I was pretty much thinking I was going to be a print designer around that time. So the late 90s, probably around like &#8217;96, &#8217;97 is when I had thought, &#8220;okay, yeah, I&#8217;ll get into graphic design.&#8221; At the time, I didn&#8217;t even know it was called graphic design, but I was always the kid at high school doing the hip-hop flyers, a lot of flyers for open mics raves. So it was like the starter. The inkling of me being coming to designer was back in those days doing like bootleg flyers.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, those early print days back then were something else. Just the amount of creativity that you had, even though the medium itself was sort of fairly limited, I mean, that was a lot of fun.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah. Do something like really weird on the computer and then print it out. And then I would take some markers and then do something on top of that so it&#8217;d be like this multimedia flyer thing. Cut stuff out, paste it on and then xerox it again like at Kinkos. All that kind of stuff. Using QuarkXpress.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, man. QuarkXpress. I just had someone on recently and we were sort of talking about those early days with like PageMaker and Quark and trying to figure all that stuff out because I remember Quark specifically because I used that along with PageMaker to design my high school newspaper. And the instruction manual that it came with could choke a horse. That thing was huge.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
And you had no one to read that stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nobody was reading through all that. This is way before online documentation. I mean, this thing came with a brick of an instruction manual that you had to go through. And I&#8217;m like, I have to know all of this just to use the software. It almost didn&#8217;t feel like it was worth it.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Right. Oh, wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, while you were in college, you were also a working designer too, is that right?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah. So I went to college, I was probably in my mid 20s, so basically I thought I had the world figured out because after high school, I didn&#8217;t go straight away to college. And that&#8217;s when a lot of my high school friends and people around me were just getting hired out of high school to just do HTML and build some wacky website. So I followed that path. And then when the.com bubble burst, it was a hefty smack in the face of reality. So that&#8217;s kind of like, what got me into Cleveland State. But by that time, yeah, I was working for E-Business Express, which is a web hosting company. So I was very fortunate. I was already kind of knowing my destiny, what I needed to do, where I wanted to go. And then I was also, like, in practice where other students in the class were just kind of like, figuring out what Illustrator is or Photoshop.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
E-Business Express is like a quintessential 90s online business.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Exactly. What kind of stuff were you doing there?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
I started off as a Linux server admin, so I wasn&#8217;t even doing, like, design stuff. But what I was doing that was valuable was because it&#8217;s a web hosting company is now I understand how things work behind the scenes, like how websites function. So I had that foundation of, like, I guess you would say webmaster at that time. That&#8217;s what it was considered. But yeah, just understanding how DNS works for www, your web domain, registering names, taking servers offline, like, really heady stuff. But I enjoyed it. It fulfilled, like, a side of me that I really like to tinker and explore things, and just being a Linux admin that it did it for me. But then it also gave me access to kind of like host my own little microsites and really just enable certain things on the server that people just don&#8217;t have access to. Right. Or if you&#8217;re designing a website, you&#8217;re certainly not thinking about uploading things on the command line and just really kind of Star Trek stuff at that time. That&#8217;s how I treated it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Well, I mean, also the thing back then is a lot of that stuff around web hosting was very opaque. Like, you almost had to be a command line or a terminal coder to know how to really get around, because the graphical user interface, or the GUI, I guess what we called it back then, like, the GUIs, were just not super user-friendly to that point. So you did have to know maybe how to telnet or how to or use a Linux command in order to change the permissions on a directory. Like you couldn&#8217;t just click a button or something to make that happen.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
That is a great point. Yeah, in the early days it wasn&#8217;t for everyone. You definitely had to have some technical prowess in order to upload a file or to get your web address, like get it all working, pull up a page.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I remember I was in high school in like the late 90s, and I remember even doing FTP stuff and being told at the time&#8230;I think maybe one of my teachers that told me was like, &#8220;oh, so you&#8217;re hacking, you&#8217;re a hacker now.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, it&#8217;s not hacking, it&#8217;s just FTP. But because they don&#8217;t see any graphics, all they see is just code. Because you know, this was like right before The Matrix or right, Matrix came out in &#8217;99. I remember because I was a freshman in college, it came out in &#8217;99 and yeah, all that stuff about FTP and oh my God. </p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, it was crazy, right? It&#8217;s like the only context the common man had was like some science fiction movie and then you think about it&#8230;it&#8217;s really like quite simple stuff.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, in hindsight, when you look back at it, it definitely is simple stuff. But yeah, during that time, just knowing how to do some of that sort of stuff, like people thought you were like a magician or something. You can make a website, you can put a picture of yourself online. How do you do that? And even what does online mean? Because the concept of being online in the 90s, like mid to late 90s, is such a different thing than now because social media didn&#8217;t exist. So for you, do you remember what that time was like for you?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, it was a whole new world and it felt like there wasn&#8217;t much online to look at. But I do remember like in the early days you had to work hard to make friends. So forums were real big, the IRC channels, so forums and chats, so AIM or Instant Messenger, Yahoo Chat. I remember all those different worlds and rooms and just whatever your interest was, you would just go out into that forum or chat, find your folks and then it was just kind of like not even instant replies, especially in the forum. You go in there, you chatted up, and then maybe 24 hours later you got a response. A lot of that stuff was amazing. I remember downloading my first video and it was a clip of a race car. It was like a drag strip. It was a 30 second clip. And I think it took like an hour and a half, maybe even two hours for that 30 second clip to download so that I could watch it over my 56K or whatever the modem was at the time. But yeah, it was just such a cool adventure and tinkering around with HTML and doing all the corny stuff like making the animated tickers. It was the Wild, Wild West, and I loved every bit of it. But it definitely took some patience. And you had to work hard for anything that you wanted to do on the Net.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Going back to E-Business Express for a minute, I mean, you worked there for almost eight years. When you look back at that time, what do you remember the most?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
I remember that it really helped me understand how the web functions and everything that&#8217;s needed for standing up a business. Because E-Business Express also specialized in helping medium, like small to medium sized businesses get set up online to sell. So it also gave me experience working within the realm of e-commerce. And then while working there, I worked there for eight years. And part of that was because the first few years I spent doing Linux admin stuff before I moved into becoming a full-blown just web designer for the company. So I&#8217;d switch roles, and the back end of my tenure there is what gave me experience with design, working with clients. So working more in, like, an agency style format is where I cut my teeth, as I guess you&#8217;d say, a traditional Web designer before moving into product.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, let&#8217;s talk about that shift. After E-Business Express, you&#8217;ve kind of started your career as a product designer at DotNetNuke, which now is known as DNN. How can I explain DotNetNuke? It&#8217;s a content management system. I have minimal experience with it. I worked with it briefly at WebMD and just thinking, like, how could someone make software so convoluted and confusing?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Well summarized.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Tell me about your time there.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, so the company is very unique because, as you said to CMS, and we had a lot of big government contracts, and there&#8217;s some educational institutions as well. And it was I&#8217;m trying to think of how to compare it maybe like a behemoth compared to WordPress. WordPress was really easy to get up and running. But there is a large community for Net Newt and primarily ran on Windows. So then you&#8217;ve got the IIS crowd of folks that are into it. So you got the engineer side, a lot of developers that supported the community. And then you also have the support side because there&#8217;s a lot of folks that were spinning up businesses around, like installations and helping you get up and running. On DNN, we also had those services as well. And then for me, it was awesome because it was my first foray into product thinking and product design. So when I worked at the company, we had, I think, three designers. Two of them were in marketing, I believe. And it&#8217;s just one product design person that did everything. It was like the jacket of all trades, but it. Was really cool. This is the first time getting experience with a design system where at that time we had a sticker sheet. So working in that capacity and then also working on product features. So where I&#8217;ve kind of come from more or less building websites that are catering to businesses to sell online now I&#8217;ve moved into kind of like more enterprise software. And a lot of the nuances of working within these product spaces and different product features and how to plan accordingly and doing a light amount of user research to the community, things like that. So kind of like an entry level crash course into product design.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now. Was it a big shift from E-Business Express? I mean, you&#8217;re going from this web hosting environment where you said you were in the back half of your time there doing design to now focusing on product, which I feel like during that time, if we&#8217;re talking like, the early 2010s, product was still kind of a new ish sort of term in a way. Did you know what a product designer was when you started there?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
No, because I think around that time also, we were still seeing on job listings, UI/UX. We were seeing like a myriad of job titles that meant the same thing, like visual designer or UI/UX and product designer. So when I moved out to the Bay Area, I had to kind of wrap my head around like, okay, I&#8217;m seeing these titles, but the job description is just a product design role interaction designer even. And then the description would be nothing more than just, like, a product design role. So, yeah, it took a while to kind of figure out what the companies were looking for. And then also, what did that mean? Like, what are the job functions that are necessary for me to be successful?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, there was definitely a shift in the industry right around that time where web designers, graphic designers, visual designers just suddenly started becoming product designer, UX designer. And, I mean, that&#8217;s something even I&#8217;ve encountered now. Like, if I tell people I&#8217;m a designer, I feel like nine times out of ten, they&#8217;re going to think that means a UX designer. And I&#8217;m like, oh, actually, I haven&#8217;t done UX design. Maybe not in the way that they&#8217;re thinking it, but I feel like that shift just kind of happened. Was that something that you noticed also?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, I did notice. It naturally sorted itself out because prior to that, I guess in our era, we kind of came up around the time where you&#8217;re expected to know all these different things. You had to be a visual designer. Also, Flash was pretty big too, so it&#8217;s like you had to know Flash and then programming languages, right? There are all these things. And I was also a front end developer at E-Business Express, so I did a lot of the integration work as well. And when I came to the Bay Area. I still had that mindset that I had to be a jack of [all] trades and know all these things. And then I was noticing that there are actually specialized roles now. Like, no longer are we living in a day and age where they&#8217;re expecting you to be a webmaster. Like, I hated that term and seeing that, it&#8217;s like you have to know Java. JavaScript, there was all these back end languages that were on our job description roles. When you just want to use Photoshop.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. When I worked at AT&#038;T as a designer, I think my title was just web designer. But we were doing web design, we were doing graphic design, we were doing front end design because we had to, of course, actually build the whole thing from scratch. And this was at the time when layout switched from tables to CSS. So you had to learn that with all the different cross browser compatibility, especially with IE6. And yeah, we had to know like, a little bit of Flash. Actually we used&#8230;oh my God, do you remember Swish? Yeah, Swish was like &#8220;Flash Lite&#8221;, I guess. It wasn&#8217;t made by Macromedia, which Adobe ended up buying, but it was a totally different company called Swish, and it was a more, I guess, sort of user-friendly interface to make Flash animation. But we had to know Flash. We had to know a little bit of Java, and I mean, like actual Java, not JavaScript. Ironically, we didn&#8217;t have to know JavaScript, but we had to know Java because we would do these web audio applet things and so we had to know how to troubleshoot the applet. So this is one position, graphic design, web design, Flash, Java, and you&#8217;re also sometimes doing some debugging of other people&#8217;s stuff. It was a lot into one particular title, and I feel like now that&#8217;s five different jobs at a company. After your time at DotNetNuke, you worked for a lot of other companies out in the Bay Area. You worked for &#8212; I&#8217;m listing off here &#8212; Workday, eBay, SendGrid, Twilio. And before Facebook, you were at Lyft for a short period of time. When you look back at those positions collectively, like, what stands out to you? Do you remember any particular things?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, I remember at DNN had an amazing time there and I felt like that was the kickstarter to my official tech career in the Bay and just getting my feet wet with engineering teams because we had a team of roughly like 100 engineers or so. And so that was the first time going from like a small web shop where there&#8217;s three developers and they&#8217;re within arm&#8217;s reach, to now I&#8217;ve got to talk to engineering leads and have these presentation reviews. So that was kind of like the world that I was living in at DNN. </p>
<p>And then when I moved over to Workday, that was my experience into the world of enterprise software and really how to work within the confines of a design system. Coincidentally enough, I worked on the internal tools team, so that was really unique to be on the team that has to essentially vet and take in requests from other product areas, different components that may need to be built or reviewed to see if there&#8217;s any efficacy to having engine spin up resources to bring to life. And then also working across different time zones. So Workday was amazing. And having to work with engineering teams in Ireland, and I&#8217;ve also got a couple of trips to Europe out of that as well. So can&#8217;t complain with that. The design culture at Workday at the time was growing, so design hadn&#8217;t been around at Workday for too long before I got there. I think maybe like a couple of years at the most. So we had a young but super talented design team that was working at Workday at that time, research, I want to call that out as well. So we did have a few research partners that were at Workday. So that was my first time interacting with research, other than me standing up some guerrilla survey or just doing kind of like personal research. My own living from Workday.</p>
<p>So I left Workday and went to eBay. And eBay was awesome because I met some incredible people and I&#8217;m still friends with a lot of them to this day. eBay was just a special time in my career where I was able to again, work at a massive company, work on different product spaces. And also, I&#8217;m an avid eBay user, so I came in with some personal knowledge of how the product works because some people that work at eBay, they don&#8217;t necessarily use the product. I&#8217;d say the same thing is probably like for a meta as well, right? Which probably is problematic. But I actually used the thing that I worked on, so that was really cool. Several opportunities to travel throughout Europe, mostly Germany, and eBay was close to home, so I didn&#8217;t have that long commute, like a lot of folks in the Bay Area. So that fulfilled my mood, was incredible back then. </p>
<p>And then transitioning from eBay, this is where things get interesting. So I ended up at a company called SendGrid. And SendGrid is kind of like an API communications company, more around the email marketing space. Really powerful tool. A lot of companies use it today. It&#8217;s kind of like the rival to Mailchimp for anyone that&#8217;s not familiar with SendGrid. So if you know Mailchimp, that&#8217;s basically what SendGrid is. And SendGrid was acquired by a company called Twilio. So that&#8217;s how I ended up at Twilio &#8212; through an acquisition. </p>
<p>When the acquisition took place, SendGrid had a very mature, young, but mature design organization, and Twilio was engineering centric, so they really did not have design. And I think literally there may have been like four designers, four product designers there at the time of the acquisition. Funny story. I&#8217;d actually interviewed with Twilio before the acquisition, maybe like a half a year prior to that, and got an offer. Decided that wasn&#8217;t quite where I wanted to be in my career because I wanted to go somewhere that had a mature design organization and I didn&#8217;t want to go somewhere where it&#8217;s just you kind of have to fight for your seat at the table. So I&#8217;ve seen some things at that time during the interview process that the folks were incredible, they were great, but I&#8217;m like, maybe I&#8217;ll pass. So I ended up going to SendGrid and I kid you not, on my first day, my first day in the office with my team and our first team meeting, we got an announcement to basically shut our laptops and we need to receive some news. And the news was that we had been acquired by Twilio. So the company I ran from was the company that ended up acquiring. They got me anyway, so I was the most expensive hire ever.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah. So to wrap things up, Twilio was just an interesting time. PDs were basically working across like anywhere from 4:00-9:00 p.m. At a time. I think I had eight that I was reporting to. So it was pretty chaotic, but at least you were shipping work like, daily. We didn&#8217;t have enough design resources. And also it was challenging because I mentioned that Syngra had a mature design culture and organization. So when we came in with a lot of our process oriented things and checkpoints with design briefs, which is necessary, especially in large, fast moving companies, we were trying to get the company to slow down so that we can improve the quality versus just kind of like PM coming up with an idea and ends just building it. And if it doesn&#8217;t work, oh well. We wanted to kind of move away from that mantra and more towards being design led. So tiny bit of friction around there, but ultimately they&#8217;re getting to where they need to be. And Lyft, I know I&#8217;ve done such a tour of duty here in the Bay Area.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I was going to say.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Finally &#8212; it&#8217;s going to stop now. But Lyft, I would say Lyft was a cherry on top for my career. It fulfilled so many things that I had been looking for, where I want to move fast, ship quality work, have a mature design organization, and a mature design system. Right? You don&#8217;t ever have to worry about what&#8217;s real, what&#8217;s not real, what&#8217;s in flight. Our design systems team at Lyft, product teams, everyone was just incredible to work with. And so I worked on the community safety team. My short stint at Lyft and the team that I worked on was unique because we got to wedge ourselves in between different product spaces without actually being a full-fledged member of the team. So I got to work on the Driver app and the Rider app. And then there&#8217;s some kind of like, unique things around the rental car space, which is Fleet, so there&#8217;s a lot of interesting work. And because it wasn&#8217;t a massive company, you could move fast. There was a researcher embedded on my team, so it was almost like bi-weekly we were testing things, and I just loved it. So I didn&#8217;t have to worry about the design system. Inevitably, when you&#8217;re working on the thing, sometimes you&#8217;re not working with a system that&#8217;s flexible enough to adhere to your needs and what you&#8217;re trying to solve. But while working with Lyft, I didn&#8217;t have to worry about all that. I just worried about the experience itself and everything else just fell into place. </p>
<p>But the pandemic is what got me to Meta. So when the pandemic hit and no one was going anywhere, no one&#8217;s driving, no one&#8217;s riding, I&#8217;m watching my colleagues, like almost weekly, like different goodbye emails that are going out. And it was a wild place to be in the year that everything seemed to have melted down. So out of self-preservation, and a need for not legit thinking the company was going to go over, I ended up making the jump over to Meta. </p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll stop there. And that&#8217;s the whole transition to where I am today.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, like you said, that is quite a tour of duty. One question I think that really stands out among all of that is, like, how have you seen product design change over the years? I imagine from company to company, it&#8217;s probably fairly similar because you&#8217;re working on software products. I guess you could say Lyft is software, but it&#8217;s transportation as well. But how have you seen product design change over the years since you first started?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
The tooling. I would definitely say, in terms of ease of collaboration, that is one of the biggest things that I&#8217;ve seen change. And then the tooling itself. So now that we&#8217;ve got these robust prototyping tools, it&#8217;s so much easier to demonstrate the design and the experience that you&#8217;re working on without having to know some hardcore programming languages. Like, back in the day, it was like you had to know JavaScript or jQuery just to maybe animate a dropdown, right? Or you may have had some ideas around something fancy that you wanted to do, maybe you wanted to have a side drawer appear on a website. But in order to do those things, you had to know a programming language or just mock it up in After Effects, which is also tedious. So I would say just the sheer volume of tools in the collaboration space and prototyping is just incredible.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s another podcast that I produce &#8212; I&#8217;m not going to mention the name of it &#8212; but there&#8217;s another show that I produce, and one of the things that we have been exploring through that that I feel like is also relevant to our conversation is like, just how much the browser has become a tool in and of itself. Like, the browser used to just be about presentation. You made a website or something like that, you put it online, whatever. But now, as the browsers have gotten savvier, as different frameworks have been created and such, the browser itself is such a tool to the point where there are services now that only exist in a browser. They don&#8217;t exist as standalone software, like an executable file or something like that. Like Figma, you can do full fledged graphic design all within your browser. And like, ten years ago, that would have almost been unheard of.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
It is mind blowing to do that in a browser. Like, through Figma, you&#8217;ve got these other tools like Webflow, and trying to think of some other ones that are out there canva I mean, it&#8217;s just totally jealous of the new designers, by the way. Every time these tools come out and I have to interact with them, and I&#8217;m just like, wow, I really couldn&#8217;t use this back in the day when I had maybe 100 buttons that I need to make a change on it. I had to go touch every hundred, you know, component.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Listen&#8230;modern designers will never know the pain of cross-browser compatibility. They will never understand how much of a pain in the ass it was to try to get one design to look the same across different versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox and Opera. Oh, my God.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Safari. Safari behavioral things. Yeah. [Internet Explorer] 6 through 8 were probably like the nightmares. Six and seven, for sure.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, for a while. I know. There was, like, a whole cottage industry around basically browser emulators. Because if you were on Windows, of course you couldn&#8217;t really use Safari. You&#8217;d have to use I mean, the Windows version of Safari you could use, but it didn&#8217;t even render the same between Windows and Mac. And so you had this software that you&#8217;d use that could hopefully reliably look the same between everywhere, and you had these little HTML shivs you had to do to make certain properties work. It was man, it was a jungle out there. It&#8217;s only like ten or so years ago. It was wild. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Not that long ago, when I was at E-Business Express, we bought a dedicated iMac for that very reason, so that we could run all the browsers on the Mac to see how they were responding as well. It&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t miss those days, but I am so grateful that I got to experience it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right? No, absolutely. Because, I mean, I think there are certain skills, I think, that you build because of that, like being able to really debug and even to sort of refactorize your own code that you&#8217;re doing, because you know that if you do it this other way, it&#8217;s going to look bad in this browser. So now you sort of learn all these little eccentricities and stuff like that. So now things are pretty standardized between the browser, I feel like, and I haven&#8217;t done front-end in a while, but I feel like things are pretty standardized now between the modern browsers like Edge, Safari, Chrome, Firefox are pretty much going to render things pretty much the same.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yes. And I think a lot of it&#8217;s like the proliferation of frameworks like the CSS frameworks have helped out with the consistency as well. Right. The browsers have the support built in for a lot of the neat CSS tricks that you can do. But then also a lot of people have adopted these frameworks that have that stuff built in as well. So it just really speeds up the design and development process. And I could say, like, for people that are front end developers and they&#8217;ve moved over to just being a designer, it&#8217;s always been easier to communicate with your engine partners too. So when you need to go into engineering meetings as well, it&#8217;s always refreshing to communicate in their language as much as you can. Right. So it helps you out that way as well, career wise.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, you&#8217;ve said that there&#8217;s no better time to be a designer than now, and I feel like we may have kind of talked about that a little bit now, just with tooling, but expand on that for me. Expand on that thought.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah. So let&#8217;s say FigJam, the collaboration tool within Figma. It has really opened up my world where I could send people just a design, like an early design. They can go in there, they can comment, or we can comment, live the collaboration aspect, especially in the remote world. Obviously we&#8217;re not all in the same space, but it has been world-changing to get early buy in through Figma, through sharing a link and even doing research. The tooling for research has been a lot better over the years. The last ten years, it&#8217;s improved greatly. And so speaking to that, yeah, I&#8217;m all about collaboration tools because we have to do a lot of virtual brainstorm sessions or design sprints. And without having that mechanism, I&#8217;m not sure where we would have been today. We could have probably been doing design sprint in Google Sheets or something like that, right? Which would be terrible. That has just been world changing for me in terms of just building more momentum and getting buy-in. </p>
<p>But also with prototyping. I&#8217;m a big fan of prototyping and I do remember the days of struggling for weeks and weeks through using JavaScript and jQuery to do something relatively simple or maybe I had an idea that&#8217;s kind of elaborate but do not have the technical skills to pull it off. So prototyping in Figma, Origami and some of the other tools that are out in the market today. It&#8217;s like you spend maybe an hour or two going over some tutorials and then all of a sudden you&#8217;re off to the races, making a really immersive, native-feeling prototype that you can view on your phone and even share it. So that&#8217;s why I kind of like saying, I&#8217;m so jealous of all the folks that are becoming designers now because they&#8217;ll never know the pain of taking days or even weeks to do something really simple and sometimes it just ends up being like a throwaway thing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I didn&#8217;t even touch on mobile. But you&#8217;re like, absolutely right about that. I mean, mobile is another thing where a bunch of different environments across different smartphones are going to render things differently. That&#8217;s a whole other part I didn&#8217;t even consider. I&#8217;d say also just education back in the day a lot. I mean, this stuff was really online. We were all just sort of reverse engineering and looking at View Source code and trying to figure stuff out. And there were books that came along eventually because some people might have been a little bit ahead of the curve, but you couldn&#8217;t really go to school for this. And now you have like, Treehouse and you&#8217;ve got General Assembly and there&#8217;s no short share skillshare. There&#8217;s YouTube videos. There&#8217;s so much stuff now around education that just did not exist when we were trying to learn design back then. Especially if you were self taught. Like, if you were self taught, you really were self taught because there were not even just these educational platforms to help you to figure this stuff out. You really were doing a lot of trial and error.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah, great point. I don&#8217;t know how I could even forget that because that was a huge part of my life and career and I felt like I took a long road to get to where I am because of that fact. Back in those days, there were very few tutorials online. You could find some Illustrator tutorials. Shockwave. I&#8217;m trying to think of some other Macromedia products. That ColdFusion. Fireworks. Yeah, you could find some really remedial tutorials out there, but that was about it. And so those early days, I had to go to a bookstore and look at design magazines. I think Computer Arts was a godsend coming from publishing [in] the UK. But yeah, that was it. It&#8217;s like you go to a bookstore and you get all these design books and then I would get some programming books just to see what&#8217;s going on. But like you said, maybe you found a website that was cool and you got to go view Source and like, okay, what&#8217;s going on here? And then you try to break it down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
So, yeah, all this stuff that we have, like, access to education and just these online schools and I love it. I&#8217;m here for it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I remember back in the day I used what was it called? Dynamic Drive. Do you remember Dynamic Drive?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
No.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So Dynamic Drive was the site that basically just had code snippets. Like, they didn&#8217;t really give tutorials. They kind of told you how to implement it, but say you wanted to make it so someone couldn&#8217;t right click on your website. Right? Yeah. You could go to Dynamic Drive and find the code. Snippet copy it, copy it, paste it between the head tags, and then all these different no one could right click. Yeah, they really tell you how it worked. You just were like, oh, this can do this. There was a lot of trust, I&#8217;ll put it that way, that you weren&#8217;t putting something malicious in your site. You would just, oh, copy, paste that and&#8230;oh, God, what&#8217;s the other one I used to use a lot that was sort of more educational based that&#8217;s still around now called&#8230;W3Schools. Yeah, that&#8217;s right. W3Schools. And I remember because I was also teaching design at the time, this was like, what was this, 2011, 2012, maybe? And I remember telling my students, like, don&#8217;t use W3Schools. They call themselves W3Schools because it was www. But I think folks also confused it with the W3C, which is the Worldwide Web Consortium. And I was a member of their Web Education group. And they would tell us, do not tell people to use W3Schools. It is not sanctioned by us. It is not our thing. But it was also still teaching people. It was teaching me how to use some of this stuff. But I would have to tell my students, don&#8217;t use W3Schools. Think of it as a reference, but don&#8217;t just copy and paste stuff from W3Schools and then turn it in as homework, because I&#8217;m going to know that you did that, because I do that, so don&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Oh, my goodness, man. Yes. Absolutely. We said dynamic drive. I wasn&#8217;t even like it didn&#8217;t even ring a bell. But I remember using them to get a script, to do the animated cursor. It had all the types of weird, just weird things. It was almost like the dollar store for scripts.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Not the dollar store! That&#8217;s a very accurate piece of comparison there. Back when HTML&#8230;I think it was called DHTML back then. Yeah. Oh, man, what a time. What a time.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What advice would you give to someone out there who&#8217;s they&#8217;re hearing your story, they want to follow in your footsteps. What advice would you give them?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
You know, as you&#8217;re trying to figure out what aspect of design you may want to focus in? Experiment, try it all. And as we were just talking about, there&#8217;s so many resources online where you don&#8217;t even have to pay a penny to try something out, right. But really just be curious on how things are done, whether it&#8217;s processes related to product design or maybe how to run a design sprint. There&#8217;s so much, and you&#8217;ll kind of eventually find your way. Some people generally know, like, hey, I&#8217;m not a great visual designer, but they want to get more into the UX of things. Right. And that&#8217;s great too. So it&#8217;s all about kind of like, figuring out your career path and what your passions are, what your strong suits are. </p>
<p>For me, I love product design, but I&#8217;m also really heavily into micro-animation, so I lean towards these prototyping tools. But yeah, it&#8217;s like, sky&#8217;s the limit. It&#8217;s kind of like the advice that I would give them informal training. Like, if you are able to get into a good school that has a great product design program, that is awesome. I know Carnegie Mellon has one. Tufts University has, like, an HCI class. I think most big universities these days probably have some facet of, like, a product design class, but then don&#8217;t also have to go to a giant university for this type of an education. Like we already mentioned, it&#8217;s all right there online. Just use the resources that are available to you.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, I noticed that the URL to your website is pathstraightforward.com. What does &#8220;path straight forward&#8221; mean to you, like, in terms of your life and your career?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yeah. So I was trying to have a domain name that sounded relatively cool. And at first, I&#8217;m like, this is not going to have any type of esoteric meaning or anything, but really, it just summarizes the journey that I took in order to get to where I am today. Because it was really long. It was hard, but I knew that I had a plan, and I just kind of stayed focused on the journey and the path moving forward, and that&#8217;s kind of what&#8217;s got me here. And I still have a long way to go.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Where do you see yourself in the next five years? I mean, you&#8217;ve mentioned this kind of tour of duty that you&#8217;ve had around the bay at these different companies and such. What does the future look like for you?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
So there&#8217;s a couple of things. I think I want to start to move more towards design systems because I really do enjoy working with my design systems partners. And so over the years, I&#8217;ve had a number of contributions to different systems that are available. But between that and mentorship becoming, like, having a stronger influence in mentoring younger designers, I mentioned that I was involved in a program here in Oakland, but it&#8217;s really impactful when people can have someone that they can talk to and get directional advice for their career. So I want to have more of a stronger influence in mentorship circles.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, just to kind of wrap things up here, where can our audience where can they find out more information about you, your work and everything? Where can they find that online?</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Yes, you can reach out to me on LinkedIn. So it&#8217;s LinkedIn.com, and it&#8217;s my first and last name, Kevin Tufts. So feel free to connect with me. I am always willing to have a coffee chat with anyone that&#8217;s curious about my background or just really general questions about design and my website since I&#8217;ve been employed for so long. I&#8217;ve kind of taken down a lot of the work there, but also there are some social links in there. You can reach out to me on my website and contact me directly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, sounds good. Kevin Tufts, I want to thank you so much for coming on the show. I mentioned this prior to us recording. We have a mutual colleague, Kim Hutchinson. Now she was Kim Williams when I first interviewed her, but Kim sang about your praises. She was like, &#8220;you got to get Kevin on the show. He&#8217;s such a cool guy. He&#8217;s such a good guy.&#8221; And I can tell just from this conversation, like, she&#8217;s 100% right. You&#8217;re down to earth. You know your stuff. And anybody that I talk to that has been around since the early days of the web that has built stuff from scratch is, like, automatically cool with me because, you know, the trenches that we&#8217;ve had to go through to still be&#8230;I would even say relevant. I want to say that. But to go through the trenches, to still be working and doing what we do now after 20 years is amazing. And I think you certainly built a fantastic career for yourself, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing what you do along with the mentoring track and everything.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So thank you for coming on the show.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tufts:</b><br>
Maurice, thank you. And I really appreciate you having me on the show. And it is awesome that you&#8217;ve got a platform that you can expose different types of people from various backgrounds. So, yeah, man, kudos. I appreciate it.</p>

<p>Chris Dudley is an artistic powerhouse. He&#8217;s been a working artist for over 25 years, creating everything from children&#8217;s books to commissioned drawings (and he teaches art as well). His latest book, <a href="https://www.hudsondawnpublishing.com/bookstore/p/lil-boogaloo-shrimp-and-the-clean-sweep" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><i>Lil&#8217; Boogaloo Shrimp and the Clean Sweep</i></a> is inspired by the iconic 80&#8217;s movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086998/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><em>Breakin&#8217;</em></a>, and features the OG Boogaloo Shrimp himself, Michael Chambers! </p>
<p>Chris gave me the rundown on the new book, and we talked about his creative process and what draws him to illustrating portraits and children&#8217;s books. He also spoke about growing up in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the benefits on staying there for his career, the keys to his longevity, his work with Hudson Dawn Publishing, and dropped some great advice on work/life balance and staying inspired. You&#8217;ll definitely be a fan of Chris after you hear his story &#8212; I know I am!</p>

<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All right, so tell us who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Well, my name is Chris Dudley and I am the creative director for Chris Dudley Art. I really focus on art and illustration.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has 2023 been going for you so far?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Actually, it has been going amazing. The scope and range of projects that I&#8217;ve been working on have been just straight fun. The recent project has been Lil&#8217; Boogaloo Shrimp and the Clean Sweep, which is with Michael Chambers, who&#8217;s famous from the breakdancing movies franchises, and it&#8217;s been amazing.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, tell me some more about the book.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, it&#8217;s, I think, the first book of its kind. Scoured the internet, and I haven&#8217;t seen a book like this. One of the first books I&#8217;ve ever seen that focuses on breakdancing. The premise behind the book is that it teaches kids responsibility and priority using breakdancing. And also, it highlights, there&#8217;s a shout-out of a lot of the actors from the Breakin&#8217; movies, Adolfo Qui√±ones, Bruno Falcon, and sadly, we lost both of them recently, and just all of the main characters from the breaking movie, but also a lot of other individuals.</p>
<p>And in addition to having that subject matter about breakdancing, because a lot of people think it went by the wayside, but it&#8217;s still hugely popular and also, it will debut in the Olympics in 2024. And so, it&#8217;s still a huge thing. There&#8217;s a shout-out to the Olympics in the book. Actually, the final spread, everybody&#8217;s breakdancing in Paris with the Eiffel Tower in the background.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah, I haven&#8217;t seen a book like this yet.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. Congratulations on that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Thank you. It also, if I could add, it&#8217;s more than just a children&#8217;s book, it gives kids a little bit of history about the background of breaking, its roots in New York. Also, gives some terminology of breaking, like what a freeze is, what a go down is. So, it&#8217;s a little bit more than just the story.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I remember this was back in 2005. When was I working there? Yeah, 2005, I was working for the State of Georgia here in Atlanta, working at the Georgia World Congress Center. And I remember we had just hired this white girl as a PR rep or something. And I mean cute, short, bubbly white girl. I was like, &#8220;Oh, she seems really nice.&#8221; And the weird thing, well, not the weird thing, but as I was talking to her and I asked her what her hobbies was and she was like, &#8220;Breakdancing.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You&#8217;re a breakdancer? You look like a UGA sorority grad. Come on, you&#8217;re not a breakdancer.&#8221; And sure enough, it would be in a sort of weird way, but sometimes she would do moves just in the office just to show us that, &#8220;Yeah, I am a breakdancer.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Gotcha.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
She invited me to a few events that she was breaking at and-</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It was so weird because sometimes we&#8217;d be in these board meetings, in a legit boardroom with chairman and stuff, and then someone&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re a breakdancer. Why don&#8217;t you bust a move for us?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, in a way, this is so embarrassing, but also, it&#8217;s like, well, at least you&#8217;re not asking the Black person to do it, so I&#8217;m not&#8230; Let me sit back and watch the show.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Gotcha. That&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. And I think you told me that part of what you&#8217;re doing with the book involves a crew or something here in Atlanta.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yes, they&#8217;re in Georgia. I think they&#8217;re near Acworth, the Rockwell Dance Academy. And it&#8217;s interesting that you mentioned that the young lady there was a breakdancer, but the Rockwell Dance Academy is led by Honey Rockwell and Orko. Honey Rockwell is a staple name as a B-girl. Actually, just last year, they were both inducted into the Breaking Hall of Fame. And so, B-girls definitely have a place as well. I mean, she&#8217;s one of the most well-known. She was with the original Rock Steady Crew in South Bronx, New York.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, nice.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah. We partnered with them and we&#8217;ve got some things in the works. So, it&#8217;s really exciting to have that Georgia connection going.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, we&#8217;ll make sure to put a link to the book also in the show notes, so people can check that out. Aside from this new project, how are things different for you this year than they were last year?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
It has been just ramping up with projects. Last year, obviously, we had a steady flow of projects, variety. This year, the children&#8217;s books have just been packed. I mean, I&#8217;m booked out with children&#8217;s books, booked out away. So, it&#8217;s fun where you complete one project and then you can look forward to the next one. But I&#8217;ve got, I think, four or five that are already in the queue, confirmed. And so, I look forward to working with each of those authors as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Nice. I mean, with everything that you&#8217;ve got going on now, what does the summer look like? Is it more work or you got any plans?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah, a little vacation, a little relaxation I would do with the family for the summer. I&#8217;ve got three girls and my wife, so we&#8217;ll get a little relaxation in, but some work too. Especially with the release of this book, Lil&#8217; Boogaloo Shrimp and the Clean Sweep, we&#8217;ve got some events planned this summer as well. Some here in Michigan with the Children&#8217;s Museum and another bookstore, and actually, a local breakdancing crew.</p>
<p>Actually, Michael Chambers there in Los Angeles, July 29th, I believe, he&#8217;s got an event with Barnes &#038; Noble. So, I may be flying out there to support him on that. But yeah, we&#8217;ve got a lot going on this summer. Then coming out of summer, we look to get in, we&#8217;re going to be partnering with some schools to get the books into schools as well.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Very nice. So, you got a lot planned coming up.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yes, sir.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s dive into Chris Dudley Art. I mean, you just mentioned you&#8217;ve got a bunch of these projects that are lined up. What does your creative process look like when you&#8217;re working on a new project?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, they all start similarly because we do a little bit of design work. We&#8217;ve designed some logos and so forth. We&#8217;ve got a team that does that. But also with the illustration, I like to start out old school with sketching. That&#8217;s how I learned to draw. So, that&#8217;s part of my creative process with every project, is starting out with sketching. I mean, I can go into the meat of doing a children&#8217;s book, if you like.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Okay. It&#8217;s basically we get a manuscript and it goes through an approval process. We don&#8217;t just take any manuscript. It&#8217;s got to&#8230; Just to be real with you, when I read the manuscript, if images start popping into my head, it&#8217;s a go. If they don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s probably not a go. And that&#8217;s just nothing against the author, but it has to resonate with me because it&#8217;s got to be a fun project that I&#8217;m looking forward to doing.</p>
<p>And so, from there, the manuscript checks out and we want to bid on that. From there, we will establish the illustration description. So, that&#8217;s what imagery is going to go along with what portions of the text, especially if it&#8217;s a children&#8217;s picture book. And once we nail that down, I&#8217;ll do sketches. And that&#8217;s where you establish the composition. Well, actually, prior to that, we design the characters, the main characters, and see exactly what they&#8217;re going to look like. Is it a eight-year-old African American boy, or does it have to be a little girl who&#8217;s three years old and she has a puppy?</p>
<p>So, we have to figure out the dynamics of the characters. What are they going to look like? What time period are we in? Are we in the 2000s? Are we in the &#8217;80s, like with our recent book here? And so, we establish a character and then we do composition sketches of establishing what each scene is going to look like. And those get approved by the author along the way. So, they&#8217;re heavily involved with the creative process, so that I don&#8217;t just come up with the finished project and then hope they like it. They&#8217;re involved along the way so that there&#8217;s no surprises on either end.</p>
<p>Then from there, we go to final sketches. We start to flesh out this is exactly what this spot illustration or this full page or this spread is exactly going to look like and the details of it, if there&#8217;s need to be background and so forth. And from there, after the client approves that, we do the line work. That&#8217;s where we finalize it almost&#8230; Well, you&#8217;re familiar with how a coloring book looks where you have the simple black lines.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yup.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
We finish out the book looking like that. That way the client gets to see, okay, this is exactly how things are going to look before we add color. In that way, any adjustments can be made along the way, if need be. So, they approve each process, and then we get into the color theory, because you can&#8217;t just throw colors onto the imagery. It has to make sense visually. Also, colors such as red is going to attract attention. So, you wouldn&#8217;t just arbitrarily use that just because you want it red. And sometimes, that has to be explained to the client as well, because they may think, &#8220;I want to paint this in a blue.&#8221; That, well, based on color theory, those won&#8217;t work with the composition.</p>
<p>Then we just move toward the formatting process, and then the text is added. And I take the text into consideration as well though when I&#8217;m designing the composition, so it doesn&#8217;t look forced later. I make sure I allow spacing for that. But yeah, that&#8217;s how we move through a project. Then from there, it goes to post-production, and then we have a book.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, it&#8217;s way more than just art and illustration.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You&#8217;re really seeing it through the entire process, entire publishing process.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah, from concept to completion is what we&#8217;d call it. Yeah, from the initial idea to a finished book.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I mean, you mentioned getting the clients involved with it. I&#8217;m pretty sure this is probably maybe not an exhaustive process for them, but how is it for them being able to see the book come together step by step like this?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
It&#8217;s amazing because it&#8217;s no secret most people haven&#8217;t learned the skill of being able to draw, let alone to illustrate, which is there&#8217;s a difference because with illustration, you&#8217;re telling a story with the imagery. And so, when you flesh out a character for a client, it&#8217;s so satisfying because they have it in their head, but they can&#8217;t see it. And so, when you can present that to them, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s exactly what I want.&#8221; It&#8217;s just so gratifying for them. Then to see that character then doing things throughout the book, their eyes just light up. So, it&#8217;s a pleasure working with them and again, keeping them involved in the process.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, it looks like you do a lot of children&#8217;s book illustrations. What draws you to this genre?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Well, having kids. Like I said, I got three girls. They&#8217;re a little bit older now into late teens, mid and late teens. But I actually spent, and actually people can go look at my website at chrisdudleyart.com, I spent about 15, 20 years doing almost exclusively realism. I mean very detailed graphite drawings. I did art shows and juried exhibitions and all of that. And so, I used that knowledge actually as I segued into, I still do some of that, but the children&#8217;s books, reading books to my girls. And I actually had to learn how to illustrate better. I knew it a little bit, but I had to really dive into it. So, I&#8217;ve been doing that for the past 10 years now, and it&#8217;s taken over really.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you stay organized with a lot of these projects? Because I would imagine as you&#8217;re saying this whole process, do you do just one book at a time? Are you juggling multiple books? How do you keep all of that managed effectively?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Well, some of them will overlap a little bit, but it depends on what phase of the process. Honestly, for me personally, the most challenging part is the initial part, coming up with the concept of what the imagery is going to look like. Because once you&#8217;ve established that, you then created a roadmap for yourself, and then it&#8217;s just following the roadmap. It&#8217;s almost like plotting out your course somewhere. That&#8217;s the hardest part, where am I going to go with this? But then once you plot out the course, okay, now, it&#8217;s just following this path that I&#8217;ve laid out.</p>
<p>And there may be some tweaks along the way. And with that, it&#8217;s important obviously not to overbook. We&#8217;ve all heard the same under promise, over deliver. And so, really, we really focus on with my team, especially my assistant, not making promises that would be too difficult to even try to make happen. Then you&#8217;re disappointing clients. So, books, I won&#8217;t work on two or three at the same time, but they may overlap. Like okay, if I finish this portion, now I can maybe bring in, but they&#8217;ll have different deadlines. I don&#8217;t have it where they&#8217;re all due at the same time. Keeping it balanced, yeah.</p>
<p>Then we filter in some other relatively smaller projects in there while I may be working on a book, like a one-off illustration or a design project. But I like to really focus on that client&#8217;s project, so they get the attention that it needs.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it&#8217;s important to note, as you&#8217;ve alluded to, you have a team. So, this isn&#8217;t a one-man operation.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly. I could not do it by myself. I did in the past. Obviously, it was just me. I started, well, way, way back before it was Chris Dudley Art when I was 18, 19. And it was just me, invoicing and trying to figure all this stuff out. But I realized later is that it stifled creativity, doing all of those other administrative tasks. Now, I still do some, but by and large, I want to save my brain for the project.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think, as you said, starting out on your own, you want to try to do everything or try to tackle everything because you&#8217;re just starting out. You want to establish yourself. But eventually after a while, in order for you to really be able to go further, you have to give up some control. You have to build a team. It&#8217;s just a necessary part of being able to scale the work that you do.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly, exactly. Yeah, it&#8217;s necessary.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Let&#8217;s switch gears a little bit here and learn more about you. You talked a bit about starting out. You were born and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Tell me about what that was like.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yes, it was fun. My interest in art started very young. I had a couple of cousins that drew a little bit. One was just phenomenal, phenomenal artist, and it amazed me that he could do that with a pencil. And it wasn&#8217;t daunting like it may be to some people. And in school, I always drew. I remember back in, I think I was maybe in kindergarten or first grade, and a little weed of mine, it was like a stalk of grain or something that I drew, it got accepted in the children&#8217;s exhibition at the Grand Rapids Art Museum.</p>
<p>And so, it&#8217;s like that was a &#8220;first juried show&#8221; and it was accepted. And so, it&#8217;s going to be on display Downtown Grand Rapids at the Art Museum. And so, when my mom took me down there to see it and to see it displayed, it was just awe-inspiring. They had the artwork separated by grade level. So, mine was in the first, second-graders. And I remember walking and seeing, I remember the stuff like it&#8217;s yesterday, seeing the 12th graders. Obviously, their art advancement was far beyond my level, but it was so amazing that it was possible, and it just sparked that that&#8217;s possible. I didn&#8217;t have the skill to do it, but it didn&#8217;t deter me. It made me understand that&#8217;s possible. I can get to that level. And so, that&#8217;s where it began.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it sounds like your family also really supported you in this too.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah, family has always supported me. Even teachers, I joke about it now, they would let me draw in class as long as I did my work, obviously. But yeah, I&#8217;ve had a lot of support over the years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has it been working and cultivating your career in the same place where you grew up? I feel like a lot of folks we have on the show may have, of course, started out one place and then ended up moving somewhere else, and that was where their career or their work flourished. What does it mean for you to still be in your hometown doing this work?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Well, it&#8217;s taken some time. I started out with, it was Dudley Graphics actually, when I was 18, 19. And I was doing T-shirt designs and it was all by hand. I didn&#8217;t know graphic design or how to use a computer or anything. So, I was drawing things and even drawing lettering and so forth, and later rebranded. Actually, when I improved my drawing ability, I was okay, but I wanted to learn how to draw much, much better. And so, in my 20s, I said I want to learn this and really buckled down and improved my skill, but had obviously some success with that, dealing with some businesses and so forth.</p>
<p>But later, that&#8217;s when I started doing juried art shows. And I felt that if I could get into a juried art show, that somewhat vetted my skillset. Then some of these were hard to get into. They were hard to get into. So, that gave me a little boost of confidence. Then figuring out how to make it sustainable, like you said, in your hometown and doing projects with companies. I actually did a whiteboard animation with a pharma, very large, I can&#8217;t say the name, but pharmaceutical company. And so, finding avenues then how to make it sustainable.</p>
<p>And I was able to explore a lot of different avenues of art. I mean, it was design. It was drawing. There was a little bit of animation work with some of that, but to make it more sustainable even here locally. But then things did branch out where I started getting a little attention from those outside of Michigan. I worked with an author actually in Georgia, and just some throughout the States. And that&#8217;s when it&#8217;s like, whoa, it opens you up to that global market.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Do you think it&#8217;s been a benefit to you to still do this work in Grand Rapids? Have you thought about, &#8220;Oh, well, what if I was in New York?&#8221; Or even in Detroit, if you stayed in Michigan?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yes. I found it as a benefit because it puts me in a position to, it sounds cliche, but to give back, if you will, to the community versus when you move away, you&#8217;re not in touch with that local community anymore. So, I&#8217;ve been able to be in contact with local artists that I know and local authors, because I work with a lot of authors here in Michigan. So, to be able to meet them in some instances face to face, you can&#8217;t replace that. It&#8217;s worked out. It&#8217;s just worked out for me to stay here in Michigan and still have some of those connects outside.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How big is Grand Rapids? I&#8217;m trying to think population wise, how big.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Ooh, offhand, I guess I should know this, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, no.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Actually, it&#8217;s the second&#8230; I didn&#8217;t know I was getting a geography lesson here. It&#8217;s the second-largest city, obviously, behind Detroit. I mean, it&#8217;s growing too. It&#8217;s continuing to grow. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, I mean, I&#8217;m curious about that because I&#8217;ve had folks that are on the show before that aren&#8217;t in these big metropolises. They&#8217;re in smaller cities like Raleigh or Grand Rapids, like you mentioned. I think I talked to another illustrator in Detroit. Oh, his name escapes. I think it&#8217;s Sean Bell or something like that. But talking about the benefit or one inherent benefit of being able to do this work in a smaller community, I won&#8217;t say small, but smaller than a big city, is that in a way, because you grew up there, people know you, so there&#8217;s that sort of reputation. But also, you help serve as a beacon for the next generation to see that what you&#8217;re doing is possible where they are. They don&#8217;t have to move somewhere else or go somewhere else to achieve-</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; the kind of success that you&#8217;ve achieved.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. That is the key. And a lot of it is about developing your skillset, really getting your work seen. And so, with the internet and so forth, I&#8217;m not old, but I grew up without the internet. But now, you have these different vehicles that you can use to have your work seen really all over the world.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Before we get into that, I want to stay a little bit in the pocket of Dudley Graphics because I think it&#8217;s important for our audience to really hear about what it was like to design really before personal computers and Photoshop and all that sort of stuff was really a thing. Tell me about your early career of Dudley Graphics because that was roughly between what, &#8217;96 and 2005, 2006, something like that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yep, exactly. Yeah. I started out, man, I was 18 and I became a broker with a T-shirt company and I was doing the designing. And like you said, it was all by hand. I mean, it was freehand drawing. Then I would ink it and I would take actual ink drawings to my screen printer to get the camera ready, iron it and so forth. And so, if I had to make an adjustment, it was all by hand and cutting and pasting and whiteout. I did not know how to use a computer. I didn&#8217;t have one. So, it was the early days.</p>
<p>I remember when I first got a computer and trying to learn it, but I didn&#8217;t really have the correct software. Then had thought, &#8220;Okay, how do I input something in my computer?&#8221; So, I had to try to learn a scanner and it was crazy. One thing that really helped, I actually worked at a Kinko&#8217;s, which later became FedEx Kinko&#8217;s, and which is now FedEx office. And I got a lot of training actually in graphic design and just how those things worked. And that really helped me with launching Dudley Graphics.</p>
<p>Again, it was just in the design and T-shirt realm because my drawing ability honestly was, I would say, above average, but above average was to be average person who doesn&#8217;t draw. So, I had a ways to go as far as learning how to draw better. And that&#8217;s what prompted the rebrand, is I felt, &#8220;Okay, my skills are way better than they were. So, I can go with this art thing.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Oh, you took me back there with talking about Kinko&#8217;s. I remember that fondly.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Okay, yeah. Yep. Yep.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, during that time, I was in high school, right around that time. I was 18 in &#8217;99. So, a little bit later than you were, but I did come up also in that time of life before the internet. I mean, computers actually when I was a kid were almost like a toy.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
At least that&#8217;s how they were marketed or pushed. It was like, oh, this is the fun thing you do at school in your free period or-</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It would be VTech. The company VTech had all these personal computer things. I had this big thing called a Precomputer 1000 that had a one-line screen on it. It had a full keyboard, but had a one-line screen and it had a handle on it so you could carry it with you. I think my mom wanted to throw that thing out the window because it could also make sound. And so, I was learning sound because I also grew up playing music, being a musician. So, I&#8217;m learning how to play sound and code on this thing. And I know she wanted to launch that thing out the window most days.</p>
<p>But I say all that to say it&#8217;s so different now when you look at schools. And even, I think, just the general conversation around technology for children and designs. It&#8217;s certainly something that people try to push their kids into as a viable career field or a moneymaking thing or something like that. Really back then, especially for Black folks, there was not a lot of examples. You had, what, Dwayne Wayne on A Different World. Maybe somebody that was featured in Black enterprise if you had a subscription. So, there wasn&#8217;t a lot around, oh, computers are a thing that you can use to build your career. It wasn&#8217;t a thing. And I feel like for listeners they should, especially younger listeners, it just wasn&#8217;t a thing.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah, it wasn&#8217;t. It wasn&#8217;t. I think, what is it? What would you say? 2000s before, I think, when the internet came out for everyday people and people still didn&#8217;t have a computer in their home. Whereas now, most people do. But you think about to have grown up or have grown up at a time where that you didn&#8217;t have internet at home, you didn&#8217;t have a computer at home even. So, totally, it was a different era.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Or if you had an internet at home, it was via mail order CD.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah, AOL.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
You get a AOL CD. You get a NetZero disc in the mail or something like that. And that&#8217;s what you use-</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; to get on for like&#8230; I remember getting those things and it&#8217;s like a thousand free minutes.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly. Oh, my gosh. Yes, I remember that too. Then you&#8217;re waiting five minutes to connect, just listening to that dial-up sound.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And it ties up the phone. So, if someone&#8217;s on the internet, someone also can&#8217;t be on the phone in the house.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, it was a whole thing. So, I used the computers at school and I learned it at school. I designed my high school newspaper, for example, and we used PageMaker. We&#8217;d use a double PageMaker.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
PageMaker.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I know we started off trying to use Quark and those-</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah, QuarkXPress.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That software would come with these big&#8230; I mean, these instruction manuals could choke a horse. It would be so thick, and it&#8217;s like a textbook. How am I supposed to read through all this to figure out how to use this software on this thing? And eventually, we&#8217;re just like, &#8220;We&#8217;ll just do it by hand.&#8221; It&#8217;s just easier to print and cut-</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; and copy and all that sort of stuff. So, I know what you mean about having that not necessarily on the job training, but you learned through application. You didn&#8217;t necessarily go to school for. You learned by doing or you learned by working almost like an apprenticeship in a way.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely, definitely. And along with that, just to add briefly, is that in that manner, you learn what you need because all these programs, obviously Adobe Photoshop, it&#8217;s so deep that even the experts don&#8217;t use everything, right?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
But I think a lot of us artists and entrepreneurs may&#8230; It can be daunting, but you may realize that I only need five functions from this program to run my business. I don&#8217;t need to know all 5,000 and shortcuts and all that. And so, it&#8217;s really finding what you need, and okay, that&#8217;s all I need from this program. Then it&#8217;s worth it for me to have it to run my business.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. And the chokehold that Adobe and Macromedia back then as well, the chokehold that those products had on the burgeoning digital design industry cannot be understated. I never thought I&#8217;d see a day where Photoshop is almost not derided, but I know a lot of designers now will use Figma over Photoshop. There was a time when they would use Sketch over Photoshop. I never thought I&#8217;d see a time when Photoshop would fall out of favor because it was everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yep, yep. And also, I think a lot of people are still upset about the subscription model. But I guess I get it. You get the updates. You don&#8217;t have to come up off of $900, which a lot of people couldn&#8217;t back in the day anyway. Or they&#8217;re working on old versions of Photoshop and there&#8217;s, like you said, a lot of options now. I do a lot of illustration in Procreate on the iPad Pro.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I think Adobe knew that their software was being pirated left and right. I didn&#8217;t buy Photoshop until the subscription came out. Everything before them was some cracked version off of LimeWire or Kazaa or whatever that I hoped would not give my computer a virus. And sometimes, it would. But that&#8217;s how I ended up learning because I was like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t afford.&#8221; Even when I had my business, I was like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t afford the cost of this. I&#8217;ll still use this cracked version because it works. It does what I need it to do.&#8221; Like you said, it does the five things-</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; I need it to do. Why would I pay this astronomical amount of money for this piece of software if I can&#8217;t use every single part of it?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. Now, you&#8217;ve been a working illustrator in this industry now for over 25 years. For you, what have been the keys to sustain that longevity? We&#8217;ve talked just now about how technology has really changed the game. How do you still keep current and maintain yourself in this industry?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
First thing is skillset. When it comes to art, you have to have the skillset and it&#8217;s not&#8230; Obviously, no disrespect to anyone, but a lot of times people think about art as it&#8217;s just a feeling and you just express yourself. And there are some aspects of art that are that way, but there are rules and fundamentals that you learn. Composition, you have to know anatomy. There&#8217;s so many things and you have to learn that stuff before you can just venture off and draw your feelings if you want to say. And so, I really focus on that skillset, learning those things.</p>
<p>Also, art is a different pursuit in that everyone else has to be&#8230; They understand that I got to be good at it first before someone&#8217;s going to hire me. If you were a baker, I got to be able to bake cookies good first. So, you&#8217;re going to be baking a lot. If you&#8217;re a singer, you have to show that you can sing. If you&#8217;re a writer, you have to write the book. But oftentimes, artists, some artists, new ones anyway, feel, &#8220;Well, I want someone to hire me to draw something.&#8221; Well, you have to show them that you can draw.</p>
<p>And so, I think a lot of artists don&#8217;t have enough of a body of work to show for someone to hire them, so that&#8217;s what I&#8230; I didn&#8217;t want to do that. And early stages I went through were, okay, you want someone. Then I realized that, no, you have to be drawing and producing things so people can see that you know how to do this thing. And when I took that approach, things really just really started to take off. And it can&#8217;t just be your practicing. You need to do a project from start to finish. People can see that you can do that, the highest level you can do at that time. And so, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s really helped me.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, working in public. Like they say in math class, show your work. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s really been a big key for you.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, and being able to show that you can. It&#8217;s not waiting to be asked to do it or waiting to be hired to do it. And that&#8217;s what a lot of artists do. Again, no other industry is that way. You know that you have to have this skill at a high level before someone&#8217;s going to ask you to do it for pay. But sometimes, artists just wait. I&#8217;m waiting for someone to hire me. I&#8217;m just sketching in my sketchbook. Well, no, do a project. Even if you &#8220;hire yourself&#8221; to do a project, show that you have the chops to do it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How has tech impacted your work? Of course, we&#8217;ve talked about Photoshop and things like that, but lately, over the past almost nine to 10 months now, the conversation has largely been around generative art and Midjourney and DALL-E and all this stuff. Yes. How does that, if at all, incorporate into your work?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
I have switched over. I&#8217;m almost&#8230; Well, I still draw because I love the tactile aspect of just traditional media. Actually, I&#8217;m going to be teaching a paint class this week, but the majority of the bulk of my work is digital now. So, I&#8217;m drawing on a tablet. And with regard to art, that&#8217;s&#8230; Well, if I could add, one funny thing to me is, in the art community, drawing hands because of their nature is difficult for just about every artist starting out. And so, one hilarious thing to me is that AI art can&#8217;t draw hands either, and that&#8217;s something&#8230;</p>
<p>I knew someone who, well, just recently they produced a book. And I said, I&#8217;ve looked at it like, &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s a nice image.&#8221; But then I started, just from my trained eye, started to break away. No, this is AI. Again, not to discredit it, but I could tell right away it was AI produced. Then I looked at the hands and they looked atrocious, like claws. And I was like, &#8220;Oh, yep, I was right. That&#8217;s definitely AI.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, I don&#8217;t think, I don&#8217;t see it as a battle per se, but I use digital aids, if you will. Sometimes, I&#8217;ll even create a scene with poseable characters if I&#8217;m looking for a certain pose. And I might take a picture of that and then use that as a reference. So, I&#8217;d use some different aids, but I think you have to have the skillset. The tools can&#8217;t make you an artist. So, you got to have the skillset behind it. People can&#8217;t think, &#8220;Oh, hey, I&#8217;ve got Midjourney now. I&#8217;m an artist all of a sudden.&#8221; No, you still need a certain base of knowledge and ability to be able to then use those tools to actually create art.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I was watching some video. I think it was from Wired, and it was an AI artist detailing their steps. And it&#8217;s all writing for the most part because you have to get the prompts specific in order for the thing to generate and all that sort of stuff. And it was fascinating to see it come together, but it didn&#8217;t feel like art. It didn&#8217;t feel like the creative process, especially with something as I think intimate as hand drawing something. There&#8217;s more that goes into it than, I think, just a technical skill. I mean it&#8217;s creativity. It&#8217;s emotion. There&#8217;s a lot of specifically, individually, intrinsically, fundamentally human things that go into the creation that the computer just can&#8217;t do. It can maybe-</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; try to replicate it from other sources. And of course, there&#8217;s been talk about how these engines crib from other artists, but it&#8217;s not the same. I find a lot of AI art has a specific look. It&#8217;s like heavily shadowed and it&#8217;s a very specific look where I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s AI.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s from a person because people&#8217;s art styles are so varied and different.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly. And it&#8217;s very static as well, and some of it&#8217;s&#8230; I mean, obviously, you&#8217;ve got a trained eye to be able to see that but not to, I don&#8217;t want to sound condescending, but to a person that just says, &#8220;Oh, I like pretty things,&#8221; but they&#8217;re not into art or know, they don&#8217;t know art, they could just see an image and, &#8220;Wow, it&#8217;s a pretty image.&#8221; But if you&#8217;ve got a little bit of a trained eye, you can realize, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s nice. But it&#8217;s a static image. There&#8217;s no emotion.&#8221; Like you said, you could feel that it doesn&#8217;t have that human element to it. It&#8217;s just produced. It&#8217;s like a mass-produced restaurant versus a high-end restaurant or that little mom-and-pop shop that puts love into the meal. So, you can tell the difference.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, like a McDonald&#8217;s hamburger is going to be different from-</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; the Smashburger place or something like that.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly, exactly. And there&#8217;s a reason that there&#8217;s always going to be that Smashburger. Yeah, you have the McDonald&#8217;s customers, but there&#8217;s a lot of people that says, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t go to McDonald&#8217;s. I rather pay a few more dollars for a real burger.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
And I think, for you, because the work that you do involves the clients in the process from start to finish, it would almost feel like introducing AI into it, one, sort of cheapens it in a way, but then two, I could see how it could make the client think, &#8220;Wait a minute, I could do this myself.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. Definitely could, definitely. And I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to&#8230; Who knows with technology, but there&#8217;s just what I see certain elements that AI just can&#8217;t do. You have to be able to, just with what I do with illustration, you have to be able to change the POV. Am I going to go with a bird&#8217;s eye view or worm&#8217;s eye view? What about the expression on their face? And AI can&#8217;t do that now. They can&#8217;t take a character and then put it through all these emotions and all these angles and add these other el-&#8230; You can&#8217;t replace the human element, like you said.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, AI can&#8217;t get inspired.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It can&#8217;t get inspired from a work or a piece of music or a feeling. It just tries to recopy and regenerate from whatever it&#8217;s been fed into their model.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah, yeah, definitely.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
So, we spoke about just social media and these platforms and stuff. How do you approach marketing and promoting your work? Are there specific strategies that you found to be pretty effective?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
I really try to let the work speak, but also letting yourself be known as well. Because people do, that&#8217;s something I realized, they do like to know the artists behind the work. So, periodically posting a picture of yourself with the art and so forth, or even doing a little video or something. Everybody wants, I want a million followers and so forth. But then I started realizing I don&#8217;t need a million followers. I&#8217;m booked out with work, and I don&#8217;t know how many I had on Instagram. I don&#8217;t even think a thousand, but I&#8217;m booked with work. I have more work than I can do.</p>
<p>And so, that really changed my whole thought process of&#8230; Then I don&#8217;t want to be putting all my energies or time just into social media when I want to put that into the creative process, and it has worked for me. It has worked. I focus on my skillset and focus on putting projects out and more work comes. And so, I think having the presence though, obviously, is so crucial. Having a website, I think, is very valuable because it really gives a place where this is your work and you&#8217;re not competing for attention on social media platform, but then you could have those platforms that direct people to your site as well.</p>
<p>So, I think it&#8217;s necessary in today&#8217;s age, especially with the visual aspect of doing art, but focus on the work though. Don&#8217;t spend all of your time social media marketing, and then you forget to actually be producing artwork.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Right. Because the followers don&#8217;t necessarily translate into work. It may translate into visibility.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Into more eyes on it, but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that&#8230; And also, you may be attracting the wrong type of clients or the wrong type of people.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
The tire kickers and the low ballers and stuff. They see what you do and they don&#8217;t get the value in it. They just see it and think it&#8217;s something that could be potentially easily replicated.</p>
<p>Actually, going back a little bit to the AI conversation, one thing I thought that was super interesting is when people started getting those AI art, AI generated avatars out, how many people were, I guess complaining, but they were like, &#8220;Wait a minute, you paid for that? You paid for that? You paid how much for that?&#8221; Some people. Well, the cost wasn&#8217;t what it would cost you to actually commission an artist. It was much, much, much cheaper, maybe $5, $8.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
$20.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
For several images, not just one image. And it was so funny seeing people like, &#8220;You paid for that? You paid money for that?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;If you were to pay an artist to do it-</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8230; you would pay the artist. Do you expect it to be free?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah. Oh, man, that&#8217;s a whole other story too, because art is no other industry, well, maybe photography possibly, but no other industry do people expect you to work for free because people think it&#8217;s just maybe some God given talent so you&#8217;re supposed to share it for free. And there&#8217;s times, obviously, where you&#8217;ll be giving with your skillset. But you don&#8217;t go to a mechanic and say, &#8220;Hey, if you fix my car, I will tell all of my friends that you&#8217;re a great mechanic and that&#8217;s going to get you some more work.&#8221; But people do that to artists all the time. It&#8217;s hilarious, man. It&#8217;s hilarious.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I&#8217;ll tell you from doing this show, they do it to podcasters too. They&#8217;re like-</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re just talking to a mic. All you&#8217;re doing is just press and record. That&#8217;s it.&#8221; No.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
There&#8217;s so much more that goes into it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah, they don&#8217;t see the art behind it.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Then when you try to show them, they feel like, &#8220;Oh, well, this is too much.&#8221; Once they get an idea of what the process is and how it is a skilled thing, then it turns them off. From then, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, now you know.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yep, exactly. And to speak to what we&#8217;re touching on, that&#8217;s what, again, versus just I want to become a social media marketer, that&#8217;s what has gotten more work, focusing on the work and then the relationships that I build with my clients. And when we onboard a new author and they see what&#8217;s involved, they see what you&#8217;re doing to bring their vision to life, that has gotten me more work than marketing on social media.</p>
<p>And so, that&#8217;s when it&#8217;s that shift of, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ll post and I&#8217;ll talk about stuff.&#8221; Plus, I&#8217;m not a salesman per se, so I&#8217;m not trying to hard sell, &#8220;Hey, come buy my book.&#8221; No. Here&#8217;s we created this book. It was a fun project. You can look at it a little bit. And people have bought from that versus me trying to hard sell them. And with regard to more work because then that author speaks highly of the experience they had working with you. That has gotten me so much more work where I have other authors call so and so.</p>
<p>I just finished up a book with Erica Flores, first time author. It&#8217;s been an amazing process. That has led to more work. And so, focusing on the skillset, and obviously, your working with clients far exceeds just trying to beg people to buy your products online.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, I 100% agree with that. And also, because if you&#8217;re focusing on social media, as we&#8217;ve seen fairly recently, these platforms can change at the drop of a hat. If you&#8217;re busy trying to chase the algorithm, if you&#8217;re busy trying to market or make your work fit into whatever this opaque algorithm is in terms of visibility or something like that, it takes away from the work. I think we certainly see it with people that create content for video, like YouTubers, TikTokers. It&#8217;s a lot to try to figure it out. And even on maybe non-video platforms like Twitter or Instagram, Instagram is still pictures, but a lot of Instagram now is video.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yes, it is. It is.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Then with Twitter and this Twitter Blue, they&#8217;ve changed the weighting of how people see your work unless you pay for a subscription. The platforms have gotten so, I don&#8217;t want to say unreliable, but they certainly have gotten so caustic and to the point where you can&#8217;t really depend on those to get the word out or to get the work out.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
It helps. It still is a megaphone, but you can&#8217;t depend on just that to be the thing that propels your work or propels you into whatever the next level is.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Definitely. And that&#8217;s why, like I mentioned, having your own website is so crucial. And again, I started before the internet. Well, not just before the internet, but when the internet was starting out, it was before all of the social media platforms. And so, I had a website even way back then. Whereas I see a lot of artists now that pretty good work, but they don&#8217;t have a website, and it&#8217;s just shocking to me. And they think, &#8220;I&#8217;m just going to get all kinds of work from Instagram.&#8221; Maybe if you were in the inception, but if you&#8217;re starting out right now and thinking, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to start an Instagram and get all kinds of work&#8221; and you don&#8217;t have a website, it&#8217;s not going to happen.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. I know even from just trying to reach artists or folks to have on the show, it&#8217;s always tough to get them on if they don&#8217;t have a site, because even if I send them a DM, the way that the filtering is, they may not ever see it, if I send them something on Instagram, if I send them something on Twitter.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
If they even allow you to send them a message, and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, do you want people to contact you or not?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s the point? Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
How do you balance your artistic pursuits with your personal life and responsibilities? You mentioned your marriage. You&#8217;ve got three kids. How do you balance all of that?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Well, again, with booking, I don&#8217;t just accept any and all projects. I&#8217;d be with a privilege to be in that position where I don&#8217;t have to take all work that comes my way. I can be a little choosy and making sure that I&#8217;m prioritizing that time with my wife. We just hit 25 years.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
So, that&#8217;s a huge milestone, and with our three girls and prioritizing that time. I love doing this. Obviously, there&#8217;s a monetary component to take care of my family and so forth. But I often think about too is that there&#8217;s time that I can&#8217;t sell a client. That&#8217;s for my wife and for my family, but then often think, but the time that I do sell you, if you will, you&#8217;re not paying just for that project. You&#8217;re paying for the time I&#8217;m not being with them.</p>
<p>And so, when that clicked in my brain many years ago, that changes your margin, that changes the value of what you&#8217;re offering. And time to ask me to not be with my wife and my girls, like I said, some time I can give you, but the time you&#8217;re going to take from them, it&#8217;s worth something to me. So, it&#8217;s got to be important. That&#8217;s why the project has to resonate with me. So, that&#8217;s how I really keep that balance.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That is so deep. That is probably one of the deepest things I&#8217;ve heard on this show, and I&#8217;ve been doing this for 10 years.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Wow. Wow.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
No, seriously. It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re not just paying for my expertise and time; you&#8217;re paying for time away from the people that I care about. That&#8217;s deep. Wow. That resonated with me. Thank you. Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah. And with that, if I could just compound on top of that, it&#8217;s where, obviously with projects, you&#8217;re not paid in hourly sense, but a lot of people understand the concept of getting paid hourly. So, if you ask the person that, would you not spend time with your family for five bucks an hour? Most people would say no. And so, if you just keep going up the ladder with the amount, there may be a threshold where people would think about it. But that starts to help you to appreciate that there&#8217;s a value add there. That I&#8217;m not just going to not spend time with my family and exclusively give mental and emotional energy to your project for any amount. No, there&#8217;s a value thing to that.</p>
<p>Also, like we touched on earlier, I forget the book that I read, but they said that don&#8217;t spend time doing something that you could pay someone else minimum wage to do. Obviously, when we&#8217;re starting out, and that&#8217;s what has almost changed my brain. And that&#8217;s what made me, like we talked about earlier, we put together a team. And I&#8217;ve got assistants and people that handle that because it just doesn&#8217;t make sense for me to do something that I could pay someone 10, 15, 20, 30 bucks an hour to do when, my time, I could be doing something that makes way more than that. You get what I&#8217;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah, it doesn&#8217;t add up. But a lot of people think, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m giving away money. I can keep that.&#8221; Yeah, but your time is a non-renewable resource, so you got the time that you do sell, it&#8217;s got to be at the right price.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, and I think that becomes even more important, especially when you have a family, when you start getting older, when other members of your family start getting older. There&#8217;s no amount of money that can buy that time back.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
When you look back at your career, is there a particular moment or a particular experience that stands out to you the most?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Man, I have a few. And one, I would say, is when I get an award at a juried art exhibition here at Downtown Grand Rapids. That was a very nice privilege. And like I mentioned, starting out with Dudley Graphics, and my drawing ability was not up to par by any means, any stretch. And so, to work hard to improve my understanding of light and shadow and composition and all of that, to get to the point where to be accepted into the juried exhibition again. And you&#8217;re paying to have your artwork reviewed and they can just send a no. To get accepted, to get the award, to have my work purchased and so forth, that was a milestone where I felt, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m pretty good at this.&#8221; Then it really gave me the confidence that I can take this to other levels.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
What&#8217;s the most important lesson you say you&#8217;ve learned throughout your career as an artist?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Again, sounds cliche, but to truly stay humble. Humility is something that can slip away. And that&#8217;s why I say it&#8217;s stay humble because it can be a constant fight for all of us. You&#8217;re this imperfect person, but to really strive to maintain humility and never stop learning in your craft. And so, even when I meet with clients now, I tell them, I say, &#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re hiring me because I have a skillset that you don&#8217;t have, but I want to do what&#8217;s in the best interest of the project, not what&#8217;s in my best interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, if you have an idea, even though you can&#8217;t draw, please tell me. If you can defend your idea, because I&#8217;m looking at as an illustrator, I need to be able to defend my choices that I make artistically that, oh, the composition is this way because of that, that way because of this. But if someone shoots an idea to me and I realize that your idea is better than the one I had, hey, let&#8217;s make the change to make the project better.</p>
<p>So, that humility, even the face of you have a skillset that someone else doesn&#8217;t have, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they can&#8217;t suggest something that&#8217;s better. So, that&#8217;s what I really strive for. And never stop learning. I feel like I&#8217;m decent at drawing and I&#8217;ve been learning this craft since I was a little kid. And some days, it feels like I can&#8217;t draw. Like, &#8220;Man, what are you doing?&#8221; And other days it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re pretty good. You got this.&#8221; But yeah, never stop learning and never think you just got it down.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Now, all of your daughters can draw too. Is that right?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yes. I jokingly what they say, joking but not joking. I made them learn how to draw, and there were times with each one of them. My oldest is almost 20, almost 20, 16 and 15. And they would see me drawing and I would teach them how to draw. I didn&#8217;t tell them that it looked good when it didn&#8217;t when they were young. I didn&#8217;t crush their feelings, but if something was off, I told them. I didn&#8217;t just put it on the refrigerator just because they drew it type of thing.</p>
<p>There were times with all of them that there were tears. And I would ask them, &#8220;Do you really want to learn how to do this?&#8221; And with tears in their eyes, each one of them, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yes, I do, daddy.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, you see that the eye is crooked. How do we fix it?&#8221; And it&#8217;s helped them to really grow. And if I could share just a brief story with that.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
When I was teaching my oldest how to read, it dawned on me that this is hard because if you can picture this, you know how we write, the kid learns how to write the alphabet. What I did was, so to make an A, there&#8217;s three lines that you use to make an A, right? Then there&#8217;s one line and two bumps to make a B. And this curve line to make a C. So, what I did was I wrote an A, but I kept all the lines. Just imagine doing the first line on this part of the page. Second line over here. And I did the whole alphabet that way on a piece of paper and it looked like a jumbled mess.</p>
<p>But then I thought that I&#8217;m asking my daughter to figure this out, learn how to put the lines together, so that they can make all the letters. Then we asked them to learn the name of the letters, the sound of the letters, how to put them together to make a word, how to put those together to make a sentence, a paragraph, and then you got to do it with math. And I thought, &#8220;Man, learning how to draw is easier.&#8221; Then the thing, Maurice, is that there&#8217;s no reference for that. They have to learn it though.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah, you have to.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
And so, when it hit me that, okay, if you can learn how to read, how to write and how to do math, you can learn how to draw. Then this is a soapbox of mine, but I won&#8217;t belabor it. But when I realized that, I realized, okay, my girls can learn how to draw. They&#8217;re going to learn how to draw at least the basics.</p>
<p>And another thing, at a class that I got to teach, and I&#8217;ll keep this short, is that I told someone, they said, &#8220;Well, no, it&#8217;s just a talent.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, yeah, you can have a little bit of ability, but it gives you maybe a one to three out of a 10.&#8221; But I said, &#8220;We make kids for 13 plus years learn how to read, learn how to write and learn how to do math. Everything else is optional. If we made you from kindergarten to 12th grade, you had to draw every year and you were tested on it, everybody would leave school knowing how to draw at least decently.&#8221;</p>
<p>But if your kid said, &#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s hard.&#8221; You say, &#8220;Okay, quit. Let&#8217;s try and play saxophone or try soccer.&#8221; But if your kid says, &#8220;I&#8217;m struggling with reading,&#8221; you&#8217;re going to learn how to read and we make them do it. And so, that dawned on me. I was like, &#8220;Okay, my girls will learn how to draw.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
I really like that way of looking at it. And you&#8217;re right. I mean, as kids we start off with, I think, a lot of applied art education. In kindergarten and whatever, there&#8217;s finger painting, there&#8217;s drawing and there&#8217;s coloring. I remember being in elementary school and we would get these sheets of paper that have it&#8217;s blank at the top, and then there&#8217;s lined rules at the bottom for writing. And you had to draw something at the top and then tell the story at the bottom of it.</p>
<p>I actually still have them. I still kept all of my mine from being a kid. But the older I got, I remember art stuff just kept getting phased out, phased out, phased out. I had taken gifted courses. I think they called it enrichment back then, but they were gifted courses. And it felt like those were the only times when I got to do something that felt creative because everything else was towards some specific application. Like you&#8217;re learning English to learn how to read and how to write. You&#8217;re learning math for those applications and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And just the older you get, even if you are really into art and drawing and stuff like that, it&#8217;s increasingly treated as a hobby and not as also a fundamental thing to understand. It&#8217;s just the world that we live in because as you alluded to, well, you didn&#8217;t allude to this really in the interview, but before that we talked about this, everything is designed. Everything that we use in the modern world has went through some lens or filter of design in some capacity. The chair we sit in, the clothes we wear, the picture we write with.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
All of those are designed. And because we interact with these designed things on such a regular basis, almost on a subconscious basis, we know when something is not designed well.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
We know when this pen is bad or this shirt doesn&#8217;t feel right. We know that. We may not have the language for it, sort of speaking what we talked about with English and math and stuff, because that&#8217;s not really taught to us as we get older.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
So true. So true. And I remember someone asked me, &#8220;Oh, what do you do?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I draw and do illustration.&#8221; And the look on her face. And she said this to me, man. She said, &#8220;You might as well have told me you could fly. You can draw?&#8221; And she was just so shocked. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ve been drawing and learning this for decades.&#8221; But what I&#8217;ve found is that artists, well, specifically with visual artists, we&#8217;ve done it before there was any incentive to do it. And so, that&#8217;s what I think makes it so amazing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like when someone sees someone that can do back flips and do all this stuff, but they&#8217;re not in the Olympics, they&#8217;re not getting paid. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Wow, how did you learn how to do all that?&#8221; They did it because they loved it. And another point I&#8217;ll make is that it shows that, if you&#8217;re given the right incentive and you can do it because of the right incentive, that shows that you could do it all along.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll use the example sometime. Usain Bolt, fastest man. He&#8217;s run the 100 meters in 9.58, I think it was. Now, if someone says, &#8220;Hey, I need you to do that in a year. You need to be able to run a sub-10 100 meters. I can&#8217;t do it. Right? There&#8217;s no amount of money. I can&#8217;t do it. But if someone says, &#8220;Okay, I need you to learn how to draw by next year decently and I&#8217;m going to give you $10 million.&#8221; What happens? You start practicing every single day. And guess what? At the end of the year, you&#8217;re going to be pretty decent at drawing and get that $10 million, which means you could do it all along, but you didn&#8217;t have the incentive.</p>
<p>Yeah, so as artists, we learn. We love it, so you learn how to do it and then later, you make a few dollars from it. And it seems amazing because most people, like you said, they veer off that creative path. Then you get older where you need money, and then I haven&#8217;t learned how to draw, so no one&#8217;s going to pay me with the skillset I have now. So, I got to go work over here and make some money. But yeah, it&#8217;s a awesome thing. Everybody can learn how to draw, but it&#8217;s cool being one of the few in the world that can.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Do you have a dream project or something that you love to do one day?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Dream project? Well, actually, one of my dream projects is a book that I wrote. The book that I just finished up, I&#8217;m the author and illustrator and the collaborator with Michael Chambers. He&#8217;s featured in the book, but I&#8217;m actually the author and the illustrator of the book. So, it&#8217;s my book per se. But my dream book, actually, I wrote a couple of years ago, and I have just got around to illustrating my own work. This one is called Duddles and the Big Dilemma, and it is a book about that very thing we just discussed about learning to draw and how everybody thinks it&#8217;s magical, but it&#8217;s more work than just talent.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s amazing to me is that in the book and it explains it, no one says you&#8217;re just an amazing gifted plumber or an amazing gifted carpenter or you just naturally know how to whatever. But when it comes to the arts, people want to put this fairy dust on it. Whereas, what is it, I think Malcolm Gladwell is in his book Outliers, he said that you&#8217;ve never seen someone who is good, but they haven&#8217;t put into practice, in the work, deliberate practice.</p>
<p>And so, that&#8217;s one of my dream projects is to finish that, the illustrations for it and really get that book out there. It&#8217;s called Duddles and the Dilemma. Well, I won&#8217;t want to give a lot away. I&#8217;m going to finish this project probably within the next year or so, and there&#8217;s a series to the book as well. But it&#8217;s about him realizing that it&#8217;s not all fairy dust. You got to put in work to learn to draw. It&#8217;s not a magical thing, and that&#8217;s just the truth of it. And a lot of people don&#8217;t want to believe that, but I wish there was just a download that gave me all this knowledge that I&#8217;ve learned over the last 30 plus years. I wish it was that easy, but yeah.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Yeah. So, to that end, what do you see as the next chapter of your career? What do you want to do in the next five years or so? What do you see yourself?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah. Well, more books. Right now, as I mentioned, we just launched the book with Michael Chambers, Lil&#8217; Boogaloo Shrimp and the Clean Sweep. And so, I see the direction of doing more art talks and events with kids. We are actually partnering with a nonprofit here locally. I mentioned about the breakdancing school there in Georgia, but there&#8217;s one in Colorado that we&#8217;re going to be touching base with. And so, I think that&#8217;s going to really be exploding. We&#8217;ve already talked to Rockwell Dance Academy about a book project, and so, that&#8217;s on the horizon. And in the next couple of years, just more books. More books, man.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
More books. Well, just to wrap things up here, Chris, where can our audience find out more information about you, about your work, about the books? Where can they find that information online?</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Well, my website is chrisdudleyart.com and that&#8217;s where you can see my portfolio, my body of work and anybody can reach out and contact me directly through that. But my books are available through hudsondawnpublishing.com that I&#8217;m connected with, hudsondawnpublishing.com. And that&#8217;s where all of the books that I&#8217;ve illustrated are available. And that&#8217;s been awesome being connected with them. I actually designed the logo. And my oldest daughter, she launched the publishing company. She put a team together. I was joking around about it, designed a logo. She launched it during the pandemic. Got with an artist and made a book and got it out. And I was like, &#8220;Wow.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
And so, since then she has worked with, wow, probably 10 authors. I&#8217;ve illustrated a lot of the books, but she&#8217;s working with, I think, five new authors right now and that&#8217;ll be on that site. So, yeah, it&#8217;s been awesome. She has printeries. It&#8217;s established printeries locally in Michigan actually, in the west and east side of the state. Got warehousing. So, she&#8217;s taken that to the next level beyond what I ever thought that could be.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
That&#8217;s amazing. It&#8217;s a whole family operation. It&#8217;s a family affair.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Yeah, definitely, definitely. Yeah, hudsondawnpublishing.com.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Awesome.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
And actually, the recent book, you can read the intro of the book right there online.</p>
<p><b>Maurice Cherry:</b><br>
Okay. Yeah, we&#8217;ll definitely put a link to that in the show notes.</p>
<p>Chris Dudley, I want to thank you so, so much for taking time out and coming on the show. I mean, it always warms my heart to talk to people that have been doing this kind of work for years on years on years because the longevity in just this industry is something that you don&#8217;t really see from Black creatives. You can get burned out. We can get discouraged, et cetera. And it really feels like you have found a method and a calling and a passion in this work, and you found a way to not only sustain it for yourself, but also for your family and for the community that you&#8217;re in.</p>
<p>I think that is something that is super inspiring. I think any artist wants to make sure that their work has an impact in the world. And most certainly, I can tell just from your passion about it and how you talk about it and just the quality of the work, that you&#8217;re making an impact in the world with everything that you do. So, thank you so much for coming on the show. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dudley:</b><br>
Well, thank you for having me. It&#8217;s been such a privilege. I truly appreciate and look forward to touching base with you soon.</p>
